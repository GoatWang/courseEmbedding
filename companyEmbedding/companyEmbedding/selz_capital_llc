Frequently Asked Questions





            General questions
          



Is there a setup fee?
No. There are no setup fees on any of our plans.

 
Do I need to enter my credit card details to sign up?
No. You can sign up and use Shopify for 14 days without entering your credit card details. At the end of your trial, or when you decide to launch your store, you will need to pick a plan and enter your credit card details.

 
Can I cancel my account at any time?
Yes. If you ever decide that Shopify isn’t the best ecommerce platform for your business, simply cancel your account.

 
How long are your contracts?
All Shopify plans are month to month unless you sign up for an annual or biennial plan.

 
Do you offer any discounted plans?
Yes, we offer a 10% discount on annual plans and a 20% discount on biennial plans, when they are paid upfront.

 
Can I change my plan later on?
Absolutely! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.

 
Is Shopify PCI Compliant or PCI Certified?
Yes. Shopify is certified Level 1 PCI DSS compliant. This means all your data and customer information is ultra secure.

 
Do I have to sell the same products in-store as I do online?
No, you can choose exactly what products to sell online, in-store, or both.

 
What is the rate if I type in a credit card?
If you chose to type in a credit card number instead of using the Shopify credit card reader, you will be charged the same rate as your online rate.



Are there any transaction fees?
Use Shopify Payments and pay no transaction fee. If you choose an
external payment gateway, there will be additional fees of 2%, 1% or
0.5% for our Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify plans,
respectively.

 






            Online questions
          



Can I use my own domain name?
Yes. You can purchase a domain name within Shopify, or use an existing one that you own. We also provide a free myshopify.com domain name to all stores on sign up.



What are your bandwidth fees?
There are none. All Shopify plans include unlimited bandwidth for free.



Do I need a web host?
Shopify includes secure, unlimited ecommerce hosting on all plans except Shopify Lite. You can also use the Buy Button to add ecommerce to any existing website.

 




              POS questions
            



What does Shopify POS do?
Shopify POS is an application for iOS and Android devices that you can
use for transactions in a physical store or pop-up setting. Find
products, process orders, take payment, swipe credit cards, produce
receipts, and control it all from your iPad or mobile device. All the
background management of your store is done from your Shopify admin,
which you can access using any browser.



Can I merge my Shopify online store with Shopify POS?
Yes. Your Shopify online store automatically synchronizes with Shopify
POS, and you manage your entire business from one dashboard. Product or
inventory updates that you make in your Shopify admin will instantly
take effect in Shopify POS.



Can I use Shopify POS if I have multiple cash registers in use at the same time?
Yes. You can install Shopify POS on multiple devices, and you won’t be
charged any extra. Store activity on all devices is synchronized with
your Shopify admin.



Can I use Shopify POS if I’m outside the United States/Canada?
The Shopify POS app is available worldwide. There are just two
important considerations:

You'll have to buy the supported hardware through an external
retailer.
You'll have to use an external credit card terminal to
accept credit cards.




Where can I buy a cash register, receipt printer, and other hardware?
You can buy hardware kits and individual items of supported hardware from the Shopify
Hardware Store in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the continental United States. Outside of
these countries, supported hardware is available from authorized
resellers.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Frequently Asked Questions





            General questions
          



Is there a setup fee?
No. There are no setup fees on any of our plans.

 
Do I need to enter my credit card details to sign up?
No. You can sign up and use Shopify for 14 days without entering your credit card details. At the end of your trial, or when you decide to launch your store, you will need to pick a plan and enter your credit card details.

 
Can I cancel my account at any time?
Yes. If you ever decide that Shopify isn’t the best ecommerce platform for your business, simply cancel your account.

 
How long are your contracts?
All Shopify plans are month to month unless you sign up for an annual or biennial plan.

 
Do you offer any discounted plans?
Yes, we offer a 10% discount on annual plans and a 20% discount on biennial plans, when they are paid upfront.

 
Can I change my plan later on?
Absolutely! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.

 
Is Shopify PCI Compliant or PCI Certified?
Yes. Shopify is certified Level 1 PCI DSS compliant. This means all your data and customer information is ultra secure.

 
Do I have to sell the same products in-store as I do online?
No, you can choose exactly what products to sell online, in-store, or both.

 
What is the rate if I type in a credit card?
If you chose to type in a credit card number instead of using the Shopify credit card reader, you will be charged the same rate as your online rate.



Are there any transaction fees?
Use Shopify Payments and pay no transaction fee. If you choose an
external payment gateway, there will be additional fees of 2%, 1% or
0.5% for our Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify plans,
respectively.

 






            Online questions
          



Can I use my own domain name?
Yes. You can purchase a domain name within Shopify, or use an existing one that you own. We also provide a free myshopify.com domain name to all stores on sign up.



What are your bandwidth fees?
There are none. All Shopify plans include unlimited bandwidth for free.



Do I need a web host?
Shopify includes secure, unlimited ecommerce hosting on all plans except Shopify Lite. You can also use the Buy Button to add ecommerce to any existing website.

 




              POS questions
            



What does Shopify POS do?
Shopify POS is an application for iOS and Android devices that you can
use for transactions in a physical store or pop-up setting. Find
products, process orders, take payment, swipe credit cards, produce
receipts, and control it all from your iPad or mobile device. All the
background management of your store is done from your Shopify admin,
which you can access using any browser.



Can I merge my Shopify online store with Shopify POS?
Yes. Your Shopify online store automatically synchronizes with Shopify
POS, and you manage your entire business from one dashboard. Product or
inventory updates that you make in your Shopify admin will instantly
take effect in Shopify POS.



Can I use Shopify POS if I have multiple cash registers in use at the same time?
Yes. You can install Shopify POS on multiple devices, and you won’t be
charged any extra. Store activity on all devices is synchronized with
your Shopify admin.



Can I use Shopify POS if I’m outside the United States/Canada?
The Shopify POS app is available worldwide. There are just two
important considerations:

You'll have to buy the supported hardware through an external
retailer.
You'll have to use an external credit card terminal to
accept credit cards.




Where can I buy a cash register, receipt printer, and other hardware?
You can buy hardware kits and individual items of supported hardware from the Shopify
Hardware Store in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the continental United States. Outside of
these countries, supported hardware is available from authorized
resellers.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
