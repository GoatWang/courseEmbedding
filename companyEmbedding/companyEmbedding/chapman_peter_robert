After his arrest in late 2014, he awaited extradition on corruption charges, for almost six months, in the Ary Franco prison.This prison is notorious. Brazil's then justice minister, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, once said he would prefer death to serving time there.

In 2012, the United Nations subcommittee on the prevention of torture visited Ary Franco, then told the Brazilian government it should be immediately closed down.Chapman and his fellow inmates sat in dark, filthy, stuffy cells that were infested with cockroaches and other insects, and were so overcrowded that inmates took turns sleeping on the floor.

In some cells, sewage seeped from leaky pipes in the ceiling. And there were more immediate health concerns: cellblocks were divided along the lines of the factions – huge Brazilian organised crime groups – and inmates had to sign an agreement assuming responsibility for their own safety in that regard.

Chapman was not unfamiliar with difficult, dangerous situations: he had made his living, and boasted considerable expertise, as an entrepreneur in some of the more adventurous corners of African and South American commerce.

But he was also used to the finer things in life. He had rubbed shoulders with diplomats, politicians and business leaders. He had worked hard and travelled the world, and put together a tidy nest egg.Then, over three months in early 2009, shortly before retiring (for health reasons) to live in his adopted home town of Rio, he made a terrible, life-changing mistake. In pursuit of a juicy business deal, he bribed an official in one of the most corrupt countries on Earth: Nigeria.

And so he found himself rubbing shoulders with faction members in the overcrowded Ary Franco cells, his fellow inmates pasty, hunched, many with festering, life-threatening injuries, deliberately kneecapped by arresting police.Many were young men, who told him they expected to be dead before their 30th birthday, murdered by rivals, before they could claim their factional pension and retire.Over sleepless nights in this nightmare new home, Chapman was left to ponder his crime, which he furiously denied to the very last moment of his trial in London's Southwark Crown Court over the past month and a half.His trial coincided with an international summit on corruption, which was cited by his sentencing judge. Bizarrely, just a day before his jury reached their verdict, British Prime Minister David Cameron was overheard telling the Queen that Nigeria was "fantastically corrupt", a comment that unwittingly almost derailed the trial, and which Chapman feared had finally turned the wavering jury against him.But the trial had a bittersweet end. Most sentencing judges find stern words for the defendant. But Judge Michael Grieve, QC seemed equally angry at Chapman's former employer, Australian banknote company Securency, and its senior management who, he said, had pushed Chapman into corruption.On Wednesday, Chapman had shaken his head at the four guilty verdicts. On Thursday, he was given a sentence that effectively set him free (due to time served in Ary Franco and London's shabby old Wandsworth).He gave a little nod. In effect he had been told: you have done wrong, but you have suffered enough.Chapman, 54, hails from the picturesque Buckinghamshire town of Aylesbury. Before joining Securency, he had worked as a sales manager for a company that printed lottery tickets for South America, and in their banknote printing division.He learnt the business of banknotes: from the high level of how they worked to oil an economy, right down to the ink-stained practicality of a mint floor.Then, in mid-2003, he got a call from Hugh Brown, a man who used to work for the same company as Chapman but was now a senior sales executive at Securency, a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of Australia.Securency had a golden goose: the patent for a sophisticated plastic polymer, a one-of-a-kind substance that could be used to replace paper banknotes with durable, hard-to-counterfeit plastic.It was invented by the CSIRO, then Securency was formed to commercialise the product. Securency "wanted to polymerise the world", Chapman said in evidence.But he wasn't overly impressed with the way it was run."It was very strange," he said. "When I first got there, I was struck by the fact it was almost like a virtual company. It didn't have the normal core functions I was used to."It was like all the staff were almost like freelancers, like satellites doing their own thing. I wasn't used to that and I didn't like that."[It was] horribly inefficient … they had some very good plans but not much idea how to execute those plans."Chapman was made the director of business development for Africa then, two years later in 2008, promoted to director of regional sales for Africa.Most of his efforts were concentrated on Nigeria.It was by far the most dangerous country of all Securency's clients, and it got worse during Chapman's time there. Ex-pats were often kidnapped. The roads and even many hotels were "not for the faint hearted", he said. In 2007, the Australian High Commission and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade withdrew non-essential staff.But Chapman stuck in there because the upside was huge. When just one banknote, the 20 naira, was converted to plastic, it was worth tens of millions of euros a year for Securency, and Chapman took a nice commission on top of his salary.And if he could get the other denominations, too, it would be a bonanza. And not just in Nigeria. As Chapman said in evidence: "If we could show polymer could be printed in the worst banknote patch in Africa, and through that it became one of the best banknote printers in Africa, that would be an enormously good example to show the rest of the world".But he had made contact with his own official in his own patch, his ace in the hole: an influential employee at Nigeria's mint.Due to a court order in the UK, Fairfax Media must not identify the man, whom we shall call Mr N.They had met first in London, around 2001, at a business seminar in a "dismal" Holiday Inn in Ealing off the A40.When they met again in Nigeria, they became close friends and business allies. Chapman was regularly in contact with him, they exchanged emails. Chapman even drafted emails for the man.Chapman said his relationship with Mr N was valuable. Good contacts and good intelligence were vital to good business."What were your reasons for having a relationship with Mr N?," Chapman was asked by his lawyer during the trial.There was a very long pause."There are a number," Chapman eventually said. "We had to work together, we liked each other, we got on very well. Our interests, our strategies perfectly aligned … he was a very useful sounding board for cross-checking what I'd heard from other sources. And vice versa he'd bounce things off me."We were a similar age, had a similar sense of humour. We both liked football, he liked Chelsea, I liked Tottenham. We used to recommend books to each other, literature, we had similar tastes. A whole range of personal similarities."His lawyer David Spens, QC asked Chapman: "Did you trust him?""Yes," Chapman replied.But one aspect of Chapman's relationship with Mr N went beyond normal friendship. Several times, he arranged for large sums of money to be transferred to the man, payments that did not appear in Chapman's regular, meticulous expense reports, nor were they explained by any business contract in evidence in the trial.At the trial, Chapman's defence was that he was repaying cash loans that Mr N had provided him in local currency in Nigeria.Chapman said Nigeria was "very much a cash-based society at the time" and credit cards were almost unusable outside major tourist hotels."Whenever you go out and about, you need cash, that's what you had to carry all of the time," he said. "I always had lots of it to hand." Chapman claimed that the easiest way for him to get cash was from his good friend, Mr N.He would borrow it for business expenses, such as travel, or drivers or a security detail. Then a while later, he claimed, he would repay it."Um, we had a conversation, I was having trouble getting naira easily," Chapman said on the witness stand. "He said, 'oh I always have naira and it suits me to have it in the UK or elsewhere' and that's how it started."I saw nothing wrong with it."The bribes – which is what they, in fact, were, the jury decided, rather than loan repayments – went through an odd route and ended up with Mr N over three months in early 2009.The first bribe for which he was found guilty moved from Securency to a company called SPT Ltd, based in the Seychelles, which Chapman had helped set up and was now acting as Securency's agent in Nigeria. From there it went to Swingaxle, Chapman's own company, which he also set up in the Seychelles. From there, £40,000 ($78,000) went into the UK bank account of Mr N. In one bank transfer document it was described as a "spare parts consignment".The second bribe, of $US34,927.50 ($47,690), went from Securency, to SPT, to Swingaxle. It jumped through two of Swingaxle's Seychelles bank accounts then ended up at a company in Nigeria that Mr N had set up.The company was a front. It had no obvious connection to Mr N, and he had used signatures and photographs of other people to set up its bank account. However, he was the beneficial owner.Chapman said he never questioned why Mr N had asked the money to be paid there.The third and fourth bribes, of US$54,915 each, ended up at that company also. However, they had an unclear origin. It may have been Chapman's own money, sourced from a pair of offshore trusts of which Chapman was the "protector".These last two bribes appear not to have come from Securency, at least not directly. The court heard evidence that, by this stage,  Fairfax Media had broken the news of a bribery scandal at the company, and Securency was getting leery about sending undocumented payments to its agents.The jury might have believed Chapman's story about cash loans from Mr N. The members found him not guilty on two counts, of alleged earlier bribes in 2007 and 2008, which Chapman had said were the repayment of loans to Mr N.However, they decided (by majority verdict) the four payments in early 2009 were bribes.That period was a crucial time for Securency's business in Nigeria. They were on the verge of closing the long sought-after deal to convert three other denomination notes into plastic. And they were keen to convert a "letter of intent" from the Nigerian mint into a firm order.They were also under huge pressure from the company board to get orders on the books, and they were passing that pressure on to Chapman.The prosecution said the orders might "naturally" have happened anyway, but the bribes made it happen more quickly.Emails between company executives, to which Chapman was privy, were frantic. "We are fast running out of time and have a board meeting at the beginning of March," said one. "It is becoming a very critical situation for us."Another email talked about the need "to get the big one across the line".In one email to his superiors about this time, Chapman said, enigmatically: "There are some aspects to this I need to discuss, but essentially this particular rabbit will jump out of the same battered hat again. Details to follow but they are likely to be along the same lines as the last rabbit."Another email was also highlighted by the prosecution: about the time that two of the bribes were paid, Chapman promised to "shake the burning bush again" while talking about Mr N."Excellent progress," came the reply from management in Australia. "Next week could be the turning point for our business and I await with bated breath. Please do all you can to finalise the order from the [mint] as things are getting very tight here".When the order finally came through in March for the new denominations, they were ecstatic. "Don't you just love it when the plan comes to fruition – well done squire!"The key witness for the prosecution was David Ellery, Securency's former principal financial officer.The defence worked hard to destroy Ellery's credibility with the jury.They showed he had lied before in trying to avoid responsibility for his own role in Securency-paid bribes in other countries. And they pointed out that Ellery had promised to give evidence against other Securency employees, as part of a bargain with police to downgrade charges against him.In his closing address, defence barrister Mr Spens said it was "an absolutely classic case of a witness prepared to implicate others to save his own precious skin – there is no good reason why you should believe him".But in the end, the jury appears to have believed Ellery's evidence over Chapman's. And it was highly incriminating.Ellery testified about a meeting where Chapman "was somewhat upset because the majority of the sales for the year had come out of his territory, Nigeria – he felt an unreasonable amount of pressure was being put on him to achieve sales". Ellery said discussion focused on bringing forward an order from next year "so the forward order book would look stronger than was actually the case".Chapman "indicated that there would be a cost involved", he said.Initially that cost was thought to perhaps be taking some Nigerians on a tour to Australia, spoiling them with first-class airfares.But in a subsequent phone conversation, Chapman "indicated he had agreed to pay an official a sum of money", Ellery said. Securency would reimburse the cost of the bribe."My recollection of the conversation was that the payment was taken as a cost of doing business … at the time there was disappointment but I agreed to proceed with it."Hearing this evidence, Chapman laughed in the dock.In sentencing Ellery, Judge Grieve said a "significant factor" in mitigating Chapman's sentence was the role of Securency management."I accept that you were put under considerable pressure by your superiors to achieve sales and you complained about that to them," Judge Grieve said, adding this was a significant factor in mitigating the sentence."Senior management, from the managing director down, gave you the go-ahead [for the bribes]," he said. "The prosecution case throughout was that you acted with their encouragement or at least their connivance."Chapman, usually animated in the dock, sat stoney faced as the sentence was read out: 30 months. Taking into account the 520 days he had already spent in jail, in Brazil and Britain, it meant he need serve no more jail time.After an afternoon of prison bureaucracy, he walked out of the court, a convicted criminal but a free man. Another chapter of the Securency scandal was closed.Follow FairfaxForeign on TwitterFollow Fairfax Foreign on Facebook

Editorial Reviews


Zom Zoms
The fifth edition of the classic "Roget's International Thesaurus" includes more than 325,000 words and phrases (up from 250,000 in the fourth edition) grouped according to ideas into 15 classes and further subdivided into 1,073 major categories. In this completely revised and reorganized edition, 31 new major categories have been added, including such topics as substance abuse and computer science, in order to make this resource more reflective of modern society. Within the 1,073 major categories, ideas are further broken down into paragraphs, each of which reflects more discrete connotative or part-of-speech groupings. In an effort to more clearly distinguish between groups of synonyms within a paragraph, synomyms that are closest in meaning to each other are "offered in clusters that are set off with semicolons," which indicate changes in sense or application. Also, foreign and technical terms are identified by labels in angle brackets (e.g., "starets" >; "Animalia >)
   Also helpful are the use of boldface for synonyms most often used for the idea being represented; lists of words that fit within a category but do not have synomyms (e.g., a list of phobias is found under "phobias by name"; a list of various football plays can be found under "football plays and calls"); "see" references to the number at which a listed synonym can be found as a headword; and the inclusion of quotations (referenced to a person but not to a source) that refer to a guideword or category. The comprehensive index refers back to category and paragraph, allowing the reader to zero in to the right spot on the page
   Since the thesaurus is arranged topically, it stands quite apart from other thesauruses that are arranged alphabetically. Other differences are also noted. In terms of sheer number of synonyms provided, "Roget's" has more than either "Webster's New Dictionary of Synomyms" (Merriam-Webster, 1984) or the "Random House Thesaurus College Edition" (Random, 1984). However, both "Webster's" and "Random House" provide antonyms, and "Webster's" also provides contrasting and analogous words. Additionally, unlike "Roget's", which does not define guidewords or synonyms, both "Webster's" and "Random House" provide some definitions. "Random House" uses guidewords in sentences, and "Webster's" provides explanatory paragraphs in which major synonyms are clearly differentiated in terms of their connotations. Both "Webster's" and "Roget's" also provide quotations that help to clarify or expand the nuances of listed words
   Finally, in terms of ease of use, although the alphabetically arranged sources require less page turning, "Roget's" idea-based groupings facilitate creative generation of synonyms as well as easier browsing (once one has found the correct classified area)
   The fifth edition of "Roget's" is a handsome product whose larger print and uncluttered pages are unintimidating. For junior high or high school, public, and academic libraries, the sheer number of words presented in "Roget's" makes it clearly a first purchase. However, since it seems to be geared toward people who know the English language, it should probably sit next to "Webster's New Dictionary of Synonyms", whose clear distinctions between fewer words make it a first purchase for nonnative speakers as well as less sophisticated or younger writers. And, as "Roget's" urges, all thesauruses should be used in conjunction with a good dictionary in order to ensure that a selected synonym, which may be unfamiliar to the user, is appropriate.

Read an Excerpt


Publisher's PrefaceLike all great reference books, Roget's International Thesaurus® is the product of continuous improvement and long-term investment. The process began almost two centuries ago, in 1805, when Dr. Peter Mark Roget began compiling a list of useful words for his own convenience.There have been glossaries and word lists since literature began. The revolutionary achievement of Dr. Roget, a physician with a penchant for organization, was his development of a brand new principle: the grouping of words according to ideas. This mechanism eliminates the need for groping through the entire alphabet posed by word books arranged in dictionary form (i.e. alphabetically), thus greatly increasing the efficiency of locating just the right word or expression for a particular circumstance. When in 1852 Roget published the first book ever to realize this concept with thoroughness and precision, he called it a "thesaurus" (from the Greek and Latin, meaning "treasury" or "storehouse"). And thesaurus it has remained to this day.So successful was Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases, Classified and Arranged so as to Facilitate the Expression of Ideas and Assist in Literary Composition that a second edition followed one year later in 1853. By Dr. Roget's death in 1869 there had been no less than twenty-eight editions and printings.Thomas Y. Crowell acquired the thesaurus from Roget's son, Dr. John Lewis Roget, and published the first Crowell edition in 1886. Roget's International Thesaurus® remained within the Crowell publishingfamily for the next nearly one hundred years. Each subsequent edition introduced more efficient and useful features, all of which have contributed to the quality of the present edition. Over the years, tens of thousands of new words and phrases were added, the coverage of foreign expressions increased, and the scope of the book expanded to include slang and useful quotations; a recent innovation was the numbering of the paragraphs for the user's convenience. By 1977, when the fourth edition was published by Harper & Row, Roget's International Thesaurus® had become a greatly expanded and improved book, yet one which still retained Roget's brilliant organization.It is with a very special sense of pride that we present this fifth edition of Roget's International Thesaurus®. Along with the addition of new words and phrases, considerable updating and refinements in format and style, the most significant changes in this fifth edition are the rearrangement of the categories and the introduction of new ones to enable fuller coverage of terms of our times. Dr. Robert L. Chapman, revising editor for this new edition, explains the details and reasoning behind these changes in his Foreword.A work of this scope is only possible through the combined effort of many people. We wish to particularly acknowledge the superior work of Dr. Robert L. Chapman, who reorganized, rethought and rewrote this edition.Computer technology has made working with the technical aspects of the book more efficient. We wish to thank George Alexander for his valuable contributions. Our thanks for the editorial contributions of Andrea Sargent, Mary Kay Linge, Jill Korey, Kenneth Wright, Joe Ford, Ruth Koenisberg, Pamela Marshall, Dave Prout, Ellen Zucker, Frank Gribbon and Edward Mansour.A special thanks to John Day, supervisor of reference production, who oversaw the complexity of turning the many discs and printouts during the various stages of development into final discs for composition. Our thanks to his staff: Douglas Elam, Elaine Verriest, Celeste Bantz, Ryon Fleming, Jim Hornfischer, Dorian Yeager, and Craig Young. Our appreciation to C. Linda Dingler for the new design; to Dianne Pinkowitz, Joseph Montebello and Helen Moore. And last, we wish to acknowledge the valuable contributions of Mark Liberman and Ken Church of Bell Labs.Carol CohenPublisher, HarperReference Roget's International Thesaurus.

Chapman

Chapman is an English surname derived from the Old English occupational name céapmann “marketman, monger, merchant”, from the verb céapan, cypan “to buy or sell” and the noun form ceap "barter, business; a purchase." Alternate spellings include Caepmon, Cepeman, Chepmon, Cypman(n), and Shapman. (By 1600, the occupational name chapman had come to be applied to an itinerant dealer in particular, but it remained in use for both "customer, buyer" and "merchant" in the 17th and 18th centuries. Modern chiefly British slang chap “man" arose from the use of the abbreviated word to mean a customer, one with whom to bargain.)
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) supplies four meanings for chapman, all of which pertain to buying and selling: 1) A man whose business was buying and selling; 2) an itinerant dealer who travels, also known as a hawker or peddler; 3) an agent in a commercial transaction; 4) a purchaser or customer. (N.B. A “petty chapman” was a retail dealer.) The OED includes a citation of an English ordinance or decree that dates from 1553, during the reign of Edward VI: "No Tinker, Peddler, or petit Chapman shall wander about from the Towne but such as shall be licensed by two Justices of Peace." According to a list of colonial occupations, a chapman is a peddler or dealer of goods, usually itinerant, going from village to village. The related word chapbook is a later coinage from the 19th century which appears to refer to the fact that chapbooks were very cheaply made. From Old English ceap is also derived cheap “inexpensive,” a shortening of good ceap “good buy,” and Cheapside “market place,” a street in London that both historically and in modern times has been the financial center of the city.
Both the compound “chapman” and its first element chap- have cognates in all the major Germanic languages: From the prehistoric West Germanic compound *kaup- are derived cognates Old Saxon cop, Old Frisian kap "trade, purchase," Middle Dutch coop, modern Dutch kopen “buy,” koop "trade, market, bargain and goedkoop “inexpensive." These are akin to Old High German choufman, German Kaufmann, a common modern German surname; and North Germanic forms leading to Old Norse kaup "bargain, pay,” modern Swedish köpa “buy,” and modern Danish kjøb "purchase, bargain" and Copenhagen (originally Køpmannæhafn "merchants' harbor, buyer's haven"). The common ancestor is Proto-Germanic *kaupoz-, which was probably an ancient Germanic borrowing of Latin caupo, caupon- "petty tradesman, huckster," of unknown ulterior etymology. From the German the word was borrowed into the Slavic languages (Old Slavic koupiti, modern Russian купить, etc.), the Baltic languages (Old Prussian kaupiskan “trade, commerce,” Lithuanian kὑpczus “merchant”) and Finnish kaupata “to sell cheaply.” In the Romance languages, however, the word has not survived.
