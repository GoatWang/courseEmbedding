				Names with trims or sells during the year will result in a Statement of Sale to be included with the K-1 package; the Statement of Sale determines adjustments to basis, which together with Form 1099 from the custodian determines profit and loss of MLPs.
			

			Telephone and fax numbers for each MLP can be found at www.taxpackagesupport.com or www.partnerdatalink.com.
				
Finally, please take a look at our client-approved MLP Primer. The MLP Primer, along with other client-approved material, is available at www.mhinvest.com/mlps.




				This presentation is to report on the investment strategies as reported by Miller/Howard Investments and is for illustration purposes only. The information contained herein is obtained from multiple sources and believed to be reliable. Information has not been verified by any custodian, brokerage firm or financial institution, and may differ from documents created by the brokerage firm. For additional information on other programs, please speak to your Financial Advisor.
			
Risk Factors to consider when investing in MLPs:

Cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with the MLP's operating or business performance.
MLPs typically have a General Partner that maintains an aggregate 2% General Partner interest. Unit holders will have limited voting rights and do not own an interest in, vote with, or control the General Partner. The General Partner often cannot be removed without its own consent, and the General Partner has conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of unit holders.
The MLP may issue additional common units, diluting existing unit holders’ interests.
Unit holders may be required to pay taxes on income from the MLP even if they do not receive cash distributions.
The IRS could reclassify the MLP as a taxable entity, which could reduce the cash available for distribution to unit holders.
If at any time the GP owns 85% or more of the issued and outstanding limited partner interests, the GP will have the right to purchase all of the limited partnership interests not held by the GP at a price that may be undesirable.


MLP Tax Considerations: The tax treatment for investors in MLPs is different than that of an investment in stock, including (a) the investor's share of the MLP's income, deductions and expenses are reported on Schedule K-1, not Form 1099, (b) because of the possibility of unrelated business taxable income, charitable remainder trusts should not invest in this strategy, and other non-taxable investors (such as ERISA and IRA accounts) should carefully consider whether to invest in this strategy, (c) investors may have to file income tax returns in states in which the MLP's do business and (d) MLP tax information is sent directly from the partnership which generally has until April 15th to provide this information. You should discuss these and any other tax implications with your tax advisor.				
			
The securities referenced represent a portion or all of the companies held in a representative account in this strategy during the period stated and are intended for informational purposes only. Non-performance based criteria have been used to select the securities listed. The past performance of these stocks is no guarantee of future results. The specific securities identified and described do not represent all of the securities purchased, sold or recommended for this strategy, and the reader should not assume that investments in the securities identified or discussed were or will prove to be profitable.

The information and analyses contained herein are not intended as tax, legal or investment advice and may not be suitable for your specific circumstances; accordingly, you should consult your own tax, legal, investment or other advisors, at both the outset of any transaction and on an ongoing basis, to determine such suitability.

Strategies / Income-Equity Strategy 
											



Income-Equity Strategy






Portfolio Highlights 






Unfixed Income
									Portfolio companies pay and grow dividends, providing high current income and increasing income over time. By focusing on dividend growth, we help clients meet income needs today and in the future.
							

Dividend Growth — A better “Analyst” than Analysts
								Dividend and dividend increases help confirm past and current financial reports and are one of the best signals from management about current and future prospects for a company.
							

Diversified Compounding Machine 
								Over time, it is compounding income — not style, sector, or asset classes — that is a main driver of long-term returns. Investors can reinvest income and dollar cost average, earning on both their original investments and also on their earnings.
							

 

 
 

Portfolio Overview




Income-Equity Strategy is a diversified, dividend-growth equity portfolio that seeks high current dividend income plus growth of income and principal. Stocks are primarily US based, multi-cap companies from across the broad equity market. In the portfolio, 25% can be invested in foreign stocks that trade on US exchanges (ADRs) and up to 25% can be exchange-traded Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).
This strategy has the potential to provide “unfixed income” from stocks with high current yields and growth of cash flow from dividends. Investors seeking solid total returns that comprise both income and growth, high current income that may increase every year, potential for inflation protection, and a lower federal tax rate on qualified dividends will find this strategy attractive. Because this version of Income-Equity includes MLPs, it will generate K-1 tax reports.
 

 
 

Investment Philosophy




Consistent with our firm philosophy, this portfolio invests in financially strong companies with rising dividends. Our disciplined investment process focuses on compounding income — not style, sector, or asset allocation — which is the main driver of long-term returns. Many studies, including our own, show that dividend-paying stocks have historically outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks, and companies that increase their dividends tend to perform the best. Stock prices may fluctuate, but dividends, when paid, are always positive. And unlike bonds (with static income), equities with growth of income help protect investors from the ravages of inflation. Even a “tame” inflation rate of 2.5% can destroy almost two thirds of an investor's purchasing power over 20 years.

 

 
 

Portfolio Objective




Our investment objective is to provide high current income, growth of income, and growth of principal as conservatively as possible while investing in the equity markets. We seek to add value to our clients’ overall investments by lowering volatility, raising the income level, and enhancing total return.
 

 
 

Portfolio Strategy




This portfolio, as with all of our strategies, is team managed. We invest in stocks with solid financial strength (investment grade or better) and moderately steady growth. Our holdings have consistent and reliable business models and a history of high and rising dividends that we project will continue to grow. We focus on essential services, low-cost producers, niche companies, and companies with outstanding consistency in their earnings and dividends. This helps ensure that return expectations are realistic and achievable. Stocks are sold when: a company fails to increase dividends with no reasonable excuse; there is deterioration in a company's fundamentals; a stock exhibits extended overvaluation; there is a negative impact from a regulatory decision; or we need to make room for a more attractive investment.

Firm / Our History 
										



Our History
Miller/Howard Investments Inc. was founded in 1984 as an institutional research firm providing quantitative and technical research on large-capitalization stocks to clients such as Fidelity, CIGNA, USF&G, Delta Airlines, John Templeton, George Soros, Federal Express, and many others.* In 1989, while investigating alternatives to traditional fixed-income vehicles, we conducted a landmark study of the long-term returns of utilities as an asset class. Our research revealed the income-generating, wealth-building potential of dividends over the long term. Based on these findings, we began managing our first utilities portfolio in 1991 founded on our philosophy that internal compounding (high current dividend income plus dividend growth) is the key to building long-term wealth. We hold to the adage, “slow and steady wins the race.”

Founder Lowell Miller, a leading expert on utilities, energy, and listed infrastructure as well as broad market dividend-growth companies, has been a keynote speaker and member of many industry panels, has appeared on Louis Rukeyser's Wall $treet Week and Bloomberg TV, and is regularly quoted in the national financial media. The strong investment team we have built has more than 150 years of combined investment experience.
Our evolution has been significantly influenced by the results of our utility study and the concept of a repeating-business model. In May 1997, we initiated the Income-Equity Strategy, which expands that model to nearly all sectors of the market and emphasizes stable companies that have a high current yield, rising dividend, and that may contain a hidden “growth kicker” that's not built into the stock's price.
Miller/Howard continues to evolve with development of disciplined investment strategies that provide investors with various levels of current income and dividend growth generated by companies with real assets, such as MLPs, companies that provide essential services, and broad market, dividend-focused stocks.

Why Strategic Indexes?
Miller/Howard Strategic Indexes is a subsidiary of Miller/Howard Investments Inc., a boutique asset management firm focused on income-producing equities and the entire energy vertical for more than 25 years. Our investment focus, since inception, has been on high-quality companies that not only pay a high dividend yield, but also have the potential to grow their dividends at above-market averages. We seek both income and opportunities for growth of principal in a single investment.
Our indexes seek to capture and distill all we have learned over nearly a quarter century of active management of dividend and energy infrastructure companies. Our strategic, rules-based indexes are created to enhance current passive approaches to asset allocation.
The indexes are designed to go beyond market exposure by applying persistent, strategic factors we have observed and confirmed through our active management. They find and retain the "good," as opposed to cap-weighted indexes, which in our view hold the good, the bad, and the ugly—by their very nature and definition.
In addition to their "everything but the kitchen sink" approach, traditional market-capitalization-weighted indexes tend to overweight overvalued stocks that have appreciated in price. Miller/Howard Strategic Indexes seeks to improve on this model by equal weighting, and by limiting constituent selection to those companies that share distinct, positive, fundamental factors such as dividend growth, yield, valuation, and profitability—all through a disciplined rules-based process with regular rebalancing.

ESG / Environmental Social Governance 
										



Environmental Social Governance

Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) is a commonly used phrase that describes the integration of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) criteria with financial standards when making investment decisions. Miller/Howard Investments Inc. believes, as do many others, that this integrated approach provides a framework for achieving better long-term investment returns while building sustainable global economies and markets.  Our first SRI strategy ("Better than Bonds", now Miller/Howard Infrastructure) debuted in 1991, giving us more than 25 years of experience unique among many asset managers.
		

We engage in rigorous analysis of companies using ESG criteria, establishing and maintaining individual company profiles both before and after investment.
		

Our initial, pre-investment ESG research involves an extensive process that utilizes exclusion and preference screens as well as case-by-case analysis. A company must pass this evaluation in order to be eligible for investment in our SRI portfolios. We view this layer of due diligence as an essential SRI risk-control measure.
		

Our second stage of research is conducted on all SRI holdings quarterly: We update the company profiles, looking for best practices on ESG markers (e.g. ethical, transparent governance and established principles of environmental stewardship). We use these profiles to monitor company progress on the markers, and to identify opportunities for commendation and engagement.
		
 
Our shareholder advocacy program is multi-faceted and goes beyond the profiling of companies: We participate in shareholder activism, carefully vote proxies, regularly publish a shareholder advocacy newsletter, and support organizations or managers leading shareholder resolutions whenever in alignment with our portfolio holdings and policies. (See our Proxy Policy, which explains how a client can obtain the voting history.)

Fund Risks
		The market price of equity securities may be affected by financial market, industry, or issuer-specific events. Focus on a particular style or on small or medium-sized companies may enhance that risk.
The Miller/Howard High Income Equity Fund is a closed-end fund traded on the New York Exchange (Symbol HIE). Shares must be purchased through a professional financial advisor.

There is no guarantee that the portfolio will meet its objective.

Shares of closed-end investment companies such as the Fund may trade in the market above, at, or below net asset value. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the
risk that the Fund’s net asset value could decline. The Fund is not able to predict whether its shares will trade above, below, or at net asset value in the future.

Leverage Risk. The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested magnifies both the favorable and
unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss.

Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The prospectus contains this and additional information regarding the Fund. To obtain a prospectus, please download from this site or call 1-844-MHFUNDS. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.


An investment in the Miller/Howard Funds is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Funds risks also include, but are not limited to, the following:

	
			Companies that issue dividend yielding equity securities are not required to continue to pay dividends on such stock. The Funds may be exposed to liquidity risk that effect the Funds' ability to sell particular securities or close call option positions at an advantageous price or in a timely manner. The Funds invest in small and medium size companies, which carry greater risk than with larger, more established companies.
		
	
			MLP entities are typically focused in the energy, natural resources and real estate sectors of the economy. A downturn in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors of the economy could have an adverse impact on the Fund. Changes to current tax law and regulations could affect the treatment of distributions, including (but limited to) ordinary income, capital gains or return of contribution. The Funds are new with limited operating history and there can be no assurance that the Funds will grow to or maintain an economically viable size.		
		
	
			An investment in the Miller/Howard Income-Equity Fund is also subject to the following: Non-US markets may be smaller, less liquid and more volatile than the major markets in the United States and, as a result, Fund share values may be more volatile. Trading in non-US markets typically involves higher expense than trading in the United States. The Fund may have difficulties enforcing its legal or contractual rights in a foreign country. These additional risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in emerging market countries.
		
	
			An investment in the Miller/Howard Drill Bit to Burner Tip® Fund is subject to the following: The Fund's focus on the securities that are the beneficiaries of the North American energy value chain presents more risk than if it were more broadly diversified over additional industries and sectors of the economy. General problems of energy companies include volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels, international politics, terrorist attacks, reserve and depletion risk and reduced demand.

Morningstar® Sustainability Rating™ 

	
				The Morningstar® Sustainability Rating™ is intended to measure how well the issuing companies of the securities within a fund's portfolio are managing their environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") risks and opportunities relative to the fund's Morningstar® category peers. The Morningstar Sustainability Rating™ calculation is a two-step process. First, each fund with at least 50% of assets covered by a company-level ESG score from Sustainalytics8 receives a Morningstar Portfolio Sustainability Score.™
			
	
				The Morningstar® Portfolio Sustainability Score™ is an asset-weighted average of normalized company-level ESG scores with deductions made for controversial incidents by the issuing companies, such as environmental accidents, fraud, or discriminatory behavior.
			
	
				The Morningstar® Sustainability Rating™ is then assigned to all scored funds within Morningstar® Categories in which at least ten (10) funds receive a Portfolio Sustainability Score and is determined by each fund's rank within the following distribution:




High (highest 10%)
Above Average (next 22.5%)




Average (next 35%)
Below Average (next 22.5%) and




Low (lowest 10%)




	
				The Morningstar Sustainability Rating™ is depicted by globe icons where High equals 5 globes and Low equals 1 globe.
			
	
				A Sustainability Rating is assigned to any fund that has more than half of its underlying assets rated by Sustainalytics and is within a Morningstar Category with at least 10 scored funds; therefore, the rating it is not limited to funds with explicit sustainable or responsible investment mandates. Morningstar updates its Sustainability Ratings monthly. Portfolios receive a Morningstar Portfolio Sustainability Score and Sustainability Rating one month and six business days after their reported as-of date based on the most recent portfolio. As part of the evaluation process, Morningstar uses Sustainalytics' ESG scores from the same month as the portfolio as-of date.
			
	
				Please visit http://corporate1.morningstar.com/SustainableInvesting/ for more detailed information about the Morningstar Sustainability Rating™ and its calculation. 
			

Sustainability Score and Sustainability Rating as of March 31, 2017. Sustainalytics provides company-level analysis used in the calculation of Morningstar's® Sustainability Score. Sustainability Mandate information is derived from the fund prospectus.

Strategies / Strategy Summary 
										



Miller/Howard Investment Strategies


 





Income-Equity Strategies






There are two versions of the strategy:




Income-Equity Strategy with exchange-traded Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).
								

Income-Equity Strategy (No MLPs), which does not generate K-1 tax forms from MLPs.
								

 

Key features:




A multi-cap core portfolio of high-quality stocks
							focused on high current dividend income and dividend growth, composed of reliable companies from across the broad market.
								

Conservative stocks (average debt rating above investment grade) that are high yield and projected to have a rising stream of income.
								

Solid total returns that provide both income and growth, high current income that increases every year, and a lower federal tax rate on qualified dividends.							
								

 
 

 
 

MLP Strategy







A mid-large-cap portfolio primarily composed of high-quality pipelines and energy facilities with high annual distributions that we project will have strong prospects for growth of distributions. 
								

The portfolio comprises Master Limited Partnerships with long-life assets and projects as well as durable and stable business models that can generate substantial cash flow to provide attractive yields for the investor while allowing for long-term organic growth.
								Read more about the MLP Strategy.
								

 
 

 
 

Miller/Howard Infrastructure







A mid-large-cap portfolio of energy and utilities focusing on opportunities in the broad utilities sector: electric, gas, telephone, sanitation, water, and the suppliers that enable their transmission, operation, and growth.


Focused on opportunities in the broad, global utilities industry, this portfolio seeks to participate in the dynamic growth potential of the most important economic sector (essential services and infrastructure, worldwide).
								Read more about Miller/Howard Infrastructure.
							

 
 

 
 

Miller/Howard Utilities Plus







A mid-cap, opportunistic portfolio focused on distribution gas and electric utility companies that we believe are likely acquisition candidates.
							

Companies are conservative, largely regulated, old-style rate-of-return monopolies that pay and steadily grow dividends.
						Read more about Miller/Howard Utilities Plus.
							

 
 

 
 

Rising Dividend Plus







A large-cap core strategy invested in established and seasoned companies with high financial strength and high projected dividend growth.
							

Companies considered likely to provide steadily growing earnings and dividends. This fundamentally driven strategy utilizes momentum and technical analysis in the investment process.
						
Read more about Rising Dividend Plus.
							

 
 

 
 

High-Yield Equity







A high-yield equity portfolio invested in companies that have among the highest dividends in the market.
							

We created this strategy to produce the highest possible income from stocks with reasonable safety and without securities that generate K-1 reports. We expect stocks in this portfolio to continue to pay, and potentially raise, their dividends.					
							

Strategy is diversified by industry, quality, and financial strength.
					Read more about High-Yield Equity.					
							

 
 

 
 

Drill Bit to Burner Tip®







A single-themed, balanced equity strategy that takes advantage of diverse opportunities all along the natural gas value chain, including producers, processors, transporters, and users.
							

Rapid growth and expanding demand characterize this "bipartisan fuel," which is taking the place of coal as the best source of electric generation. Holdings provide steady and rising income, with numerous opportunities for capital appreciation.
						
					Read more about Drill Bit to Burner Tip®.
							

 
 

 
 

Miller/Howard General Partners Strategy







Midstream energy with No K-1s. Midstream companies are the link between energy production and energy use. This strategy invests in exchange-traded General Partners that customarily hold interests in midstream energy limited partnerships but are not subject to K-1 tax forms.
							

Above market yields with superior income growth. Master Limited Partnerships' recent distribution growth has averaged 6%–8%. But GPs have raised their distributions faster than that by virtue of an astute business structure.				
							

Stable industry with excellent future opportunities . In our view, the surge in the country's natural gas output and recent approval of new export facilities present enormous opportunities for natural gas infrastructure to meet the needs of both domestic and offshore markets in the years to come.

Firm / Our History 
										



Our History
Miller/Howard Investments Inc. was founded in 1984 as an institutional research firm providing quantitative and technical research on large-capitalization stocks to clients such as Fidelity, CIGNA, USF&G, Delta Airlines, John Templeton, George Soros, Federal Express, and many others.* In 1989, while investigating alternatives to traditional fixed-income vehicles, we conducted a landmark study of the long-term returns of utilities as an asset class. Our research revealed the income-generating, wealth-building potential of dividends over the long term. Based on these findings, we began managing our first utilities portfolio in 1991 founded on our philosophy that internal compounding (high current dividend income plus dividend growth) is the key to building long-term wealth. We hold to the adage, “slow and steady wins the race.”

Founder Lowell Miller, a leading expert on utilities, energy, and listed infrastructure as well as broad market dividend-growth companies, has been a keynote speaker and member of many industry panels, has appeared on Louis Rukeyser's Wall $treet Week and Bloomberg TV, and is regularly quoted in the national financial media. The strong investment team we have built has more than 150 years of combined investment experience.
Our evolution has been significantly influenced by the results of our utility study and the concept of a repeating-business model. In May 1997, we initiated the Income-Equity Strategy, which expands that model to nearly all sectors of the market and emphasizes stable companies that have a high current yield, rising dividend, and that may contain a hidden “growth kicker” that's not built into the stock's price.
Miller/Howard continues to evolve with development of disciplined investment strategies that provide investors with various levels of current income and dividend growth generated by companies with real assets, such as MLPs, companies that provide essential services, and broad market, dividend-focused stocks.

ESG / Environmental Social Governance 
										



Environmental Social Governance

Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) is a commonly used phrase that describes the integration of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) criteria with financial standards when making investment decisions. Miller/Howard Investments Inc. believes, as do many others, that this integrated approach provides a framework for achieving better long-term investment returns while building sustainable global economies and markets.  Our first SRI strategy ("Better than Bonds", now Miller/Howard Infrastructure) debuted in 1991, giving us more than 25 years of experience unique among many asset managers.
		

We engage in rigorous analysis of companies using ESG criteria, establishing and maintaining individual company profiles both before and after investment.
		

Our initial, pre-investment ESG research involves an extensive process that utilizes exclusion and preference screens as well as case-by-case analysis. A company must pass this evaluation in order to be eligible for investment in our SRI portfolios. We view this layer of due diligence as an essential SRI risk-control measure.
		

Our second stage of research is conducted on all SRI holdings quarterly: We update the company profiles, looking for best practices on ESG markers (e.g. ethical, transparent governance and established principles of environmental stewardship). We use these profiles to monitor company progress on the markers, and to identify opportunities for commendation and engagement.
		
 
Our shareholder advocacy program is multi-faceted and goes beyond the profiling of companies: We participate in shareholder activism, carefully vote proxies, regularly publish a shareholder advocacy newsletter, and support organizations or managers leading shareholder resolutions whenever in alignment with our portfolio holdings and policies. (See our Proxy Policy, which explains how a client can obtain the voting history.)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for

He worked in Japan for 10 years and speaks Japanese. Full Bio (PDF)Asset ManagementConsistent with our firm philosophy, this portfolio invests in financially strong companies with rising dividends. Our disciplined investment process focuses on compounding income — not style, sector, or asset allocation — which is the main driver of long-term returns. Many studies, including our own, show that dividend-paying stocks have historically outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks, and companies that increase their dividends tend to perform the best. Stock prices may fluctuate, but dividends, when paid, are always positive. And unlike bonds (with static income), equities with growth of income help protect investors from the ravages of inflation. Even a “tame” inflation rate of 2.5% can destroy almost two thirds of an investor's purchasing power over 20 years.InvestmentWealth ManagementMatt Watkins, Regional Director—Southeast, joined Miller/Howard in 2015 to represent the firm within the financial advisory community. Beginning his career in client services in 2004, Matt worked at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management in Atlanta, Ga., for more than a decade, honing his skills and experience building relationships with financial advisors, managers, and clients.

As with all investments, individuals must make their own determination whether an investment in any particular security or securities is consistent with their investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation, and their evaluation of the security. Investors should be sure to review their decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with the investor's goals. We recommend that individuals contemplating any investment consult a professional tax or financial advisor about their individual situation.Tax ServicesIncome TaxOptions on indices of securities and sectors of securities will generally be "marked-to-market" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Fund will generally recognize gain or loss on the last day of each taxable year equal to the difference between the value of the option on that date and the adjusted basis of the option. The adjusted basis of the option will consequently be increased by such gain or decreased by such loss. Any gain or loss with respect to options on indices and sectors will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss to the extent of 40% of such gain or loss and long-term capital gain or loss to the extent of 60% of such gain or loss. Because the mark-to-market rules may cause the Fund to recognize gain in advance of the receipt of cash, the Fund may be required to dispose of investments in order to meet its distribution requirements.Send to PhoneMiller-Howard Investments Inc324 Upper Byrdcliffe Rd, Woodstock, NY 12498(845) 679-9166Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailMiller-Howard Investments Inc324 Upper Byrdcliffe Rd, Woodstock, NY 12498(845) 679-9166Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

 Return to TopLearn more about Howard MillerThe Mine is the best place to shop for Howard Miller productsHoward Miller is one of the industry leaders in Table Clocks, Grandfather Clocks, Curios, and Home Bars.  Incomparable workmanship. Unsurpassed quality. A quest for perfection. It's what Howard C. Miller insisted on when he founded the company back in 1926 at the age of 21. Even then, Howard Miller understood the need to create products that would be steeped in quality and value. He expected nothing less than the best. And it was only under those strict conditions that he allowed his name to grace every clock manufactured at their sprawling facility in Zeeland, Michigan. Howard Miller was schooled in the fine art of clockmaking by his father, Herman, in the Black Forest region of Germany.

Wall clocks are available in a variety of styles, shapes and sizes. Standard wall clocks provide an easy way to keep track of time, whereas Roman numeral wall clocks can serve as a decorative piece to add some traditional style to a living room or hallway. Most wall clocks are typically round, but are also available in rectangle, hourglass, triangular and other unique shapes. Wall Mounted clocks allow an individual to read the time from anywhere in the room. The standard number wall clocks are perfect for decorating your office, with hands pointing at the exact hour and minute, you will be on time for everything. Not only are wall clocks for just reading the time, but can be a decorative statement piece in any living room. You can use it as a timer for when you are baking goods in the kitchen or as an alarm clock in your bedroom for waking up in the morning.

Mantel clocks are a particular style of timepiece that are designed to perfectly complement the mantle above a fireplace. These clocks are frequently made in a shape that incorporates a centered clock face along with symmetrical flourishes off to each side. Others feature a square wooden housing to give the clock a more substantial appearance, while still allowing it to be a small enough installation to be displayed on a narrow shelf. We offer a great selection of both of these designs of mantle clocks in beautiful cherry and oak finishes, lovely patinaed metal finishes, and a range of other styles. Shop today to find the perfect clock for your mantle.

Table clocks are a style of timepiece that is meant to be displayed on a table, rather than mounted on the wall as many clocks would be. These can make great additions to any home and offer a more compact and portable option to meet different usages. Whether you need a new alarm clock, a handy travel clock, or something simple and classic to sit atop your desk, we have a great selection of table clocks that can suit your needs. And, we offer all of these in a wide range of styles to accommodate any décor from French country to nautical. Choose from clocks made by reliable timekeeping brands including Howard Miller, Geneva Clocks, and Oregon Scientific, to find the right one for your space.
