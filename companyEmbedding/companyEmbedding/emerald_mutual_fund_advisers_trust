The performance quoted represents past performance, does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance data current to the most recent month end may be obtained at www.emeraldmutualfunds.com.
Maximum Offering Price (MOP) for Class A shares includes the Fund's maximum sales charge of 4.75%. Performance shown at NAV does not include these sales charges and would have been lower had it been taken into account.
A Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC) of 1.00% may apply to Class C shares redeemed within the first 12 months after a purchase.

The Adviser will be permitted to recover, on a class-by-class basis, expenses it has borne through the agreement described above (the "Expense Agreement") to the extent that the Fund’s expenses in later periods fall below the annual rates set forth in the Expense Agreement. The Fund will not be obligated to pay any such deferred fees and expenses more than three years after the year(s) in which the fees and expenses were incurred. The Adviser may not discontinue this waiver, prior to August 31, 2017, without the approval by the Fund’s Board of Trustees.

NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS AND BROKER-DEALERS:The Emerald Mutual Funds are making NO year-end capital gains or income dividend payments for calendar year 2016. 



Emerald Growth Fund
Objective
The Fund seeks long-term growth through capital appreciation.
Overview
The Fund invests in companies of any size and favors smaller-sized companies with market capitalizations that are equal to or less than the largest company in the Russell 2000 Index and seeks companies with perceived leadership positions and competitive advantages in niche markets.

The portfolio is diversified across industry sectors and focuses on companies that do not receive significant coverage from other institutional investors.
The team employs a 10-step research process that includes a brief company description, its competitive advantage, an assessment of management, specific growth drivers, risk, valuation metrics and its comparables and buy analysis, and culminates with the production of an internal report on each company.
The team seeks to control volatility by diversifying the Fund's portfolio among subgroups within each industry sector and seeks to minimize risk by unequally weighting the percentage ownership of portfolio companies through a comprehensive on-going risk assessment process.

NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS AND BROKER-DEALERS:The Emerald Mutual Funds are making NO year-end capital gains or income dividend payments for calendar year 2016. 



Emerald Growth Fund Principal Risks

Any of the investments made by the Fund can result in an investment loss, which may
be significant. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect
its net asset value and total return, are:
Equity Securities: The risks associated with investing in equity securities of companies
include the financial risk of selecting individual companies that do not perform as
anticipated, the risk that the stock markets in which the Fund invests may experience
periods of turbulence and instability, and the general risk that domestic and global
economies may go through periods of decline and cyclical change.
Portfolio Turnover: The Fund is generally expected to engage in frequent and active
trading of portfolio securities to achieve its investment objective. A higher turnover
rate (100% or more) will involve correspondingly greater transaction costs, which will
be borne directly by the Fund, may have an adverse impact on performance, and may
increase the potential for more taxable distributions being paid to shareholders, including
short-term capital gains that are taxed at ordinary income rates. To the extent
a Fund engages in short sales (which are not included in calculating the portfolio
turnover rate), the transaction costs incurred by a Fund are likely to be greater than
the transaction costs incurred by a mutual fund that does not take short positions and
has a similar portfolio turnover rate.
Small and Medium Capitalization Stocks: Investment in securities of smaller
companies presents greater investment risks than investing in the securities of larger
companies. These risks include greater price volatility, greater sensitivity to changing
economic conditions, and less liquidity than the securities of larger, more mature
companies.

Please see "Discussion of Principal and Non-Principal Risks" in the Fund's prospectus
for a more detailed description of the risks of investing in the Fund. It is possible to
lose money on an investment in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit
of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency.
Emerald Banking & Finance Fund Principal Risks

Any of the investments made by the Fund can result in an investment loss, which may
be significant. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect
its net asset value and total return, are:
Allocation: The Fund's investment performance depends on how its assets are allocated
and reallocated among particular underlying Emerald Funds according to the
Fund's allocation targets and ranges. Emerald Management may make less than
optimal or poor asset allocation decisions, meaning that the Fund could miss attractive
investment opportunities by underweighting markets that subsequently experience
significant returns and could lose value by overweighting markets that
subsequently experience significant declines.

Securities Issued by Other Investment Companies: The Fund may invest in
shares of other investment companies to gain exposure to a particular portion of the
market rather than purchase securities directly. Investing in the underlying funds exposes
the Fund to all the risks of the underlying funds (as detailed below), and, in
general, subjects it to a pro rata portion of the underlying funds' fees and expenses.
The Fund is exposed to the same risks as the Underlying Funds in which the Fund invests
in direct proportion to the allocation of its assets among the Underlying Funds.
The following principal risks are principal risks of the Underlying Funds which in the
aggregate also constitute principal risks of the Fund by virtue of its investment in the
Underlying Funds.
Depositary Receipts: Investments in depositary receipts involve risks similar to
those accompanying direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, there is risk
involved in investing in unsponsored depositary receipts, as there may be less information
available about the underlying issuer than there is about an issuer of sponsored
depositary receipts and the prices of unsponsored depositary receipts may be
more volatile than those of sponsored depositary receipts.
Derivatives: The market value of the derivative instruments in which the Fund may
invest, including options, futures contracts, forward currency contracts, swap agreements
and other similar instruments, may be more volatile than that of other instruments.
When investing in derivatives for hedging purposes, certain additional
transaction costs may be accrued that may reduce the Fund's performance. In addition,
there can be no assurance given that each derivative position will achieve a perfect
correlation with the security or currency against which it is being hedged, or that
a particular derivative position will be available when sought by Emerald Management
and/or the Fund's sub-advisor.
Emerging Market and Frontier Market Securities: Emerging market and frontier
market securities present greater investment risks than investing in the securities of
U.S. companies. These risks include a greater likelihood of economic, political or social
instability, less liquid and more volatile stock markets, foreign exchange controls, a
lack of government regulation and different legal systems, and immature economic
structures.
Equity Securities: The risks associated with investing in equity securities of companies
include the financial risk of selecting individual companies that do not perform as
anticipated, the risk that the stock markets in which the Fund invests may experience
periods of turbulence and instability, and the general risk that domestic and global
economies may go through periods of decline and cyclical change.
Tax: The federal income tax treatment of the complex securities in which the Fund
may invest may not be clear or may be subject to recharacterization by the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS"). It could be more difficult to comply with the tax requirements
applicable to regulated investment companies if the tax characterization of
investments or the tax treatment of the income from such investments were successfully
challenged by the IRS. Any such failure to comply with the rules applicable to
regulated investment companies could make it more difficult for the Fund itself to
comply with such rules.
Please see "Discussion of Principal and Non-Principal Risks" in the Fund's prospectus
for a more detailed description of the risks of investing in the Fund. It is possible to
lose money on an investment in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit
of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency.
Emerald Insights Fund Principal Risks
Any of the investments made by the Fund can result in an investment loss, which may be significant. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value and total return, are:
Equity Securities
The risks associated with investing in equity securities of companies include the financial risk of selecting individual companies that do not perform as anticipated, the risk that the stock markets in which the Fund invests may experience periods of turbulence and instability, and the general risk that domestic and global economies may go through periods of decline and cyclical change.
Small and Medium Capitalization Stocks
Investment in securities of small or medium-sized companies presents greater investment risks than investing in the securities of larger companies. These risks include greater price volatility, greater sensitivity to changing economic conditions, and less liquidity than the securities of larger, more mature companies.
Portfolio Turnover
The Fund is generally expected to engage in frequent and active trading of portfolio securities to achieve its investment objective. A higher turnover rate (100% or more) will involve correspondingly greater transaction costs, which will be borne directly by the Fund, may have an adverse impact on performance, and may increase the potential for more taxable distributions being paid to shareholders, including short-term capital gains that are taxed at ordinary income rates. To the extent the Fund engages in short sales (which are not included in calculating the portfolio turnover rate), the transaction costs incurred by the Fund are likely to be greater than the transaction costs incurred by a mutual fund that does not take short positions and has a similar portfolio turnover rate.
Growth Stocks
Growth-oriented stocks may be more sensitive to changes in current or expected earnings than other stocks. The market prices of companies believed to have good prospects for revenues and earnings growth tend to reflect those expectations. When it appears those expectations will not be met, the prices of these securities typically fall. In addition, if the market does not come to share the Adviser's assessment of an investment's long-term growth, the Fund may underperform other mutual funds or stock indexes. 
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is financial risk due to uncertain liquidity. An institution might lose liquidity if its credit rating falls, it experiences sudden unexpected cash outflows, or some other event causes counterparties to avoid trading with or lending to the institution. A firm is also exposed to liquidity risk if markets on which it depends are subject to loss of liquidity. Derivative based securities and privately issued mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities, which do not have a government or government-sponsored guarantee, that are subject to substantial market and credit risk may have greater liquidity risk. Less liquid securities may trade infrequently, trade at a smaller volume, and be quite volatile. This means that they may be harder to purchase or sell at a fair price or quickly enough to prevent or minimize loss.
Real Estate Securities and REITs
Real estate investment trusts or "REITs" are issuers that invest in interests in real estate, including mortgages. Investing in REITs may subject the Fund to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in the value of underlying properties and defaults by borrowers or tenants. REITs may not be diversified and are subject to heavy cash flow dependency and self-liquidation. REITs are also subject to the possibilities of failing to qualify for tax-free pass through of income under the Code, and failing to maintain their exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). REITs may have limited financial resources, trade less frequently and in a limited volume, and be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than more widely 
  held securities. 
Restricted and Illiquid Securities
Certain securities generally trade in lower volume and may be less liquid than securities of large established companies. These less liquid securities could include securities of small- and mid-sized non-U.S. companies, high-yield securities, convertible securities, unrated debt and convertible securities, securities that originate from small offerings, and foreign securities, particularly those from companies in emerging markets.  If a security is illiquid, the Fund may not be able to sell the security at a time and/or price at which the Adviser might wish to sell, which means that the Fund could lose money. In addition, the security could have the effect of decreasing the overall level of the Fund's liquidity. 
Securities Issued By Other Investment Companies
The Fund may invest in shares of other investment companies, including, but not limited to, other mutual funds, money market funds, ETFs, HOLDRs, unit investment trusts, and closed-end funds, to gain exposure to a particular portion of the market rather than purchase securities directly. Investing in another investment company exposes the Fund to all the risks of that investment company, and, in general, subjects it to a pro rata portion of the other investment company's fees and expenses.
Managed Portfolio Risk
The Adviser's investment strategies or choice of specific securities may be unsuccessful and may cause the Fund to incur losses.
Please see "What are the Principal and Non-Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund?" for a more detailed description of the risks of investing in the Fund. It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Fund. Investments in the Fund are not deposits or obligations of any bank, are not endorsed or guaranteed by any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or any other government agency.  
Emerald Small Cap Value Fund Principal Risks
Any of the investments made by the Fund can result in an investment loss, which may be significant. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value and total return, are:
Equity Securities
The risks associated with investing in equity securities of companies include the financial risk of selecting individual companies that do not perform as anticipated, the risk that the stock markets in which the Fund invests may experience periods of turbulence and instability, and the general risk that domestic and global economies may go through periods of decline and cyclical change.
Small Capitalization Stocks
Investment in securities of small or medium-sized companies presents greater investment risks than investing in the securities of larger companies. These risks include greater price volatility, greater sensitivity to changing economic conditions, and less liquidity than the securities of larger, more mature companies. The trading volume of securities of smaller companies is normally less than that of larger companies and, therefore, may disproportionately affect their market price, tending to make prices fall more in response to selling pressure than is the case with larger companies. Smaller companies may also have limited markets, product lines, or financial resources, and may lack management experience.
Foreign Securities Risk
The Fund may invest in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). ADRs are certificates evidencing ownership of shares of a foreign-based issuer held in trust by a bank or similar financial institution. They are alternatives to the direct purchase of the underlying securities in their national markets and currencies. ADRs are subject to risks similar to those associated with direct investment in foreign securities. Foreign investments can involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments. Such risks include adverse political and economic developments or social instability; the imposition of foreign withholding taxes or exchange controls; expropriation or nationalization; currency blockage (which could prevent cash from being brought back to the United States); the impact of exchange rate and foreign currency fluctuations on the market value of foreign securities; more limited availability of public information regarding security issuers; the degree of governmental supervision regarding securities markets; different accounting, auditing and financial standards; and difficulties in enforcing legal rights (particularly with regard to depository receipts in which the holders may not have the same rights as shareholders).
Value Stocks
Value investing attempts to identify companies selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Value investing is subject to the risk that a company’s intrinsic value may never be fully realized by the market or that a company judged by the Adviser to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced. 
Geographic Risk
Funds that are less diversified across countries or geographic regions are generally riskier than more geographically diversified funds. Because the Fund’s investments may be in a limited number of countries, it is more exposed to those countries’ or regions’ economic cycles, currency exchange rates, stock market valuations and political risks compared with a more geographically diversified fund.
Depositary Receipts Risk
Depositary receipts are securities issued by banks and other financial institutions that represent interests in the stocks of foreign companies. They include, but are not limited to, American Depositary Receipts, European Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts, Russian Depositary Certificates, Philippine Depositary Receipts, and Brazilian Depositary Receipts. Depositary receipts may be sponsored or unsponsored. Unsponsored depositary receipts are organized independently, without the cooperation of the issuer of the underlying securities. As a result, there may be less information available about the underlying issuer than there is about an issuer of sponsored depositary receipts and the prices may be more volatile than if such instruments were sponsored by the issuer. Investments in depositary receipts involve risks similar to those accompanying direct investments in foreign securities.

  held securities. 
Sector Risk
 Sector risk is the possibility that all stocks within the same group of industries will decline in price due to sector-specific market or economic developments. The Fund may be overweight in certain sectors at various times.
Managed Portfolio Risk
The Adviser's investment strategies or choice of specific securities may be unsuccessful and may cause the Fund to incur losses.
Non-Diversification Risk
The Fund is "non-diversified," which means that it may own larger positions in a smaller number of securities than funds that are "diversified." This means that an increase or decrease in the value of a single security likely will have a greater impact on the Fund’s net asset value and total return than a diversified fund.
Real Estate Securities and REITs
Real estate investment trusts or "REITs" are issuers that invest in interests in real estate, including mortgages. Investing in REITs may subject the Fund to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in the value of underlying properties and defaults by borrowers or tenants. REITs may not be diversified and are subject to heavy cash flow dependency and self-liquidation. REITs are also subject to the possibilities of failing to qualify for tax-free pass through of income under the Code, and failing to maintain their exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). REITs may have limited financial resources, trade less frequently and in a limited volume, and be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than more widely held securities.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution

We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote*For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds outperformed their Lipper peer-group averages. Results will vary for other time periods.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Vanguard stock funds


93% of our low-cost stock mutual funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Give your money a chance to grow over the long term
Get higher potential for investment growth



Stock mutual funds aim to provide long-term growth, unlike bond funds, which focus on income. In exchange for more growth, however, you're likely to experience more ups and downs in the value of your investment.

Increase diversification in your portfolio



A stock fund could give you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of stocks, which spreads out risk more than owning individual stocks.

Get broad exposure to the stock markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the stock portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of stocks in a single, diversified fund.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund holds more than 3,000 domestic stocks.

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund holds more than 5,500 non-U.S. stocks.

How to choose a stock fund



Here are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right Vanguard stock fund for your portfolio:

How do stock mutual funds differ from one another?



When looking for a stock fund, consider these two characteristics:

Investing style. In general, stock funds invest in value stocks, growth stocks, or a blend of the two.

Capitalization. Stock funds also choose investments based on the size, or capitalization, of a company. Companies are considered either small-, mid-, or large-cap.


See a complete list of Vanguard stock funds


Do I want domestic or international stocks?








Investing in both U.S. and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark, they can also underperform.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Should I focus on a specific industry?



You can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market, like health care, technology, or telecommunications.But remember, these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk. Sector and specialty funds should only be used to supplement an already diversified portfolio.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
	Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.
