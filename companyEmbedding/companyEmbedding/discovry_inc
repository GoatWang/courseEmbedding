Jobs at Discovry Inc
1 Job Available • Influencer Marketing for Performance Advertisers





About Discovry Inc
Influencer Marketing needs a new paradigm. This channel is traditionally unscalable, driven by custom content executions and riddled with a lack of reliability. We spent much of 2016 learning about the ecosystem; operating as an agency and working with advertisers and influencers to create custom content campaigns and integrating ourselves into the talent management / agent space. The majority does not believe this channel can become a scaled user acquisition channel. We know it can.
We’re building technology that will enable us to collect and analyze 1st party demographic and interest data from influencer channels across their social media platforms. By meshing that data with real ROI data, we are starting to create richer data profiles for Influencers and their audiences, enabling us to activate the world’s channels for games and apps on a performance basis. Our product is in early alpha currently and beta release is planned for Q1 2017.

I haven’t posted in a while but I have a great excuse. Last Fall, I started validating a new product for, well, product managers. After a thrilling few months of building a team and starting a company, last week my co-founder and I launched ProductPlan, a better way to create product […] 
 
 
A New Customer Development Adventure: ProductPlan 



 

A few weeks ago I was invited to speak at the Rincon Venture Partners Annual CEO Summit in Santa Barbara.

If you’re part of a lean startup and you’re getting your early MVP […] 
 
 
How to Price Your Product and Avoid Startup Pricing Mistakes 


 
 

Yesterday my new online video course Startup Business Models and Pricing went live at Udemy.com. I created the course because I regularly talk with startup founders and teams who are getting ready to launch and haven’t validated their pricing or business model. Oh, and Udemy also asked me to create the […] 
 
 
Is Your Product’s Pricing Leaving Money on the Table? 



 

What’s the ideal business model for a startup? I tried to answer that question as I’m developing my online course called Successful Business Models and Pricing Strategies. Here’s one of the 14 lessons with my thoughts about the characteristics of a great business model. Background: I was asked to create an […] 
 
 
What Makes a Great Startup Business Model? 


 
 

Startups with successful business models get customer lifetime value (LTV) to be greater than the cost to acquire that customer (CAC). 
 
 
The Formula for a Winning Startup Business Model 



 

This week I wrote a guest post for the team at SecureDocs about how startups know whether they are ready to invest in sales and acquisition. Some business models make it difficult to sell cost-effectively, yet I see startups pouring cash into sales at the first sign of revenue. In the […]
