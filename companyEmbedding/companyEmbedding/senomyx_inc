Quality Assurance
As a flavor supplier, quality is of the utmost importance to Senomyx.  Our flavors and flavor boosters are produced in accredited food manufacturing facilities using the highest quality ingredients. They have met the strict requirements for both Kosher and Halal certifications.

Senomyx has been certified by SCS Global Services, a worldwide recognized third-party certifying organization, under the Safe Quality Food (SQF) Level 3 Standard.
Safe Quality Food is a multi-level food safety and quality program, benchmarked to the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). SQF certification is earned by operations that have met one of the world’s most comprehensive food safety standards. Certified SQF operations maintain a documented, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)-based Integrated Food Safety and Quality Management System that can be tracked throughout the supply chain.
SQF Level 3 certification includes a comprehensive review of all food safety programs in place at Senomyx, as well as a formal validation of the quality systems in place to maintain the certification.
Achieving SQF Level 3 certification reflects the high level of commitment Senomyx has to providing its customers with flavor ingredients of superior quality and performance. This certification, along with a successful US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) audit and a California Department of Public Health (CDPH) certification as a registered food processor previously received by the company, continue to demonstrate our dedication to quality.

Senomyx is an American biotechnology company working toward developing additives to amplify certain flavors and smells in foods. The company claims to have essentially "reverse engineered" the receptors in humans that react for taste and aroma, and that they are capitalizing on these discoveries to produce chemicals that will make food taste better. Senomyx develops patented flavor enhancers by using "proprietary taste receptor-based assay systems." These receptors have been previously expressed in HEK293 cells.[1]

History[edit]
Senomyx was founded by prominent biochemist Lubert Stryer in 1999. In May 2001, Stryer returned to his professorship at Stanford University and resigned from Senomyx, but continues to be the Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board.
The company developed Substance 951, a potentiator used to amplify the sweetness of sugar in food products, thereby allowing the manufacturer to reduce the amount of sugar used.[citation needed]
Senomyx develops patented flavor enhancers by using "proprietary taste receptor-based assay systems." These receptors have been previously expressed in HEK293 cells.[1] HEK stands for human embryonic kidney cells. These cells are derived from cells that originally came from a healthy, electively aborted human fetus in the early 1970s.[2] The receptors in the assay are used to identify flavours; they are not used as flavours themselves. No human taste receptors are used as ingredients in any flavourings. Using information from the human genome sequence, Senomyx has identified hundreds of taste receptors and currently owns 113 patents on their discoveries. Senomyx collaborates with seven of the world's largest food companies to further their research and to fund development of their technology.
Products[edit]
Senomyx's products work by amplifying the intensity of flavors. Because very small amounts of the additive are used (reportedly less than one part per million) Senomyx's chemical compounds will not appear on labels, but will fall under the broad category of "artificial flavors." For the same reason, the company's chemicals have not undergone the FDA's usual safety approval process for food additives[citation needed]. Senomyx's MSG-enhancer gained the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status from the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association, an industry-funded organization, in less than 18 months, which included three months of tests on rats.
According to Senomyx's website, it "received a positive review by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, which determined that there were no safety concerns with the use of the Company's savory flavor ingredients in foods. The positive assessment by JECFA is expected to expedite regulatory approvals in a number of countries, particularly those that do not have independent regulatory approval systems."
Two of Senomyx's newest innovations include a Cool Flavor Program that seeks to enhance cooling, menthol sensations, and a Bitter Blocker Program. According to Senomyx's website, the company is collaborating with Solae, the international soy ingredients supplier, "to develop new bitter blockers that better modulate and control bitterness in certain soy-based products." Senomyx has identified the receptors in the mouth responsible for sensing bitter taste and developed a chemical additive to knock out these receptors when eaten with hydrolyzed soy protein and other soy derivatives.

Style Scores:



F Value | F Growth | D Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Sends Letter to ShareholdersBusiness WireApril 20, 2017ReblogShareTweetShare(Graphic: Business Wire)  Multimedia Gallery URLMoreSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Directors of Senomyx, Inc. (“Senomyx” or the “Company”) (SNMX), a leading company using proprietary taste science technologies to discover, develop, and commercialize novel flavor ingredients and natural high intensity sweeteners for the food, beverage, and flavor industries, today mailed a letter to shareholders in connection with the Company’s upcoming 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 11, 2017.This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170420006476/en/ The full text of the letter follows:***April 20, 2017Dear Shareholders,At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 11, 2017, you will face a critical choice that will directly impact the future of your investment in Senomyx. You must decide whether to elect the slate of highly-qualified and experienced Board nominees put forth by the Company, or the slate of nominees put forth by an activist investor group (“Concerned Shareholders and Nominees of Senomyx” or “CSNS”) that just recently purchased less than one thousandth of one percent (0.001%) or 300 shares of Senomyx stock.As we have previously stressed, we believe that your investment in the Company will be put at extreme risk should you make the decision to give complete control of the Board to a group that owns such a miniscule amount of Senomyx shares and that has not presented a plan for how its members would improve the Company and lead it forward. Additionally, we believe that the backgrounds and track records of many members of the dissident group call into question whether they have the requisite experience, skillset and independence to truly represent YOUR best interests.In order to protect your investment and ensure that Senomyx remains on a path of maximum value creation, we urge you to elect the seasoned and experienced nominees put forth by your Company.Let’s look at the facts when comparing your Company’s nominees and the dissidents:Your Board: Has articulated a clear strategic vision for the future of Senomyx and is intensely focused on executing initiatives to drive shareholder value. Secured $275 million in development funding and is committed to securing additional non-dilutive funding for key program initiatives.  Focused on opportunities to collaborate on a non-exclusive basis with leading companies as part of a broader strategy to optimize the commercial potential of products from its Natural Sweet Program.  Recently secured $18 million in R&D funding from PepsiCo in order to advance the Company’s Natural Sweet Program, and is in discussions with approximately 20 companies to collaborate and secure additional R&D funding.  Senomyx has also focused on expense reductions and implemented a restructuring in December of 2016, resulting in an annualized savings of approximately $4 million.   The Company has narrowed the focus of its sweet taste R&D efforts to the Natural Sweet Program in response to market trends.   Your Board: Has demonstrated recent positive momentum and financial results in line with current strategic initiatives. Oversaw strong year-over-year growth in the fiscal year ended 2016 and continued strong results in 2017.   Commercial revenues were up 31% and delivered high gross margins at 88%.   Achieved continued direct sales revenue growth with Q1 2017 direct sales reaching more than double the previous highest-sales quarter since the Company began its initiative to extend its reach in the marketplace.    Senomyx has demonstrated a history of discovering and advancing product candidates into the development phase.   Most recently, Senomyx advanced its lead natural high intensity sweetener, siratose, into the development phase.    While we don’t believe that the market fairly reflects the value of Senomyx stock, we are confident that our strategy will drive long-term value for shareholders. Your Board: Has the right experience to provide effective oversight at Senomyx and has adhered to principles of good corporate governance. Has necessary industry experience at companies in relevant sectors, including food and beverage, flavor and ingredient and pharmaceutical and life sciences.  Has an extensive history of director and executive leadership at both public and private companies in relevant industries.  Five Senomyx directors have served on the Board of Directors for publicly traded companies which have been acquired for over $1 billion in each sale. Your Board: Is aligned with shareholders’ best interests. Owns over 673,000 shares (2.24%) of Senomyx, demonstrating alignment with and prioritization of the best interests of shareholders.  Has been transparent about strategic initiatives at Senomyx which are aligned with the best interests of all shareholders, to create lasting value at the Company. The Dissidents: Have failed to articulate any sort of plan and have already made repeated missteps. With less than a month to go before the Annual Meeting, the dissident group has failed to share a strategic plan for the Company with shareholders. They have provided only a 215 word boiler plate statement that summarizes basic steps applicable to any company in any industry.  Own a total of 300 shares of the Company, or less than 0.001%, all of which were recently purchased in December 2016 and January 2017. We believe this demonstrates an absence of long-term knowledge and true interest in the Company.  In the original nomination notices submitted to the Company by the dissidents, they sought to nominate 11 directors, when at that time the Board only had 8 seats, demonstrating a lack of elementary knowledge about the Company’s structure and current operations.  Never reached out to Senomyx prior to submitting their nominations, failing to offer the Company a chance to work with them constructively.  It is unclear why the dissidents are participating in this contested proxy contest to gain a change in control of Senomyx despite only owning 300 shares of stock. The Dissidents: Lack relevant experience and professional networks necessary to drive value at the Company. While the dissident nominees claim that their public company board experience makes them well equipped to create value at Senomyx, they have not offered evidence that they actually have the relevant industry experience necessary to do so.  There is also no evidence of the dissident nominees possessing the necessary networks and relationships vital to creating future partnerships for product advancement and commercial success. The Dissidents: Have had negative impacts on other companies while serving on boards and lack independence from one another, with several nominees having served on the same boards in the past. Examples include: Group member Charles Gillman, along with Barry Igdaloff and Robert Pearse, served together on the Novation Companies (NOVCQ) board, which ultimately filed for bankruptcy.1  Mark Stolper and David Pointer served together on the ALCO Stores (ALCSQ) board, which ultimately filed for bankruptcy.2  Lee Keddie, Benjamin Large and David Pointer served together on the CompuMed (CMPD) board, a company with a current market capitalization of less than $2.5 million with cash and cash equivalents of less than $100,000 for the quarter ending December 31, 2016. 3  Lee Keddie and David Pointer were nominees on a dissident slate nominated by a fellow CSNS member in respect of the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of CUI Global, Inc. (CUI).4  Lee Keddie, Charles Gillman, Barry A. Igdaloff and Benjamin E. Large are presently nominees on a dissident slate for election as directors at Birner Dental Management Services (BDMS).5 ***Senomyx’s current Board has a strategic plan in place, with positive results that demonstrate that your Board is providing the necessary oversight to ensure that initiatives are being executed and that the Company is well positioned for future growth and success. It is critical to avoid your Company being placed in the hands of a slate with short-term interests and a lack of industry experience that is sure to put your investment at risk. Vote on the WHITE proxy card FOR all seven of the Company’s director nominees – Stephen A. Block, Esq., Mary Ann Gray, Ph.D., Michael E. Herman, John Poyhonen, Kent Snyder, Daniel E. Stebbins, and Christopher J. Twomey – at the upcoming Annual Meeting.Your vote matters and can ensure that Senomyx’s momentum is not arrested at the expense of the dissidents’ short-term interests.
