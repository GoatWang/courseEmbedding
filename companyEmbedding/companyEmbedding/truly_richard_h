Early life and education[edit]
Born November 12, 1937, in Fayette, Mississippi, Truly attended segregated schools in Fayette and Meridian, Mississippi. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1959. He was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order.
Being a member of the Navy ROTC at Georgia Tech, Truly entered the U.S. Navy, where he was ordered to flight school and was designated a Naval Aviator on October 7, 1960. His initial tour of duty was in Fighter Squadron 33 (VF-33) where he flew F-8 Crusaders aboard USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise. He made more than 300 carrier landings.
From 1963 to 1965, Truly was first a student and later an instructor at the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California.[1]

In 1965, Truly was among the first military astronauts selected to the United States Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program in Los Angeles, California. He joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in August 1969 after the cancellation of the MOL program. At NASA, he was a member of the astronaut support crew and capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for all three of the manned Skylab missions in 1973, and the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975. He was assigned to one of the two-man crews for the Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle Enterprise in 1977, and the STS-2 mission in 1981, on which he became the first man to be launched into space on his birthday. Truly served as commander of STS-8 in 1983. After STS-8, Truly left NASA to become the first commander of the Naval Space Command.[2]
Return to flight[edit]
Three weeks after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Truly returned to NASA to become NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight on February 20, 1986.[3] His primary task was to watch over the Space Shuttle's return to flight status. Along with that, he was also responsible for such long term issues as whether or not Challenger would be replaced, the role the Shuttle would play in the future and the mixture of expendable spacecraft and the shuttle for upcoming missions. While it only took a few days to determine the technical reason for the accident, sorting out the root cause was more difficult. In the end, it took Truly and NASA's "Return to Flight" program 31 months before the Space Shuttle Discovery successfully flew on September 29, 1988 with STS-26. In March 1986, Truly noted in a memo that there were several actions NASA needed to accomplish before launching another Shuttle flight. They included "Solid Rocket Motor joint redesign, Critical Items review, and Operations and Maintenance Instructions review".[4]
Truly was named to head NASA as its eighth Administrator in May 1989. He held this position until May 1992. He was credited by Carl Sagan with interceding in an internal dispute regarding whether Voyager 1 should be commanded to take one last photograph of Earth before completing its primary mission.[5] The resulting photograph has since become known as the Pale Blue Dot photograph. He retired from the Navy as a Vice Admiral shortly before becoming NASA Administrator.
Post-NASA[edit]
After leaving NASA, Truly became Vice President and Director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute, part of the Georgia Institute of Technology, in Atlanta, Georgia.[6] He served in this role from 1992 to 1997.[7]
Then he served as Director of the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and as Executive Vice President of the MRIGlobal (formerly Midwest Research Institute) from 1997–2005.[8]
In May 2007, Retired Vice Admiral Richard Truly testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as a member of a military advisory board on the subject of the threats to U.S. national security posed by global climate change.[9]
In 2010, Truly was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Colorado School of Mines by Governor Bill Ritter.[10] He is currently the Vice Chairman of this board. [11]
Truly is married and has three children.
Decorations[edit]
Truly was awarded the following military decorations and government awards:[1][2]

Legion of Merit
with one star
Distinguished Flying Cross


Meritorious Service Medal

In 1988, he was awarded the Society of Experimental Test Pilots James H. Doolittle Award. He also received that year the Collier Trophy for his role in assisting NASA's return to launching manned missions after the Challenger disaster.[12]

He was assigned to one of the two-man crews for the Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle Enterprise in 1977, and the STS-2 mission in 1981, on which he became the first man to be launched into space on his birthday. Truly served as commander of STS-8 in 1983. After STS-8, Truly left NASA to become the first commander of the Naval Space Command.[2]
Return to flight[edit]
Three weeks after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Truly returned to NASA to become NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight on February 20, 1986.[3] His primary task was to watch over the Space Shuttle's return to flight status. Along with that, he was also responsible for such long term issues as whether or not Challenger would be replaced, the role the Shuttle would play in the future and the mixture of expendable spacecraft and the shuttle for upcoming missions. While it only took a few days to determine the technical reason for the accident, sorting out the root cause was more difficult. In the end, it took Truly and NASA's "Return to Flight" program 31 months before the Space Shuttle Discovery successfully flew on September 29, 1988 with STS-26. In March 1986, Truly noted in a memo that there were several actions NASA needed to accomplish before launching another Shuttle flight. They included "Solid Rocket Motor joint redesign, Critical Items review, and Operations and Maintenance Instructions review".[4]
Truly was named to head NASA as its eighth Administrator in May 1989. He held this position until May 1992. He was credited by Carl Sagan with interceding in an internal dispute regarding whether Voyager 1 should be commanded to take one last photograph of Earth before completing its primary mission.[5] The resulting photograph has since become known as the Pale Blue Dot photograph. He retired from the Navy as a Vice Admiral shortly before becoming NASA Administrator.
Post-NASA[edit]
After leaving NASA, Truly became Vice President and Director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute, part of the Georgia Institute of Technology, in Atlanta, Georgia.[6] He served in this role from 1992 to 1997.[7]
Then he served as Director of the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and as Executive Vice President of the MRIGlobal (formerly Midwest Research Institute) from 1997–2005.[8]
In May 2007, Retired Vice Admiral Richard Truly testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as a member of a military advisory board on the subject of the threats to U.S. national security posed by global climate change.[9]
In 2010, Truly was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Colorado School of Mines by Governor Bill Ritter.[10] He is currently the Vice Chairman of this board. [11]
Truly is married and has three children.
Decorations[edit]
Truly was awarded the following military decorations and government awards:[1][2]


















































Defense Distinguished Service Medal



Defense Superior Service Medal
Legion of Merit
with one star
Distinguished Flying Cross


Meritorious Service Medal
Presidential Citizens Medal
NASA Distinguished Service Medal

In 1988, he was awarded the Society of Experimental Test Pilots James H. Doolittle Award. He also received that year the Collier Trophy for his role in assisting NASA's return to launching manned missions after the Challenger disaster.[12]

Astronaut Richard H Truly,
(Vice Admiral, USN, Ret.)
Richard Harrison Truly
Richard Harrison Truly (born November 12, 1937) is
a retired Vice Admiral in the United States Navy, Naval Aviator, former
astronaut, and was the eighth Administrator of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) from 1989 to 1992. He was the first former
astronaut to head the space agency.
Early Life
Born in Fayette, Mississippi, Truly attended schools
in Fayette and Meridian, Mississippi, receiving a bachelor of aeronautical
engineering degree from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1959. Truly
was ordered to flight school and was designated a Naval Aviator on October
7, 1960. His initial tour of duty was in Fighter Squadron 33 where he flew
F-8 Crusaders aboard USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise) and made more than
300 carrier landings.
From 1963 to 1965, he was first a student and later
an instructor at the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at
Edwards Air Force Base, California.
NASA Career
1965-1986
In 1965, Truly was among the first military astronauts
selected to the USAF Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) program in Los Angeles,
California. He became an astronaut for NASA in August 1969, after the cancellation
of the MOL project. He was a member of the astronaut support crew and capsule
communicator (CAPCOM) for all three of the manned Skylab missions in 1973,
and the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975. He was assigned to one of the two-man
crews for the Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle Enterprise
in 1977, and the STS-2 mission in 1981. Truly served as commander of STS-8
in 1983. After STS-8, Truly left NASA to become the first commander of
the Naval Space Command.
Return to Flight
Three weeks after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster,
Truly returned to NASA to became NASA's Associate Administrator for Space
Flight on February 20, 1986. His primary task was to watch over the space
shuttle's return to flying status. Along with that, he was also responsible
for such long term issues as whether or not the Challenger would be replaced,
the role the shuttle would play in the future and the mixture of expendable
spacecraft and the shuttle for upcoming missions. While it only took a
few days to determine the technical reason for the accident, sorting out
the root cause was more difficult. In the end, it took Truly and NASA's
"return to flight" program 31 months before the space shuttle Discovery
successfully flew on September 29, 1988 with STS-26. In March 1986, Truly
noted in a memo that there were several actions NASA needed to accomplish
before launching another shuttle. They included "Solid Rocket Motor joint
redesign, Critical Items review, and Operations and Maintenance Instructions
review".
Truly was named to head NASA as its eighth administrator
in May 1989. He held this position until May 1992. He retired from the
Navy as a vice admiral shortly before becoming NASA administrator.
Post-NASA
fter leaving NASA, Adm. Truly became Vice President
and Director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute, part of the Georgia
Institute of Technology, in Atlanta, Georgia. He served in this role from
1992 - 1997. Then he served as Director of the Department of Energy's National
Renewable Energy Laboratory and as Executive Vice President of Midwest
Research Institute from 1997-2005. 
In May 2007, Retired Vice Admiral Richard Truly testified
before the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as a member of a military
advisory board on the subject of the threats to U.S. national security
posed by global climate change. Truly is married and has three children.
Decorations
His decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service
Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, two Legions of Merit, Distinguished
Flying Cross, and the Meritorious Service Medal. His NASA awards include
the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, two NASA Space Flight Medals, and
two NASA Exceptional Service Medals.
In 1988, he was awarded the Society of Experimental
Test Pilots James H. Doolittle Award. He also received that year the Collier
Trophy for his role in assisting NASA's return to launching manned missions
after the Challenger disaster. In January 1989, Truly was presented the
Presidential Citizen's Medal by President Ronald Reagan.

SPACE COMMAND


Dahlgren, Virginia was selected as the site
of the new Naval Space Command headquarters because the Naval Space Surveillance
System activity was already located there. Plus, it met the new command's
requirements with minimal changes. The necessary communications links to
other space related command centers were already in place. When Commodore
Richard H. Truly became the first commander of Naval Space Command, he
stated that the command's mission was to operate space systems,
not develop nor acquire new systems

Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975. He was
assigned to one of the two-man crews for the Approach and Landing Tests
of the Space Shuttle Enterprise in
1977, and the STS-2 mission in
1981. Truly served as commander of STS-8 in 1983. After STS-8, Truly left NASA to
become the first commander of the Naval Space Command.[2]
Return to
flight
Three weeks after the Space Shuttle Challenger
disaster, Truly returned to NASA to became NASA's Associate
Administrator for Space Flight on February 20, 1986.[3] His
primary task was to watch over the space shuttle's return to flying
status. Along with that, he was also responsible for such long term
issues as whether or not the Challenger would be replaced, the role
the shuttle would play in the future and the mixture of expendable
spacecraft and the shuttle for upcoming missions. While it only
took a few days to determine the technical reason for the accident,
sorting out the root cause was more difficult. In the end, it took
Truly and NASA's "return to flight" program 31 months before the
space shuttle Discovery successfully
flew on September 29, 1988 with STS-26. In March 1986, Truly noted in a memo
that there were several actions NASA needed to accomplish before
launching another shuttle. They included "Solid Rocket Motor joint
redesign, Critical Items review, and Operations and Maintenance
Instructions review".[4]
Truly was named to head NASA as its eighth administrator in May 1989. He held this
position until May 1992. He retired from the Navy as a vice admiral
shortly before becoming NASA administrator.
Post-NASA
After leaving NASA, Adm. Truly became Vice President and
Director of the Georgia Tech Research
Institute, part of the Georgia Institute of
Technology, in Atlanta, Georgia.
[5] He
served in this role from 1992 - 1997. Then he served as Director of
the Department of
Energy's National Renewable
Energy Laboratory and as Executive Vice President of Midwest Research Institute
from 1997-2005. [6]
In May 2007, Retired Vice Admiral Richard Truly testified before
the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as a member
of a military advisory board on the subject of the threats to U.S.
national security posed by global climate change. [7]
Truly is married and has three children.
Decorations
His decorations include the Defense Distinguished
Service Medal, Defense Superior Service
Medal, two Legions of Merit, Distinguished
Flying Cross, and the Meritorious
Service Medal. His NASA awards include the NASA Distinguished Service
Medal, two NASA Space Flight Medals, and
two NASA Exceptional Service
Medals.

  Distinguished
Flying Cross
  Meritorious
Service Medal
  NASA Distinguished Service

In 1988, he was awarded the Society of Experimental
Test Pilots James H. Doolittle Award. He
also received that year the Collier Trophy for his role in assisting
NASA's return to launching manned missions after the Challenger
disaster.[8] In
January 1989, Truly was presented the Presidential Citizen's Medal
by President Ronald
Reagan.

In 1965, Truly was among the first military astronauts selected to the United States Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program in Los Angeles, California. He joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in August 1969 after the cancellation of the MOL program. At NASA, he was a member of the astronaut support crew and capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for all three of the manned Skylab missions in 1973, and the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975. He was assigned to one of the two-man crews for the Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle Enterprise in 1977, and the STS-2 mission in 1981, on which he became the first man to be launched into space on his birthday. Truly served as commander of STS-8 in 1983. After STS-8, Truly left NASA to become the first commander of the Naval Space Command.[2]
Return to flight[edit]
Three weeks after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Truly returned to NASA to become NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight on February 20, 1986.[3] His primary task was to watch over the Space Shuttle's return to flight status. Along with that, he was also responsible for such long term issues as whether or not Challenger would be replaced, the role the Shuttle would play in the future and the mixture of expendable spacecraft and the shuttle for upcoming missions.

In March 1986, Truly noted in a memo that there were several actions NASA needed to accomplish before launching another Shuttle flight. They included "Solid Rocket Motor joint redesign, Critical Items review, and Operations and Maintenance Instructions review".[4]
Truly was named to head NASA as its eighth Administrator in May 1989. He held this position until May 1992. He was credited by Carl Sagan with interceding in an internal dispute regarding whether Voyager 1 should be commanded to take one last photograph of Earth before completing its primary mission.[5] The resulting photograph has since become known as the Pale Blue Dot photograph. He retired from the Navy as a Vice Admiral shortly before becoming NASA Administrator.
Post-NASA[edit]
After leaving NASA, Truly became Vice President and Director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute, part of the Georgia Institute of Technology, in Atlanta, Georgia.[6] He served in this role from 1992 to 1997.[7]
Then he served as Director of the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and as Executive Vice President of the MRIGlobal (formerly Midwest Research Institute) from 1997–2005.[8]
In May 2007, Retired Vice Admiral Richard Truly testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as a member of a military advisory board on the subject of the threats to U.S. national security posed by global climate change.[9]
In 2010, Truly was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Colorado School of Mines by Governor Bill Ritter.[10] He is currently the Vice Chairman of this board. [11]
Truly is married and has three children.

Early life and education[edit]
Born November 12, 1937, in Fayette, Mississippi, Truly attended segregated schools in Fayette and Meridian, Mississippi. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1959. He was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order.
Being a member of the Navy ROTC at Georgia Tech, Truly entered the U.S. Navy, where he was ordered to flight school and was designated a Naval Aviator on October 7, 1960. His initial tour of duty was in Fighter Squadron 33 (VF-33) where he flew F-8 Crusaders aboard USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise. He made more than 300 carrier landings.
From 1963 to 1965, Truly was first a student and later an instructor at the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California.[1]

In 1965, Truly was among the first military astronauts selected to the United States Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program in Los Angeles, California. He joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in August 1969 after the cancellation of the MOL program. At NASA, he was a member of the astronaut support crew and capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for all three of the manned Skylab missions in 1973, and the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975. He was assigned to one of the two-man crews for the Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle Enterprise in 1977, and the STS-2 mission in 1981, on which he became the first man to be launched into space on his birthday. Truly served as commander of STS-8 in 1983. After STS-8, Truly left NASA to become the first commander of the Naval Space Command.[2]
Return to flight[edit]
Three weeks after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Truly returned to NASA to become NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight on February 20, 1986.[3] His primary task was to watch over the Space Shuttle's return to flight status. Along with that, he was also responsible for such long term issues as whether or not Challenger would be replaced, the role the Shuttle would play in the future and the mixture of expendable spacecraft and the shuttle for upcoming missions. While it only took a few days to determine the technical reason for the accident, sorting out the root cause was more difficult. In the end, it took Truly and NASA's "Return to Flight" program 31 months before the Space Shuttle Discovery successfully flew on September 29, 1988 with STS-26. In March 1986, Truly noted in a memo that there were several actions NASA needed to accomplish before launching another Shuttle flight. They included "Solid Rocket Motor joint redesign, Critical Items review, and Operations and Maintenance Instructions review".[4]
Truly was named to head NASA as its eighth Administrator in May 1989. He held this position until May 1992. He was credited by Carl Sagan with interceding in an internal dispute regarding whether Voyager 1 should be commanded to take one last photograph of Earth before completing its primary mission.[5] The resulting photograph has since become known as the Pale Blue Dot photograph. He retired from the Navy as a Vice Admiral shortly before becoming NASA Administrator.
Post-NASA[edit]
After leaving NASA, Truly became Vice President and Director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute, part of the Georgia Institute of Technology, in Atlanta, Georgia.[6] He served in this role from 1992 to 1997.[7]
Then he served as Director of the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and as Executive Vice President of the MRIGlobal (formerly Midwest Research Institute) from 1997–2005.[8]
In May 2007, Retired Vice Admiral Richard Truly testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as a member of a military advisory board on the subject of the threats to U.S. national security posed by global climate change.[9]
In 2010, Truly was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Colorado School of Mines by Governor Bill Ritter.[10] He is currently the Vice Chairman of this board. [11]
Truly is married and has three children.
Decorations[edit]
Truly was awarded the following military decorations and government awards:[1][2]

Legion of Merit

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
