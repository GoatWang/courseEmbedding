What role can TIPS play in a client’s portfolio?
For investors of all ages, a fixed-income allocation can be an important part of a diversified portfolio—this is especially true for those nearing retirement. However, as inflation increases, rising consumer prices can seriously erode purchasing power as well as the value of portfolios, putting investors at serious risk of not meeting their long-term goals.

Information found on this site is directed to U.S. Investors. Important DisclosuresAll investments involve risk including the loss of principal. Investing in a single-sector mutual fund involves greater risk and potential reward than investing in a more diversified fund. By concentrating on a small number of holdings, the fund carries greater risk because each investment has a greater effect on the fund’s overall performance. The return of principal in bond funds is not guaranteed. Bond funds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the fund. Generally, the value of a bond fund rises when interest rates fall and falls when interest rates rise.General ETF Risk. The cost to a shareholder of investing in the Fund may be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETF shares and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in equities. You will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the ETFs in addition to the Fund’s direct fees and expenses.Foreign Securities Risk. International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or smaller capital markets.Quantitative Investment Strategies Risk. Manifold Partners may rely on quantitative models (both proprietary models developed by Manifold Partners and those supplied by third parties) and information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”) in managing the Fund. Models and Data are used to assist in determining investments and to provide risk management insights.Models and Data may prove to be incorrect or incomplete. In such cases, any decisions made in reliance thereon can expose the Fund to potential risks. Some of the models used by Manifold Partners are predictive in nature. Predictive models generally depend on the assumption that the future performance of a specific investment can be predicted based on the correlation of the past performance of the investment with the past performance of other investments or economic or financial data. The use of predictive models presents inherent risks. Because predictive models are usually constructed based on historical data supplied by third parties, the success of relying on such models may depend heavily on the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical data. Additionally, market dynamics change over time and correlations that existed in the past may diminish or end. A model may fail to provide correct predictions, and a model that has been successful in the past may be less successful or ineffective in the future. Most statistical formulae cannot fully match the complexity of the financial markets and a model may be flawed or may not work as anticipated. During unforeseen or low probability scenarios, models may produce unexpected results, which may result in losses for the Fund.Equity Securities Risk. In general, prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities. The prices of equity securities fluctuate, and sometimes widely fluctuate, in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer, including general market, economic and political conditions.For a complete list of fund risks, please see the prospectuses.For more complete information on the American Independence Funds, you can obtain a prospectus containing complete information for the Funds by calling 866.410.2006 or by downloading them from this web site. You should consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before you invest or send money. Information about these and other important subjects is in the Funds’ prospectus. The prospectus and, if available, the summary prospectus, should be read carefully before investing.Shares of the American Independence Funds are distributed by Matrix 360 Distributors, LLC, which is not affiliated with Manifold Fund Advisors, LLC or Manifold Partners, LLC.NOT FDIC INSURED. MAY LOSE VALUE. NO BANK GUARANTEE.Manifold Fund Advisors, LLC is a limited liability company.

Information found on this site is directed to U.S. Investors.
All investments involve risk including the loss of principal. Investing in a single-sector mutual fund involves greater risk and potential reward than investing in a more diversified fund. By concentrating on a small number of holdings, the fund carries greater risk because each investment has a greater effect on the fund’s overall performance. The return of principal in bond funds is not guaranteed. Bond funds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the fund. Generally, the value of a bond fund rises when interest rates fall and falls when interest rates rise. 
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of a Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Portfolio diversification and active risk management do not assure a profit or protect against losses in a declining market. 
Investing in the Funds involves risk. Equity securities are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments. The Funds may invest in small and mid-cap securities which are more volatile than large cap stocks. Value-based investments are subject to the risk that the broad market may not recognize their intrinsic value. Investments in fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risks. The principal value of a bond falls when interest rates rise and rises when interest rates fall. During periods of rising interest rates, the value of a bond investment is at greater risk than during periods of stable or falling rates.
General ETF Risk. The cost to a shareholder of investing in the Fund may be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETF shares and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in equities. You will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the ETFs in addition to the Fund’s direct fees and expenses.
Foreign Securities Risk. International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or smaller capital markets.
Quantitative Investment Strategies Risk. Manifold Partners may rely on quantitative models (both proprietary models developed by Manifold Partners and those supplied by third parties) and information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”) in managing the Fund. Models and Data are used to assist in determining investments and to provide risk management insights.
Models and Data may prove to be incorrect or incomplete. In such cases, any decisions made in reliance thereon can expose the Fund to potential risks. Some of the models used by Manifold Partners are predictive in nature. Predictive models generally depend on the assumption that the future performance of a specific investment can be predicted based on the correlation of the past performance of the investment with the past performance of other investments or economic or financial data. The use of predictive models presents inherent risks. Because predictive models are usually constructed based on historical data supplied by third parties, the success of relying on such models may depend heavily on the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical data. Additionally, market dynamics change over time and correlations that existed in the past may diminish or end. A model may fail to provide correct predictions, and a model that has been successful in the past may be less successful or ineffective in the future. Most statistical formulae cannot fully match the complexity of the financial markets and a model may be flawed or may not work as anticipated. During unforeseen or low probability scenarios, models may produce unexpected results, which may result in losses for the Fund. 
Tracking Error Risk. ETFs typically trade on securities exchanges and their shares may, at times, trade at a premium or discount to their net asset values. In addition, an ETF may not replicate exactly the performance of the benchmark index it seeks to track for a number of reasons, including transaction costs incurred by the ETF, the temporary unavailability of certain index securities in the secondary market or discrepancies between the ETF and the index with respect to the weighting of securities or the number of securities held.
Emerging Markets Risk. The Fund may invest in foreign securities that may include securities of companies located in developing or emerging markets, which entail additional risks, including: less social, political and economic stability; smaller securities markets and lower trading volume, which may result in less liquidity and greater price volatility; national policies that may restrict securities investment opportunities, including restrictions on investments in issuers or industries, or expropriation or confiscation of assets or property; and less developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment.
Commodities Risk. Investments in commodities, such as gold, or in commodity-linked instruments, will subject the Global Tactical Allocation Fund's portfolio to volatility that may also deviate from price movements in equity and fixed income securities.
Equity Securities Risk. In general, prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities. The prices of equity securities fluctuate, and sometimes widely fluctuate, in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer, including general market, economic and political conditions.
For a complete list of fund risks, please see the prospectuses.

The undersigned certifies that he or she has acted independently and
impartially and to the best of his or her knowledge has no known conflict in
serving as Panelist in this proceeding.
 
Houston Putnam Lowry, Chartered
Arbitrator, as Panelist.
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Complainant submitted a Complaint to the National Arbitration Forum
electronically on July 6, 2010.

            Complainant
intends to use one or more variations of the NestEgg mark for advisory
financial services.
 
            FACTUAL
AND LEGAL GROUNDS
 
            This
Complaint is based on the following factual and legal grounds:
 
            (a.)       The
Domain Name Infringes Complainants’ Service Marks.
 
The
dominant portion of the domain name in use by Respondent is identical or
confusingly similar to the dominant portion of the USPTO-registered service
marks of the Complainants.  Respondent
has no rights or legitimate interests in the Domain Name or the mark of which
the Domain Name is composed.  In
violation of federal Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051 et seq. and other
applicable federal and state law, and the common law, the domain name that
Respondent registered, nesteggadvisors.net, is intentionally identical
and confusingly similar to Complainants’ senior USPTO-registered marks: (1)
in the use of the identical compound word NestEgg or Nestegg, which joins the
two separate words, “Nest” and “Egg,” without intervening space; (2)
because the identical word directly precedes a generic term used in financial
services industries, namely, “Advisors,” and (3) thereby falsely associating the name with those so identified with
the financial services trade channels of first Complainant, who is
headquartered in the same regional market, and of both Complainants, who are in
the same web market as Respondent. 
Respondent has also adopted the identical mark as a trade name and is
using that trade name in the website associated with the Domain Name.
 
            Respondent’s Domain Name is so readily identifiable and
competitive with the family of ten marks of both Complainants as to create
immediate likelihood of confusion with and falsely attributable origin and
misidentification of Respondent’s services as those of Complainants, or as
associated with Complainants.  When marks
are so close, likelihood of confusion may result even if the goods or services
are not competitive or intrinsically related, as they are here.  In re
Shell Oil Company, 992 F.2d 1204, 1207 (Fed. Cir. 1993).
 
            (b)        Respondent
Has No Legitimate Interest in the Service Marks.
 
Respondent
has no rights or legitimate interests in the use of Nestegg in the Domain
Name.  Its usage is a recent encroachment
on the rights that Complainants’ well-established financial companies have
preserved and defended over two decades. 
Seven of Complainants’ ten USPTO marks have been in continuous use in
commerce since 1990.  All but one were in
use and registered prior to Respondent’s claimed first use in 2006 and its
domain name registration in 2005, apparently before Respondent’s claimed use in commerce.  Respondent
has neither common law nor statutory rights in the NestEgg mark.  For a decade and half prior to that Domain
Name registration, Complainants’ marks were listed, active, and widely
known for investment funds and advisory services in the financial industry.
 
From inception to February 24, 2010, the
total investment of participants enrolled in plans administered by Complainant
B and its affiliates under the NestEgg marks reached in excess of $14 million
in the States of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey alone.  During that same period, Complainant B and
its affiliates enrolled participants in NestEgg-branded mutual funds for an
investment of greater than $2 million in those states alone.  Since the assignment of the NestEgg marks in
2002, the total tangible assets in the four NestEgg Funds 2010, 2020, 2030 and
2040 alone exceeded $116 million.  
 
            Although other marks using or incorporating the words
“Nest” and “Egg” are registered in numerous international classes, a search of
the USPTO registry for the compound form at issue here, “NestEgg” in IC 36,
produces seventeen (17) records, ten (10) USPTO-classified as LIVE.  Eight
(8) of these LIVE marks are registered to the first Complainant; two (2) are
registered to the second Complainant.  
 
            The nature of Complainants’ businesses, financial
services to the public, under the NestEgg marks, requires the highest degree of
trust by the investing public.  For this
reason, Complainants strive to maintain the highest reputation for their services
under their marks and to supervise and control the reliability and consistency
of the use of those marks.  Any
derogation from Complainants’ standards under identical NestEgg usage by
another purveyor of financial services could threaten and even destroy the
carefully guarded reputation of and trust in Complainants’ family of marks,
developed since their original use in commerce in the 1990s.
 
            (c.)       Respondent
Registered and Continues Using the Domain Name in Bad Faith.
 
Respondent
registered the Domain Name using Complainants’ NestEgg mark in 2005, before
Respondent’s claimed first use in commerce. 
This domain name registration without use in commerce at that time
raises the question of whether its motivation was cybersquatting.  The Domain Name is now used by Respondent in
bad faith.  Respondent knowingly adopted
and has knowingly continued using the Domain Name and Complainants’ NestEgg
mark to misleadingly divert consumers to its website.  On April 1, 2008, claiming first use in 2006,
Respondent filed an application to register the Word Mark “NESTEGG ADVISORS”
with the USPTO in IC 36 for financial services.  This class includes, the services that Complainants’ marks define,
namely, financial planning and financial planning for retirement.  
 
            On August 5, 2008, the USPTO examining attorney for this
application issued an Office Action to Respondent denying registration of the
mark based on “Likelihood of Confusion” with several existing federal
registrations and previously-filed applications, attaching all eight registrations of Complainant
A.  See Ex. 7 at 1,
Serial No.77448857.  Complainants
incorporate herein by reference all case law cited in support of the Refusal to
Register Respondent’s proposed mark.  see also Kiki Undies Corp. v. Promenade Hosier
Mills, Inc. 411 F.2d 1097, 1100-01 (2d Cir. 1969) (continued use of mark
after receipt of USPTO Office Action finding likelihood of confusion is
tantamount to conclusive bad faith use.) 
Respondent did not contest the USPTO Office Action by the required
response date, and the USPTO entered an abandonment date of February 6, 2009
for Respondent’s application for the mark. 
 
            Notwithstanding Respondent’s actual knowledge
of Complainants’ superior rights in the NestEgg marks and likelihood of
confusion with Respondent’s use of the NestEgg Advisors name, Respondent
continued to use the mark and Domain Name. 
Respondent’s usage of this Domain Name and mark is undeniably knowing,
deliberate, bad faith usage of Complainants’ marks in the same International
Class, in violation, without limitation, of UDRP Policy, the Trademark Act, and
cybersquatting laws at U.S.C. 15 § 1125(d).
 
            In accordance with its rigorous practice in defense of
its NestEgg marks, first Complainant served a cease-and-desist letter on Respondent
on December 15, 2009.  In its reply,
Respondent failed to disclose its awareness of the existence and registration
of Complainants’ marks and refused to discontinue its usage of the Domain Name
and marks.  Complainants anticipate that
Respondent will asset that the NestEgg mark is weak, and, in support of this
position, allege that third parties are using the NestEgg mark for other
financial services.  Such assertions are
contrary to fact.  As demonstrated above,
Complainants’ marks are extremely strong given their two decades of continued
use and many millions of dollars of sales and exposure of their marks.  Furthermore, Complainant A has sent its
standard notice and demand to desist to third parties using the NestEgg mark,
including third parties previously cited by Respondent to Complainants.  Those third parties have already ceased their
infringement or are in process of changing the infringing names and marks.
 
With
knowledge of Complainants’ ownership of all “LIVE” USPTO registrations of
NestEgg marks in IC 36 for closely related services and the USPTO decision on
those specific marks, Respondent has (1) registered, trafficked in, and
used as a domain name, in web advertising and elsewhere, a valuable trademark
already decidedly distinctive at the time of Respondent’s registration of that
Domain Name, in flagrant violation of the UDRP Policy, and applicable federal
and state law; (2) refused to withdraw its usage upon awareness of
Complainants’ rights.
 
            Respondent’s unlawful use of the Domain Name and trade
name is entirely for commercial gain and for the purpose of attracting unwary
customers.  It rests on Complainants’
sound and reputable financial organizations, thereby diluting the value of
Complainants’ marks.  Respondent is in
business as a solo financial advisor. 
The likelihood is high that interested consumers would confuse the
Domain Name and the trade name use of Respondent on the website associated with
the Domain Name, through direct entry of the Domain Name or location of the
site associated with the Domain Name through internet search engines.  Continued confusion will unfortunately occur
so long as Respondent continues to use the confusingly similar domain name and
trade name in offering similar-sounding financial services.
 
 
B. Respondent
 
Preliminary Statement
Respondent received a Written Notice of Complaint and
Commencement of Administrative Proceeding on July 8, 2010.  The Notification stated that Complainant had
submitted a Complaint for decision in accordance with the Uniform Domain Name
Dispute Resolution Policy, adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN) on August 26, 1999 and approved by ICANN on October
24, 1999 (“UDRP” or “Policy”), and the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute
Resolution Policy (“Rules”), effective March 1, 2010, and the National
Arbitration Forum (“Forum”) Supplemental Rules (“Supp. Rules”), effective March
1, 2010. 
Complainants, who are an investment company and
corporation, seek to take away a domain name used by a small proprietor to run
his legitimate business.  Complainants
hope to circumvent the significant difficulties and expenses of a trademark
infringement lawsuit against Respondent with respect to its use of “NestEgg
Advisors, Inc.” as a trade name and domain name by launching this substantially
lower-cost UDRP proceeding.  In doing so,
Complainants mistake the Policy for a process to adjudicate trademark
infringement claims under United States federal law, citing case after case
interpreting federal law but not one case interpreting the Policy.  See Tea Party Patriots Inc. v.
Ulti-Media LLC, FA 1305291 (UDRP not designed to resolve trademark
disputes); Enhance Mortgage Corporation and Templeton Mortgage Corp. v.
Joseph Hayes, FA 1287900 (legal arguments under state and federal law
disregarded, because proceeding is governed by UDRP).  Aside from this failure to apply proper
caselaw under the Policy, Complainants have similarly failed to present
evidence sufficient to sustain a claim under the Policy, for Complainants
cannot escape their fatal decision in selecting a trademark that is inherently
weak and therefore entitled to a limited scope of protection.  Moreover, Respondent registered and used the
<nesteggadvisors.net> domain name (the “Domain Name”) before it had any
knowledge of Complainants or their business, thereby quashing any attempt by
Complainants to show that Respondent lacks any legitimate rights or interests
in the Domain Name or registered or used it in bad faith.  As such, it is impossible for Complainants to
establish the three elements necessary to prevail in a UDRP proceeding.  Accordingly, the Panel should deny
Complainants’ request for transfer of the Domain Name.
Response To
Factual And Legal Allegations Made in Complaint
Pursuant to Paragraph 4(a) of the Policy, Complainants
must prove each of the following elements in order to prevail in this
proceeding: (1) the Domain Name is identical or confusingly similar to a
trademark or service mark in which Complainants have rights; (2) Respondent has
no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Domain Name; and (3) the
Domain Name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.  As is more fully set forth below,
Complainants cannot establish all of those elements.
Respondent
Has Legitimate Rights or Interests in the Domain Name
Complainants cannot demonstrate that Respondent lacks
legitimate rights or interests in the Domain Name.  Respondent has done business under the trade
name “NestEgg Advisors, Inc.” since November 2006.  Based on Long Island, New York,
Respondent provides financial planning, estate planning and related services to
individual consumers located in that geographic area.  Respondent registered the Domain Name on July
28, 2005.  In December 2006, Respondent
launched the website for its business under the Domain Name.  Respondent took all of the foregoing actions
without any knowledge of Complainants’ business or their NESTEGG marks.
Given the foregoing, it is impossible for Complainants to
satisfy Paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the Policy.  Paragraph 4(c) of the Policy states that any
of the following circumstances, if found by the Panel, shall demonstrate
Respondent’s rights or legitimate interests in the Domain Name for purposes of
Paragraph 4(a)(ii): (1) before any notice to Respondent of the dispute,
Respondent used, or made demonstrable preparations to use, the Domain Name or a
name corresponding to the Domain Name in connection with a bona fide offering
of goods or services; or (2) Respondent (as an individual, business, or other
organization) has been commonly known by the Domain Name, even if Respondent
has acquired no trademark or service mark rights in the name.  Each of the foregoing is true with respect to
Respondent.
Respondent did not become aware of Complainants’ business
or their asserted rights in the NESTEGG marks until December 15, 2009, when
Complainants first sent Respondent a cease and desist letter.  Nevertheless, Complainants argue that
Respondent had at least constructive, if not actual, notice of their asserted
trademark rights on August 5, 2008.  Complainants base that claim on the Office Action that the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued to Respondent on that
date concerning its application to register NESTEGG ADVISORS, noting that the
Office Action cited some of Complainants’ registrations as possible obstacles
to registration.  Even if the Panel were
to assume that Respondent did have actual notice of Complainants’ asserted
trademark rights as of August 5, 2008, it would still remain true that, before
any notice to Respondent of this dispute, Respondent used or made demonstrable
preparations to use the Domain Name or a name corresponding to the Domain Name
in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services.  As stated above, Respondent registered the
Domain Name on July 28, 2005 and launched the website for its business under
the Domain Name on December 2006 – all well before the earliest date on which
Complainants assert that Respondent became aware of their trademark rights, and well before Respondents became aware of any
dispute between the parties.  Moreover,
since it began using the “NestEgg Advisors, Inc.” trade name in November 2006,
Respondent has been commonly known by the Domain Name.  These facts show that Respondent has legitimate
rights or interests in the Domain Name pursuant to Paragraph 4(c) of the
Policy.  See CRS Technology
Corp. v. CondeNet, Inc., FA 93547 (transfer denied where respondent made
use of <concierge.com> in connection with travel services after trademark
availability search conducted by respondent disclosed existence of
complainant’s trademark registration for CONCIERGE but before respondent
received cease and desist letter from complainant).
Respondent
Has Not Registered or Used the Domain Name in Bad Faith
Given that Respondent has legitimate rights or interests
in the Domain Name, it follows that Respondent has not registered or used the
Domain Name in bad faith, and the Panel’s consideration of this element is
unnecessary.  See MBO Partners,
Inc. v. MyBizHomepage, Inc., FA 1319466 (“Once the determination is made
that Respondent has rights to or legitimate interests in the disputed domain
name <mybizhomepage.com>, the issue of bad faith is moot and need not be
addressed by the Panel.”); Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Skunkworx Custom Cycle,
WIPO D2004-0824 (“In light of the Panel’s finding that the Respondent has
rights and legitimate interests in the disputed domain name, all issues of bad
faith use and registration under paragraph 4(a)(iii) of the Policy are now
moot.”); Vanguard Group Inc. v. Investors Fast Track, FA 863257; Leap
Real Estate Systems, LLC. v. BytePlay Limited,
WIPO Case No. D2009-1290.  Nevertheless, Respondent asserts that it did
not register or use the Domain Name in bad faith.
Respondent did not register the Domain Name primarily for
the purpose of selling it to Complainants or one of their competitors.  Respondent has not engaged in a pattern of
registering Complainants’ or any other party’s trademarks as domain names in
order to prevent such parties from reflecting their marks in corresponding
domain names.  Respondent has not
registered the Domain Name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business
of Complainants, who, in any event, are not competitors of Respondent;
Complainants offer mutual fund investment services to institutions,
intermediaries and others whereas Respondent offers financial planning, estate
planning and related services to individual consumers located in the geographic
area of Long Island, New York. 
Respondent did not register the Domain Name to free ride on the goodwill
associated with Complainants’ marks.  In
short, Respondent has not engaged in any of the examples of bad faith set forth
in Paragraph 4(b) of the Policy.
As discussed above, Respondent was not aware of
Complainants’ trademark rights before it registered and began using the Domain
Name in connection with its bona fide offering of goods and services.  But even if Respondent had registered and
began use of the Domain Name with knowledge of Complainants’ trademarks, the
fact remains that Complainants’ marks are inherently weak and any distinctive
quality they may have is highly diluted by the existence of innumerable
third-party uses of “nest egg” as a designation in connection with financial
goods or services.  Moreover, there are
several third-party registrations in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office for marks that contain the term “nest egg” and cover financial goods or
services:
BUILD AND PROTECT YOUR NEST
EGG, Reg. No. 3349931
SECURE NEST EGG, Reg. No.
3230957
NEST EGG NEWS, Reg. No.
2653937
THE NEST EGG FUND, Reg. No.
2527264
 
There are also several third-party
registrations and uses of domain names that incorporate “nest egg” in
connection with websites for financial goods or services, including, but not
limited to, the following:



<nesteggfinancialplanners.com>
<nesteggbuilders.com>
<nesteggfinancial.com>
<nestegginvestor.com>
<nestegg-solutions.com>


<nestegggameplan.com>
<nestegginfo.com>
<nesteggsoftware.com>
<nestegginvesting.com>



 
The abundance of such third-party uses and registrations
no doubt results from the generic quality of “nest egg” as used in connection
with financial goods and services, and they demonstrate that Complainants hold
no monopoly on the use of “nest egg” as a part of a service mark or trade name
for financial goods and services.  The
term in everyday use refers to money set aside for a future purpose, such as
retirement.  See definitions at http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nest+egg.  Respondent chose its trade name, “NestEgg
Advisors, Inc.,” and the Domain Name to refer to that basic dictionary
definition of the term “nest egg,” not to exploit any likelihood of confusion
with Complainants’ marks.  By choosing an
inherently weak mark, the dominant element of which is a generic term,
Complainants must accept the right of others to make legitimate use of the term
in its generic sense.  See
Lockheed Martin Corporation v. The Skunkworx Custom Cycle,
WIPO Case No. D2004-0824 (warning complainant of coming dangerously close to
engaging in reverse domain name hijacking and denying transfer because “merely
owning a trademark, whether registered or not, does not suffice, in and of
itself, as a vehicle to halt all unauthorized third-party inclusion of that
mark within a domain name”); CRS Technology Corp. v. CondeNet, Inc., FA
93547 (denying transfer because the “term ‘concierge’ is inherently weak due to
its widespread descriptive use, and therefore is entitled only to a narrow
ambit of protection”); PwC Business Trust v. Ultimate Search, WIPO Case
No: D2002-0087 (finding multiple third-party uses of the acronym “pwc” and that
“[t]his inherent lack of distinctiveness is what undermines the Complainant’s
attempts to have the Panel regard mere registration of PWC.com by the
Respondent as self evident bad faith.”); MBO Partners, Inc. v.
MyBizHomepage, Inc., FA 1319466; The Vanguard Group Inc. v. Investors
FastTrack, FA 863257.  Therefore,
Respondent has not registered or used the Domain Name in bad faith.
The
Domain Name Is Not Identical or Confusingly Similar to a Trademark or Service
Mark in Which Complainants Have Rights
The Domain Name is not identical or confusingly similar
to any of Complainants’ trademarks. 
Complainants own no trademark registration for NESTEGG ADVISORS, and all
of their trademark registrations consist of composite marks featuring the
combination of multiple words and/or a design. 
None of the registrations contain the term “nest egg” by itself, nor do
any of them contain the term “advisors.” 
As such, the Domain Name is not identical to any of Complainants’
trademarks.
Furthermore, the Domain Name is not confusingly similar
to Complainants’ trademarks.  The parties
have used their respective marks in the marketplace for nearly four years, yet
there has been no evidence whatsoever of any actual confusion.  Such an extensive period of time of
concurrent use without actual confusion confirms that no confusing similarity
exists.
As discussed above, Complainants’
marks are inherently weak and highly diluted by countless third-party uses of
and registrations for marks that incorporate “nest egg.”  Where numerous similar marks coexist, the
scope of protection to which each mark is entitled should be narrowly
construed.  See The
Knot, Inc. v. Julia Bitton, The Nest, WIPO Case No. D2006-0377
(complainant’s right to exclude others is considerably limited in scope where
its mark is descriptive of the goods and services it offers).  Given that the only component of the Domain
Name that bears any identity or similarity to Complainants’ trademark is the
generic term “nest egg,” the Domain Name is not confusingly similar to any of
Complainants’ trademarks.
 
 
C. Additional Submissions
Complainants submitted the following additional information:
 
            a.)        This Submission
Confirms that Respondent’s Domain Name Is Confusingly       Similar to Complainants’ Family of
Valuable and Famous Service Marks;    Respondent’s
Contentions to the Contrary Lack Credibility.
 
            The single source of inescapable confusion in this
proceeding is Respondent’s usage of the non-generic part of Complainants’
distinctive, suggestive mark, “NestEgg,” in Respondent’s domain name and, as
later adopted, in its unregistered trade name for financial services and
investments offered on its web site accessed through that domain name.  Thus, NestEgg is a source of web inquiries and
financial gain for Respondent from the use of Complainants’ strong family of
marks. The Response nevertheless purports to deem the mark weak because of a
relatively small group of distinguishable descriptive Nest Egg uses.
 
The distinctive, suggestive feature
of the mark at issue, however, is its combination of two words into one name, a
combination that Complainants designed and that no lexicographer has included
in a dictionary in that form.  Respondent
disregards this difference not only in the reference to a dictionary entry for
“nest egg,” but also in four USPTO registrations in the two separated words and
for uses that do not challenge Complainants’ rights. The marks BUILD AND
PROTECT YOUR NEST EGG and SECURE NEST EGG are clearly not in the form of the
domain name/mark at issue.  NEST EGG NEWS
is a Class 016 registration for children’s newsletters.  The fourth mark cited,
THE NEST EGG FUND is incontestable.  
Significantly, its owner is John Hancock Advisers, LLC, with whom
Complainants[1]
have long had a concurrent use agreement, and expressly distinguishing between
the usages of “NestEgg” and “Nest Egg” forms to avoid confusion.  
 
Complainants
are familiar with Respondent’s examples of domain name usage by others.  Complainants must and do serve
cease-and-desist letters and defend their marks, as circumstances require, to maintain their value and strength.  Users of several competing marks have
withdrawn their usage within the past year. 
In certain instances, Complainants seek remedies appropriate to the
perceived harm.  Nest Egg Financial
Planners has to date evaded Complainant A’s cease-and-desist letters by
frequent changes of office address.  Some
unwitting infringers welcome the incentive to introduce a replacement name to
the public and the consequent publicity enabled with funds saved by avoiding
legal contest.  Some such infringers
respect Complainants’ rights as prior owners, express regret for inadvertent
infringement, and make the necessary changes in good faith as promptly as
possible.
 
Tellingly,
Respondent provides no evidence of having made a bona fide mark search before
adopting the domain name or the service mark for its business.  Failure to conduct a proper trademark search
is “willful blindness to the existence of the rights of others.” Compact Disc World v.
Artistic, Inc., FA0097855 (Nat. Arb. Forum  Aug. 15, 2001).
 
            The
Response states that “Complainants are not competitors of Respondent” and that
“Complainants offer mutual fund investment services to institutions,
intermediaries and others whereas Respondent offers financial planning, estate
planning and related services to individual consumers.”  But at the bottom of its initial “NestEgg”
web page, Respondent announces investment offers:
 
            “Securities offered through American
Portfolios Financial Services, Inc.”
 
This exhibit, from which the NestEgg heading appears to have
been removed, also counsels in a “Note” in small print that “Email should not be used to enter trades.”

 
            Respondent’s
webpage belies its claim that its business is not competitive with
Complainants’.  Contrary to Respondent’s
assertion, both Complainants use business names (American Independence
Financial Services and Intrust Bank) that make clear, as their Complaint
states, they render broad financial planning services.  Similarly, most of first Complainant’s Nest
Egg marks includes “services” as uses of the
mark.  The parties to this dispute are
all engaged in financial advisory services and investment offerings under the
distinctive NestEgg mark.  Second
Complainant specifically provides investment education and counsel under its
NestEgg U and NestEgg Consulting marks. 
Through the use of the internet, the parties’ market is far beyond the
location of any office.  Respondent’s
location on Long Island has little or no
bearing on its customer base.  A
reasonable user of the internet would believe that Respondent’s site and
offerings were related to Complainants, regardless of the physical location of
the respective offices..  See
American Online, Inc.  v.
Tencent Communications Corp. (FA0093668 Mar. 21, 2000)(“ubiquitous
nature of the Internet”).   
 
Complainants’
marks have been widely used in commerce since 1999 and have acquired secondary
meaning.  Their investment services have
resulted not only in their solid growth (see
Certifications attached to Complaint), but in the concept of the name to
suggest their services.  A “nestegg”
conceptualizes and suggests an investment. 
Complainants’ services and offerings under the distinctive NestEgg marks
through the years and the expenditure of substantial sums have strengthened
their association with dependable performance and integrity.  See
Regional Hospitality WorldWide, Inc. v. Regent Plaza Hotel, FA0097262 (Nat.
Arb. Forum June 25, 2001).  (Complainant
invested substantial sums in developing and marketing, and developed
substantial good will and customer loyalty). 
 
            Adding further to the strength of Complainants’ marks, on
July 24, 2010, the Wall Street Journal published ratings by
prominent investment research firm, Morningstar, of the six leading “target
date” funds.  These funds are designed
for investors who hope to retire by a certain target date.  The article featured six such funds that
outperformed a peer index for the past three years.  Complainants’ “NestEgg series” of funds ranked fourth behind Wells Fargo’s Dow
Jones series, American Century’s Livestrong series, and Vanguard’s Retirement
series, equaled MFS Livetime series, and outranked J.P. Morgan’s Smart
Retirement series.
 
            This
recognition is both testimony to, and extension of, the consistently growing
fame of Complainants’ NestEgg marks since their first use in commerce in
1990.  The appearance of the NestEgg
series in the Wall Street Journal article emphasizes the extreme danger
that potential investors may confront. 
Searching the Internet for the distinctive and famous “NestEgg” mark to
access the NestEgg funds series and obtain related advisory services, they may
well be misled by Respondent’s confusingly similar domain name, website mark
and design, into fund transactions and advice on the assumption that there is a
responsible relationship, which does not exist, between Complainants and
Respondent. 
 
Respondent’s “Web Page” Exhibit is
further misleading in the absence of the mark that appears at the top on
the screen at that site just seconds after it is accessed at
www/nesteggadvisors.net.  A photograph of
the top three-fourths of the initial web page screen on July 30, 2010 shows the
“NestEgg” mark prominently heading
the page.  This screen contains the mark
in the identical script type
set-up as in first Complainant’s design mark, “NestEgg Funds Life
Simplified” on its USPTO Registration Record. 

 
            b.)
       The Response and This Additional
Submission Confirm That Respondent           Has
No Legitimate Interest in the Domain Name or Service Mark.
 
                Respondent
was never authorized to use the NestEgg mark. 
The mark is identical to Complainants’ registered service marks in image
and formation, usage, purposes and market. 
Even if Respondent offers investment funds and advisory services through
a third party, it can and surely does make financial gain by redirecting
inquiries about NestEgg funds to American Portfolio Financial Services, Inc., a
name not too different from that of first Complainant, American Independence
Financial Services, Inc.  Respondent also
offers financial advice through American Portfolio Advisors, Inc.   See
www.nesteggadvisors.net at 1-2 (bottom of pages).[2] 
 
            For
the NestEgg family of marks in use since 1999, Complainants filed and obtained
USPTO servicemarks for those marks beginning on August 12, 2002.  These marks included both the joined words
and the nest and egg design for NestEgg
Funds LIFE SIMPLIFIED, registered on July 12, 2005.  It should be noted that Respondent
registered the domain name on July 28, 2005.  Sixteen months later, in
December 2006, Respondent adopted the same joined words, NestEgg,
the identical lettering style, and a rotated nest and egg design.  This seems hardly coincidental, since no
other NestEgg mark of Complainants has this exact form and Respondent claims no use of the mark until long after 1999, the year
when Complainants’ marks were first in recorded use.
 
            Respondent
has refused to cease the use of the NestEgg mark as a domain name and as an
unregistered service mark.  Complainants
have therefore invoked the UDRP proceeding as the efficient process established
for the express purpose of determining the respective rights in disputes
between domain name and trademark owners in the shortest time.  This process is not in lieu of a trademark
infringement suit.  It is the shortest
route to cut off the current harm where likelihood of confusion prejudicially
exists.
 
            Respondent has objected to Complainants’
citation of federal cases (two in number) on likelihood of confusion.  Rule 15A of the Rules for Uniform Domain Name
Dispute Resolution Policy instructs the Panel “to decide a complaint on the
basis of statements and documents submitted in accordance with the Policy, the
rules and any rules and principles of law that it deems applicable.”  Surely, federal and state trademark law is
deemed applicable.  Since trademark law
offers Respondent no support, it cites only NAF and WIPO decisions, but its
citations are inapposite.  In the
following decisions as cited by Respondent, the businesses, products, services,
and/or markets of the opposing parties were found to differ:  CRS
Technology Corp. v. CondeNet, Inc., FA 0093547; MBO Partners, Inc. v.
MyBizHomepage, Inc., FA 1319466;
Lockheed Martin Corp. v Skunkworx Custom Cycle, WIPO D20003-0824; Vanguard Group Inc. v. Investors Fast Track,
FA 0863257; Leap Real Estate Systems, LLC
v. BytePlay Limited, WIPO D2009-1290 (also here, the Respondent’s search
engine use was not for commercial gain.) 
In Tea Party Patriots Inc. v.
Ulti-Media LLC, FA 1305291,  Complainant’s first use was only two
months prior to Respondent’s registration. 
In Enhance Mortgage and Templeton
Mortgage Corp. v. Joseph Hayes, FA 1287900, there was no trademark
registration and no evidence of that Complainant’s rights.
 
            In the same
industry and market as Complainants, Respondent knew or should have known of
Complainants’ registered marks and could have ascertained the status of such
marks, but failed to do so.  Respondent,
with no predating rights, had either actual and/or constructive knowledge of
Complainants’ developed goodwill and customer loyalty.
 
            Use of a
protected name that constitutes clear trademark infringement does not result in
any rights or legitimate business interest in the domain name.  Legal rights and interests cannot accrue to
Respondent by way of trademark infringement. 
Harcourt Inc. v. R &D
Glassblowing, FA0095010 (NAF July 13, 2000);  American Online, Inc. v Xianfeng Fu, D2000-1374
(WIPO Dec. 12, 2000) (apparent disregard); see
also Underground Service, Inc. v. CSS Group, LLC, FA0968403 (Nat. Arb.
Forum Apr. 27 200l) (“apparent failure to conduct a trademark search to
discover Complainant owned a federal registration … in association with
services highly related to Respondents”). 
As for Respondent’s production of the results of a current web search of
the mark, these printouts do not illustrate the use of the mark at the time
Respondent registered the domain name or activated a website using
Complainants’ mark.  Putative
infringements by others on Complainants’ protected marks do not serve as a
valid defense to Respondent’s acts nor do they affect Respondent’s rights in
this matter in any way.
 
            c.)        The
Response and This Additional Submission Confirm that Respondent Has    Registered and Continues Using the Domain
Name in Bad Faith.
 
            It is highly unlikely that Respondent, who operates in
the same financial area, has an office in New York, and wider access through the
internet, was unaware of the well-known NestEgg offerings and other operations
of Complainants until 2005.
 
            After
registering the NestEgg domain name, Respondent waited sixteen months to
use the name.  See Treeforms, Inc. v. Cayne Indus. Sales Corp. (FA0095856 Dec. 18,
2000) at 8C (Registration and Use in Bad Faith: “Given the Respondent’s
inactivity toward the contested domain name for a 15-month period and its total
lack, … of undertaking any demonstrable preparations during that time to
utilize the name in an operational web site, the Panel believes that the
Respondent registered the contested domain name in bad faith….”)  Then, without a search, Respondent adopted
the domain name (minus .net) as a service mark in which it had acquired no
prior rights.  That usage is a bad faith
infringement for failure to make a bona fide search for its availability.  It is also bad faith infringement for failure
to cease its usage after the USPTO denial of Respondent’s application for a service
mark for likelihood of confusion, issued with a full list of Complainants’ live
marks.  Respondent failed to heed
Complainants’ cease-and-desist letters with the necessary information to verify
Complainants’ senior rights.
 
            Respondent
had constructive, if not actual, knowledge of Complainants’ marks at the time
of its registration of the domain name, and certainly actual knowledge after
its adoption of NestEgg as a service mark on its website.  Respondent had the obligation to perform a
diligent search to determine whether the name might infringe on another’s
intellectual property.  See  Digi Int’l v. DDI Sys.,, FA0124506 (Nat.
Arb. Forum Oct. 24, 2002).
 
            As in Compact Disc World v. Artistic Visions, Inc., FA0097855 (Nat. Arb.
Forum, Aug. 1, 2001), through the domain name and the infringing web site mark,
“Respondent attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to
Respondent’s web site …, by creating confusion with Complainant’s mark as to
the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of Respondent’s web site
or service or investment offerings.”  Id.  Respondent either made no
effort to determine if its use of the disputed name might infringe on existing
rights or it knew of Complainants’ registered rights and deliberately
flouted them.
 
            Respondent’s initial selection and continued use of the
NestEgg mark after a USPTO finding of likelihood of confusion is conclusively
bad faith use of the domain name to attract to its web site for advisory
services and investment offers, that is, for its commercial gain, unwary consumers
that may be, or may already have been, mistaken for Complainants’ services or
offerings.  Complainants, as the far
senior and registered users, have the obligation to prevent the likelihood of
confusion and possible injurious loss to the public.  As they have served several cease-and-desist
letters upon Respondent, they have pursued and are pursuing a similar course to
defend the mark from infringement as it arises. 
In most instances, its efforts are successful, since the goal of sound
professional investors is to build a unique name with a dedicated reputation
and following.
 
            It is also
to be questioned why Respondent chose to adopt a domain name it purports to
deem “inherently weak.”  Response at 1.[3]  Yet Respondent filed a USPTO servicemark
application in 2008 with a claimed first usage of November 2, 2006.  Respondent did not use the mark in commerce
for sixteen months thereafter, according to that application. Furthermore,
Respondent chose to submit that application in a form it deems weak for USPTO registration,
through counsel, on April 1,
2008.  It is unusual for counsel to
submit an application for a mark without conducting a search for confusingly
similar marks.  In 2008 such a search
would have revealed the family of Complainants’ marks, as later supplied by the
USPTO examiner in denying Respondent’s application as confusingly similar. 
 
 
Respondent further submitted:
 
Preliminary Statement
Pursuant to Paragraph 7(c) of the Supplemental
Rules, Respondent files this Additional Submission in response to Complainants’
Additional Submission filed on August 4, 2010. 
As a preliminary matter, Respondent submits that Complainants’
Additional Submission was not timely filed in accordance with Paragraph 7(a) of
the Supplemental Rules, which requires the filing of such additional submission
“within five (5) Calendar Days after the date the Response was received by the
Forum …”  The Forum
received the Response on July 28, 2010, making Complainants’ Additional
Submission due August 2, 2010.  However,
the Forum did not receive Complainants’ Additional Submission until August 4,
2010, and Complainant offered no explanation for the late filing.  Respondent requested that the Forum strike
Complainants’ Additional Submission or, in the alternative, give Respondent the
same benefit of extra time taken by Complainants, but the Forum deferred issues
concerning Complainants’ late submission to the Panel and compelled Respondent
to file this additional submission in less time than that taken by
Complainants.  As such, Respondent
requests that the Panel strike Complainants’ Additional Submission so that they
are not permitted to benefit from their dilatory tactics.  See Commonwealth Communications
Group, Inc. v. David Lahoti dba eSecure, FA 100124 (“Because Complainant
failed to provide any justification for its untimely submission, the Panel
agrees that the submission should be disregarded.”)

Even if the Panel were to consider Complainants’
Additional Submission, the Panel should give it little or no weight.  Complainants rehash the failed arguments
stated in their Complaint and fail again to grasp the difference between a
federal trademark infringement lawsuit and the limited scope of a UDRP
proceeding.  They misapply UDRP
precedents and offer nothing more than speculation while ignoring the following
facts: (1) Respondent was not aware of Complainants or their purported
trademark rights prior to its registration of the Domain Name and use of it in
connection with a legitimate business; (2) Complainants’ inherently weak and highly
diluted mark is entitled to little protection; and (3) the foregoing facts
preclude the possibility of bad faith registration or use of the Domain Name by
Respondent and a finding that the Domain Name is identical or confusingly
similar to Complainants’ mark. 
Therefore, Complainants cannot prove the three elements necessary to
prevail under the UDRP.
Complainants Cannot Satisfy
Elements Required by the UDRP
Respondent
Has Legitimate Rights or Interests in the Domain Name
Respondent began conducting a legitimate business under
the “NestEgg Advisors, Inc.” trade name in November 2006, over three years
before Respondent became aware of the dispute that is the subject of this
proceeding.  See American
Installation Company, Inc. d/b/a NationLink Wireless v. Missouri-Wide Cellular,
FA 583008 (respondent had legitimate rights or interests in
<nationlinkwireless.com> domain name, notwithstanding complainant’s
federal registrations for NATIONLINK, because respondent conducted business
under “NationLink Wireless” trade name). 
Complainants do not dispute this, arguing instead that Respondent has
forfeited its legitimate rights or interests through its acts of
infringement.  Complainants cite a number
of cases to support that claim, but none of them are on point.  America Online, Inc. v.
Xianfeng Fu, WIPO Case No. D2000-1374, involved AOL’s mark for the famous
ICQ program, perhaps the most ubiquitous Internet chat program available before
the advent of AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icq.  In Harcourt, Inc. v. R & D
Glassblowing, FA 95010, respondent’s <sciglass.com> domain name was
identical to complainant’s distinctive SCIGLASS mark, and complainant owned a
trademark registration for SCIGLASS, not SCIGLASS followed by a number of
descriptive or generic terms.  Similarly,
in Underground Services, Inc. v CSS Group, LLC, FA 96843, respondent’s
<safedig.com> domain name was identical to complainant’s distinctive
SAFEDIG mark, and complainant owned a registration for SAFEDIG on its own,
without any other terms.
In this proceeding, Complainants do not own a distinctive,
let alone famous, mark, and the marks registered by Complainants are not
identical to the Domain Name.  Respondent
registered <nesteggadvisors.net> as its Domain
Name, not, for example, <nesteggfundslifesimplified.com>,
<nesteggcapitalpreservationfund.com> or <nesteggfund2010.com>.  Complainants, in short, claim to own a
monopoly on the term “nest egg” for goods and services in the financial
industry, such that no other provider of financial goods or services could
legitimately use it as a dominant feature in its domain name.  But the UDRP simply does not support
Complainants’ excessively expansive view. 
See, e.g., State Fair of Texas v BigTex Sports, FA
95851 (“Its argument essentially is that, because the Complainant has
registered ‘Big Tex’ as a mark, nobody can use it in any circumstance, and,
therefore, the Respondent could not possibly have a legitimate interest in any
name containing the words ‘Big Tex’.  But
I am not persuaded that the law is as simple as that.”)  In any event, a UDRP proceeding is not the
right forum to adjudicate which party has superior rights to a mark.  See American
Installation Company, Inc. d/b/a NationLink Wireless v. Missouri-Wide Cellular,
FA 583008 (“The evidence is not sufficient to
determine who has the better rights to the nationlink mark.  This will require a full evidentiary hearing
(including taking testimony and cross-examination) and is not suited to the
summary proceedings used in the UDRP.”) 
Neither UDRP precedent nor the facts support the conclusion that
Respondent lacks legitimate rights or interests in the Domain Name.
Respondent
Has Not Registered or Used the Domain Name in Bad Faith
Even if Complainants could demonstrate that Respondent
lacks legitimate rights or interests in the Domain Name, Complainants would
still be unable to prevail in this proceeding because they cannot demonstrate
that Respondent has registered or used the domain name in bad faith.  In seeking to prove this element,
Complainants’ Additional Submission introduces a different standard of
knowledge from that required by Paragraph 4(a)(iii) of
the UDRP, arguing that Respondent knew or should have known of Complainants’
mark before registering the Domain Name and that Respondent acted in bad faith
by failing to conduct a trademark search before registering the Domain
Name.  Prior panels and the April 30,
1999 Final Report of the WIPO Internet Domain Name Process (the “WIPO Report”)
make clear that a domain name registrant has no duty to conduct a trademark
search before registering a domain name. 
See FormLinc Information d/b/a GroupLink v. Credit Suisse
Group, FA 96750 (“Although Respondent acknowledges it was unaware of
Complainant’s trademark at the time it registered its domain name, it could
easily have learned of the trademark and thereby have avoided this
dispute.  Nevertheless, CSG’s failure to
verify the existence of Complainant’s trademark is not, alone, evidence of bad
faith.”); Alberto-Culver Co. v. Pritpal Singh Channa, WIPO Case No.
D2002-0757 (“I reject the idea that some sort of ‘constructive notice’ is
generated upon a trademark registration, and that this is sufficient to
establish bad faith.  To accept this idea
is to accept that a trademark registration—without anything further—is enough
to establish bad faith under the Policy. 
This is a ludicrous suggestion, and runs contrary to the clear intention
of paragraph 4.a.(iii) which was intended to protect
the interests of domain name holders who registered without bad faith.”); State
Fair of Texas v BigTex Sports, FA 95851 (declining to hold that
respondent’s failure to conduct trademark search constitutes bad faith); see
also WIPO Report at Paras. 103-105 (performance of
trademark search not prerequisite for domain name registration).
Relying on Treeforms, Inc. v. Cayne Industrial Sales,
Corp., FA 95856, Complainants then assert that Respondent’s delay in
launching a website under the Domain Name after registration suggests that
Respondent registered the Domain Name in bad faith.  But Treeforms is wholly
distinguishable from the facts here.  The
respondent in Treeforms registered the domain name and held on to it for
over 15 months without using it or making demonstrable preparations to use it
for a legitimate purpose.  In fact, the
respondent still did not have a functioning website at that domain name when
the complainant initiated the UDRP proceeding. 
Worse yet, the respondent attempted to sell the domain name to the
complainant.  Here, Respondent launched a
website under the Domain Name in December 2006 – several years before learning
about Complainants, has used it ever since in connection with its legitimate
business, and has not offered to sell the Domain Name to Complainants.
Lacking support in UDRP precedent, Complainants turn next
to delusional theories concerning the intent of Respondent to knock off their
weak and diluted mark, latching on belatedly to a perceived similarity between
the graphical representation of Respondent’s trade name on its website and
Complainants’ Registration No. 2,965,514 in the United States Patent and
Trademark Office for NESTEGG FUNDS LIFE SIMPLIFIED & Design.  It seems Complainants reach that conclusion
based in large part on the similarity of the fonts.  But that fact is entirely unremarkable, given
that the graphical representation of Respondent’s trade name is depicted in a
Lucida font – one of the most popular fonts available.  
Complainants attempt to rehabilitate the inherent weakness
of their mark as shown by the many third-party uses and registrations for marks
and domain names that feature “nest egg” by asserting that they will mount
enforcement efforts against those parties as well, just as they allegedly have
against others.  They allege that numerous
third parties have relented in their use of “nest egg” after being confronted
by Complainants.  That may be evidence of
Complainants’ successful efforts at bullying others into submission with a
superior war chest, but it is not evidence of Complainants’ superior rights.
With regard to John Hancock’s Registration No. 2,527,264
for THE NEST EGG FUND in the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
Complainants advise that the three parties have executed a coexistence
agreement concerning their various “nest egg” marks.[4]  In doing so, Complainants appear to miss the
very essence of a coexistence agreement, which is an acknowledgement amongst
the parties that no likelihood of confusion exists.  If THE NEST EGG FUND for mutual fund
investment services can peacefully coexist with Complainants’ NESTEGG mark for
identical services, then Respondents’ <nesteggadvisors.net> Domain Name
for financial advisory services can peacefully coexist with Complainants’ mark
as well.  
With regard to other third-party uses and registrations
disclosed in the Response, Complainants argue that what distinguishes their
mark from those of others is their elimination of the space between “nest” and
“egg.”  Respondent submits that the mere elimination
of a space is not novel, nor does it render an otherwise generic term
distinctive.  Furthermore, it would be
impossible for Respondent or anyone else to use a space in a domain name.  In any event, many of the third-party uses
disclosed in the Response feature “nestegg” (i.e., “nest” and “egg” combined as
a compound word), including: NESTEGG BUILDERS, NESTEGG FINANCIAL, NESTEGG
INVESTING and NESTEGG SOLUTIONS.  Given
the inherent weakness and diluted nature of Complainants’ mark, it cannot be concluded
that Respondent exhibited bad faith in its registration and use of the
<nesteggadvisors.net> Domain Name.
The
Domain Name Is Not Identical or Confusingly Similar 
to a Trademark or Service Mark in Which Complainants Have Rights
Because Complainants’ mark is not distinctive and is in
fact highly diluted, it is entitled to a very limited scope of protection.  As stated earlier, this is not a case in
which Respondent has registered domain names that are identical to
Complainants’ registered marks, such as <nesteggfundslifesimplified.com>,
<nesteggcapitalpreservationfund.com> or <nesteggfund2010.com>.  Instead, Respondent has registered a Domain
Name comprising the generic terms “nest egg” and “advisors” in a good-faith
effort to communicate to the public that its website provides information related
to its business of providing advice on saving for retirement.  Accordingly, the Domain Name is not identical
or confusingly similar to Complainants’ mark. 
See, e.g., American Airlines, Inc. v.
MegaWeb.com Inc., FA 305263 (<americanairways.com> found not
identical or confusingly similar to complainant’s famous AMERICAN AIRLINES
mark).
FINDINGS
Complainants have failed to satisfy their
burden of proof on all three required elements for UDRP proceedings.
 
DISCUSSION 
Paragraph 15(a) of the Rules for Uniform Domain
Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the “Rules”) instructs this Panel to “decide a
complaint on the basis of the statements and documents submitted in accordance
with the Policy, these Rules and any rules and principles of law that it deems
applicable.”
 
Paragraph 4(a) of the Policy requires that the Complainant must prove
each of the following three elements to obtain an order that a domain name
should be cancelled or transferred:
 
(1)              
the
domain name registered by the Respondent is identical or confusingly similar to
a trademark or service mark in which the Complainant has rights; 
(2)              
the
Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name;
and
(3)              
the domain name
has been registered and is being used in bad faith.
 
Identical and/or Confusingly
Similar
 
The disputed domain name
is not identical to Complainant’s mark. 
Complainant does not own a mark for “NestEgg Advisors” and all of
Complainant’s marks consist of composite marks featuring a combination of words
and/or designs.  Further, none of
Complainant’s registered marks contain the term “NestEgg” alone and none of the
marks contain the term “advisors.”  This
Panel finds Respondent’s disputed domain name is not confusingly similar to
Complainant’s mark under Policy ¶4(a)(i).  See Bank of Am. Corp. v. Fluxxx, Inc., FA 103809 (Nat. Arb. Forum Feb. 18, 2002) (“[I]n
light of the common use of the words ‘nations’ and  ‘banking,’ this Panel fails to see how there
is a likelihood of confusion between NATIONSBANK and <nationsbanking.com>.”);
see also FloridaFirst Bank v. Carlson, FA
143677 (Nat. Arb. Forum Apr. 10, 2003) (“Complainant has failed to establish
that the words ‘FloridaFirst,’ apart from the registered service mark as a
whole, ha[d] acquired a secondary meaning such that the relevant public
exclusively associates the words with Complainant as a source of services”).
 
The Panel finds Policy ¶4(a)(i) has not been satisfied.
 
 
Rights or Legitimate Interests
 
Complainant has established a prima facie case in support of its
arguments Respondent lacks rights and legitimate interests under Policy ¶4(a)(ii).  See Terminal Supply, Inc. v.
HI-LINE ELECTRIC, FA 746752 (Nat. Arb. Forum Aug. 24, 2006)
(holding that the complainant did not satisfactorily meet its burden and as a
result found that the respondent had rights and legitimate interests in the
domain name under UDRP ¶4(a)(ii)); see
also Workshop Way, Inc. v. Harnage, FA
739879 (Nat. Arb. Forum Aug. 9, 2006) (finding that the respondent overcame the
complainant’s burden by showing it was making a bona fide offering of
goods or services at the disputed domain name).
 
Respondent has done business under the “NestEgg Advisors,
Inc.” name since November 2006. 
Respondent provides financial planning, estate planning and related
services to individual consumers located in the Long Island, New York geographical area.  Further, Respondent notes it registered the
disputed domain name on July 28, 2005, in anticipation of its business under
that name.  Respondent did not have knowledge
of Complainant’s business or their NESTEGG marks throughout that time
period.  The WHOIS information for the disputed domain name identifies
“NestEgg Advisors, Inc.” as the registrant of the domain name and Respondent
contends that it has become commonly known by the NestEgg Advisors, Inc. name
and the <nesteggadvisors.net>
domain name through its business operations since 2006.  This Panel finds Respondent has become
commonly known by the disputed domain name pursuant to Policy ¶4(c)(ii) through its business usage of such mark in commerce
since 2006.  See Modern Props, Inc. v. Wallis, FA 152458 (Nat. Arb. Forum June 2, 2003) (finding
that as the respondent had registered its
domain name as its business identity with the New York County Clerk a month
after registering the domain name and then conducted his prop rental business
under that name, it had demonstrated rights and legitimate interests in the
domain name); see also Digitronics
Inventioneering Corp. v. @Six.Net Registered, D2000-0008 (WIPO Mar. 1,
2000) (finding that the respondent was commonly known
by the <six.net> and <sixnet.com> domain names even though the
complainant had registered the SIXNET trademark because the respondent
demonstrated that its customers associated the respondent’s company with the
domain names).
 
Respondent has been conducting its
financial services business under the NestEgg Advisors, Inc. name since
2006.  Respondent registered the disputed
domain name on July 28, 2005 and launched its website in December 2006.  Respondent did not know of Complainant’s mark
or rights in that mark until it received Complainant's cease and desist letter on December 15, 2009.  This Panel finds Respondent is making a bona fide offering of goods or services
pursuant to Policy ¶4(c)(i) through its business offerings
that have been available to the public since 2006.  See Workshop Way, Inc. v. Harnage, FA 739879 (Nat. Arb. Forum Aug. 9, 2006)
(finding that the respondent overcame the complainant’s burden by showing it
was making a bona fide offering of goods or services at the disputed
domain name); see also Modern
Props, Inc. v. Wallis, FA 152458 (Nat. Arb. Forum June 2, 2003) (finding
that the respondent’s operation of a bona fide business of online prop
rentals for over two years was evidence that the respondent had rights or
legitimate interests in the disputed domain name).
 
The Panel finds Policy ¶4(a)(ii) has not been satisfied.
 
 
Registration and Use in Bad Faith
 
Complainant has failed to meet the burden of proof of bad
faith registration and use under Policy ¶4(a)(iii).  See
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. v. Samjo CellTech.Ltd, FA
406512 (Nat. Arb. Forum Mar. 9, 2005) (finding that the complainant failed to
establish that the respondent registered and used the disputed domain name in
bad faith because mere assertions of bad faith are insufficient for a
complainant to establish Policy ¶4(a)(iii); see
also Graman USA Inc. v. Shenzhen Graman Indus. Co., FA 133676 (Nat. Arb.
Forum Jan. 16, 2003) (finding that general allegations of bad faith without
supporting facts or specific examples do not supply a sufficient basis upon
which the panel may conclude that the respondent acted in bad faith).
 
This Panel finds Respondent did not use the disputed domain
name in bad faith pursuant to Policy ¶4(a)(iii) in
part because it had rights under Policy ¶4(a)(ii).  See Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Skunkworx Custom Cycle, D2004-0824 (WIPO Jan. 18, 2005) (finding
that the issue of bad faith registration and use was moot once the panel found
the respondent had rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name);
see also Vanguard Group Inc. v. Investors Fast Track, FA 863257
(Nat. Arb. Forum Jan. 18, 2007) (“Because Respondent has rights and legitimate
interests in the disputed domain name, his registration is not in bad faith.”).
 
Respondent did not register or use the <nesteggadvisors.net> domain name in bad faith because
Respondent has not violated any of the factors listed in Policy ¶4(b) or engaged in any other conduct that would constitute
bad faith registration and use pursuant to Policy ¶4(a)(iii).  See Societe des Produits Nestle S.A. v.
Pro Fiducia Treuhand AG, D2001-0916 (WIPO Oct. 12, 2001) (finding that
where the respondent has not attempted to sell the domain name for profit, has
not engaged in a pattern of conduct depriving others of the ability to obtain
domain names corresponding to their trademarks, is not a competitor of the
complainant seeking to disrupt the complainant's business, and is not using the
domain name to divert Internet users for commercial gain, lack of bona fide
use on its own is insufficient to establish bad faith); see also Starwood
Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. v. Samjo CellTech.Ltd, FA 406512 (Nat.
Arb. Forum Mar. 9, 2005) (finding that the complainant failed to establish that
respondent registered and used the disputed domain name in bad faith because
mere assertions of bad faith are insufficient for a complainant to establish
UDRP ¶4(a)(iii)).
 
Respondent did not register the <nesteggadvisors.net> domain name to disrupt the business of
Complainant.  Furthermore, the registered
marks are not confusingly similar to the disputed domain name.  Respondent is not a competitor of Complainant
because Complainant offers mutual fund investment services to institutions,
intermediaries and others while Respondent offers financial planning, estate
planning and related services to individual consumers in the geographic area of
Long Island, New York. 
See Successful Money Mgmt. Seminars, Inc. v.
Direct Mail Express, FA 96457 (Nat. Arb. Forum Mar. 7, 2001) (finding the
domain name <seminarsuccess.com> to be generic and that the respondent
registered and used the domain name in good faith “because Respondent selected
the name in good faith for its web site, and was offering services under the domain
name prior to the initiation of the dispute”); see also PRIMEDIA Special Interest Publ’ns. Inc. v. Treadway, D2000-0752 (WIPO Aug. 21,
2000) (holding that the respondent did not register or use the
<shutterbug.com> domain name to disrupt the complainant’s business
because the respondent’s contemplated use at the time of acquisition was not
necessarily competitive with the complainant’s SHUTTERBUG magazine).
 
Respondent is using the disputed domain name for a
legitimate business purpose and did not mean or try to cause confusion with
Complainant’s marks.  The Panel finds
Respondent did not register the domain name in bad faith under Policy ¶4(b)(iv) where it has been making a legitimate use of the
domain name since 2006.  See Schering
AG v. Metagen GmbH, D2000-0728 (WIPO Sept. 11, 2000) (finding that the
respondent did not register or use the domain name <metagen.com> in bad
faith where the respondent registered the domain name in connection with a fair
business interest and no likelihood of confusion was created); see also Mule Lighting, Inc. v. CPA, FA 95558 (Nat. Arb. Forum Oct. 17,
2000) (finding no bad faith where the respondent has an active website that has
been in use for two years and where there was no intent to cause confusion with
the complainant’s website and business).
 
The Panel finds Policy ¶4(a)(iii) has not been satisfied.
 
DECISION
Having established all three elements required under the ICANN Policy,
the Panel concludes that relief shall be DENIED.

[1]
Complainant A executed this Agreement under its former name, Arrivato Advisors,
LLC.


[2] It is
conceivable that at least part of Respondent’s business is as a conduit of
NestEgg inquiries intended for Complainants over to Respondent-related
providers.


[3] In
scrupulous adherence to Evidence Rule 408, Complainants have not produced a
letter from Respondent which only purports to be in settlement, but may shed
light on the reason for this choice. 
Complainants determined not to raise the claim in filing this
proceeding, but will make the letter available to the Panel for consideration
on this issue at Panel’s request.


[4]               Complainants are also parties to a
coexistence agreement between themselves concerning their registration and use
of their NESTEGG marks.  See
Complaint at 1.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        August 3, 2016.
        
          AGENCY:
Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”).
ACTION:
Notice of an application under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Act”) for an exemption from section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act, as well as from certain disclosure requirements in rule 20a-1 under the Act, Item 19(a)(3) of Form N-1A, Items 22(c)(1)(ii), 22(c)(1)(iii), 22(c)(8) and 22(c)(9) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 6-07(2)(a), (b), and (c) of Regulation S-X (“Disclosure Requirements”). The requested exemption would permit an investment adviser to hire and replace certain sub-advisers without shareholder approval and grant relief from the Disclosure Requirements as they relate to fees paid to the sub-advisers.
Applicants:
American Independence Funds Trust and Rx Funds Trust (each, a “Trust” and collectively, the “Trusts”), each a Delaware statutory trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company with multiple series, and RiskX Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“RiskX Investments” or the “Adviser,” and, collectively with the Trusts, the “Applicants”).
Filing Dates:
The application was filed June 30, 2016, and amended August 2, 2016 and August 2, 2016.
Hearing or Notification of Hearing:
An order granting the application will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. on August 24, 2016, and should be accompanied by proof of service on the applicants, in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Pursuant to rule 0-5 under the Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, any facts bearing upon the desirability of a hearing on the matter, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request notification by writing to the Commission's Secretary.
ADDRESSES:
Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE., Washington, DC 20549-1090. Applicants: 1345 Avenue of the Americas, Second Floor, New York, NY 10105.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Summary of the Application
1. The Adviser will serve as the investment adviser to the Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with each Trust (the “Advisory Agreement”).[1] 
           The Adviser Start Printed Page 52494will provide the Funds with continuous and comprehensive investment management services subject to the supervision of, and policies established by, each Fund's board of trustees (“Board”). The Advisory Agreement permits the Adviser, subject to the approval of the Board, to delegate to one or more sub-advisers (each, a “Sub-Adviser” and collectively, the “Sub-Advisers”) the responsibility to provide the day-to-day portfolio investment management of each Fund, subject to the supervision and direction of the Adviser. The primary responsibility for managing the Funds will remain vested in the Adviser. The Adviser will hire, evaluate, allocate assets to and oversee the Sub-Advisers, including determining whether a Sub-Adviser should be terminated, at all times subject to the authority of the Board.
2. Applicants request an exemption to permit the Adviser, subject to Board approval, to hire certain Sub-Advisers pursuant to Sub-Advisory Agreements and materially amend existing Sub-Advisory Agreements without obtaining the shareholder approval required under section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act.[2] 
           Applicants also seek an exemption from the Disclosure Requirements to permit a Fund to disclose (as both a dollar amount and a percentage of the Fund's net assets): (a) The aggregate fees paid to the Adviser and any Affiliated Sub-Adviser; and (b) the aggregate fees paid to Sub-Advisers other than Affiliated Sub-Advisers (collectively, “Aggregate Fee Disclosure”). For any Fund that employs an Affiliated Sub-Adviser, the Fund will provide separate disclosure of any fees paid to the Affiliated Sub-Adviser.
3. Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the Application. Such terms and conditions provide for, among other safeguards, appropriate disclosure to Fund shareholders and notification about sub-advisory changes and enhanced Board oversight to protect the interests of the Funds' shareholders.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or any rule thereunder, if such relief is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe that the requested relief meets this standard because, as further explained in the Application, the Advisory Agreements will remain subject to shareholder approval, while the role of the Sub-Advisers is substantially similar to that of individual portfolio managers, so that requiring shareholder approval of Sub-Advisory Agreements would impose unnecessary delays and expenses on the Funds. Applicants believe that the requested relief from the Disclosure Requirements meets this standard because it will improve the Adviser's ability to negotiate fees paid to the Sub-Advisers that are more advantageous for the Funds.

Footnotes

1.
     Applicants request relief with respect to any existing and any future series of each Trust and any other registered open-end management company or series thereof that: (a) Is advised by RiskX Investments or its successor or by a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with RiskX Investments or its successor (each, also an “Adviser”); (b) uses the manager of managers structure described in the application; and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of the application (any such series, a “Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”). For purposes of the requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity that results from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization.

2.
     The requested relief will not extend to any Sub-Adviser, other than a “Wholly-Owned Sub-Adviser” (as defined in the application), that is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of a Fund or the Adviser, other than by reason of serving as a sub-adviser to one or more of the Funds (“Affiliated Sub-Adviser”).
