FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

About Us
MHR Fund Management LLC ("MHR" or the "Firm") manages in excess of $5 billion and takes a highly differentiated, control-focused, private equity approach to investing in distressed and undervalued middle-market companies utilizing its proprietary approach to sourcing.  MHR is an active investor that seeks to exert control or significant influence on its portfolio companies, which the Firm believes is essential to preserving and creating value.  The Firm employs a rigorous, due diligence-focused investment process with a strong emphasis on downside protection that capitalizes on its deep industry knowledge and analytical capabilities.  MHR may utilize the bankruptcy or restructuring process to improve both the capital structure and the cost structure of its portfolio companies. In addition, the Firm may seek to create long-term value beyond the turnaround process by continuing to improve operations, growing companies and effectuating successful exits.  MHR believes its focus on growing companies either organically or through acquisition in addition to restructuring them is differentiated and serves to generate highly attractive returns for its limited partners across various investing environments.
