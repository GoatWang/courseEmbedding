WHEREAS, the Banking Commissioner (the Commissioner) is responsible for administering Chapter 672a of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act (the Act) and Sections 36b-31-2 et seq. of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (the Regulations) promulgated under the Act;

WHEREAS, effective July 1, 1997 and following passage of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, P.A. 97-220 amended Section 36b-21 of the Act to add a new subsection (e), requiring that persons offering or selling a security that is a covered security under Section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act of 1933 [i.e. Rule 506 transactions] to file a notice with the commissioner within fifteen days after the first sale of such a security in this state and pay an associated fee of $150;
WHEREAS, in a good faith effort to address the filing delinquency, counsel to the Fund included with the Funds November 21, 2013 correspondence a curative filing and associated fee pursuant to Section 36b-21(e) of the Act;

WHEREAS, the Fund desires to settle the matters described herein and voluntarily enters into this Stipulation and Agreement;
WHEREAS, the Commissioner and the Fund acknowledge that this Stipulation and Agreement is in lieu of any court action or administrative proceeding against the Fund, its partners, officers, employees, agents or representatives adjudicating any issue of fact or law on the specific matters described herein;
WHEREAS, the Fund, through its execution of this Stipulation and Agreement, voluntarily waives any rights it may have to seek judicial review or otherwise challenge or contest the terms and conditions of this Stipulation and Agreement;
NOW THEREFORE, THE PARTIES HERETO DO MUTUALLY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

Nothing in this Stipulation and Agreement shall be construed as limiting the Commissioners ability to take enforcement action against Corre Opportunities Fund, LP based upon evidence of which the Division was unaware on the date hereof relating to a violation of the Act or any regulation or order under the Act; and
