Our Fiduciary ResponsibilityMany individuals might give you financial advice: insurance agents, CPAs, brokers, even your neighborhood barber and Uncle Bob. What you should focus on is finding someone who has your best interest at heart. Someone you can trust.
Investment Advisors are held to a Fiduciary Standard and are required to put their clients’ interests above their own. This means that they must do their best to make sure that their investment advice stems from accurate and complete analysis of each client’s full financial profile instead of proposing trades that may result in higher commissions for themselves. Additionally, Registered Investment Advisors must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must place their own personal interests second to that of their clients at all times. Their first obligation must be to serve their clients.
Our fiduciary responsibility is a core value of White Pine Investment Company.
WHITE PINE NEWSWHITE PINE INVESTS IN DETROIT
 White Pine Investment Company continues its legacy of community involvement once again by partnering with the Life Remodeled 2016 Project. Life Remodeled (www.liferemodeled.com), a Detroit-based nonprofit that seeks to remodel lives along with neighborhoods, utilized a workforce of over 10,000 volunteers from community organizations, churches, businesses and people who care about the City of Detroit.
This year’s project was a massive undertaking: build a new park adjacent to Denby High School, renovate 79 homes, build a new community center, remove blight on 303 city blocks, board up 362 houses, and demarcate safe pathways to schools. Despite the 90 degree temperature and high humidity, the volunteers stretching from across the state of Michigan and its surrounding states were not discouraged.
“This is a pretty dramatic example of what happens when everybody pulls together… It’s the kind of respectful partnership that has a really powerful effect” says Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.

Background Information:


White Pine Investment Co. »
White Pine Investment Co. (WPIC) buys individual securities and ETFs in most accounts but does invest client dollars in money market funds, no-load mutual funds or load funds that allow investment advisors to buy their shares at net asset value. These mutual funds are used to meet each client's unique and specific investment objectives. Diversification in smaller accounts often makes it necessary to purchase mutual funds and/or ETFs rather than individual securities.

Company Description


White Pine Investment Co. (WPIC) buys individual securities and ETFs in most accounts but does invest client dollars in money market funds, no-load mutual funds or load funds that allow investment advisors to buy their shares at net asset value. These mutual funds are used to meet each client's unique and specific investment objectives. Diversification in smaller accounts often makes it necessary to purchase mutual funds and/or ETFs rather than individual securities.

Our Fiduciary ResponsibilityMany individuals might give you financial advice: insurance agents, CPAs, brokers, even your neighborhood barber and Uncle Bob. What you should focus on is finding someone who has your best interest at heart. Someone you can trust.
Investment Advisors are held to a Fiduciary Standard and are required to put their clients’ interests above their own. This means that they must do their best to make sure that their investment advice stems from accurate and complete analysis of each client’s full financial profile instead of proposing trades that may result in higher commissions for themselves. Additionally, Registered Investment Advisors must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must place their own personal interests second to that of their clients at all times. Their first obligation must be to serve their clients.
Our fiduciary responsibility is a core value of White Pine Investment Company.
WHITE PINE NEWSWHITE PINE INVESTS IN DETROIT
 White Pine Investment Company continues its legacy of community involvement once again by partnering with the Life Remodeled 2016 Project. Life Remodeled (www.liferemodeled.com), a Detroit-based nonprofit that seeks to remodel lives along with neighborhoods, utilized a workforce of over 10,000 volunteers from community organizations, churches, businesses and people who care about the City of Detroit.
This year’s project was a massive undertaking: build a new park adjacent to Denby High School, renovate 79 homes, build a new community center, remove blight on 303 city blocks, board up 362 houses, and demarcate safe pathways to schools. Despite the 90 degree temperature and high humidity, the volunteers stretching from across the state of Michigan and its surrounding states were not discouraged.
“This is a pretty dramatic example of what happens when everybody pulls together… It’s the kind of respectful partnership that has a really powerful effect” says Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.
