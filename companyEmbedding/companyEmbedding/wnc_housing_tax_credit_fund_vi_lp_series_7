SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (telephone (202) 942-8090). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. Each Series was formed in 2003 as a California limited partnership. Each Series will operate as a “two-tier” partnership, i.e., each Series will invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (“Local Limited Partnerships”). The Local Limited Partnerships in turn will engage in the ownership and operation of apartment complexes expected to be qualified for low income housing tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The General Partner is a California limited liability company whose sole member is WNC & Associates, Inc. (“WNC & Associates”), a California corporation. 
2. The objectives of each Series are (a) to provide current tax benefits primarily in the form of low income housing credits which investors may use to offset their Federal income tax liabilities, (b) to preserve and protect capital, and (c) to provide cash distributions from sale or refinancing transactions. 
3. On July 21, 2003, the Fund filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to which the Fund intends to offer publicly, in two series of offerings, 25,000 units of limited partnership interest (“Units”) at $1,000 per unit. The minimum investment will be five Units for most investors, although employees of the General Partner and/or its affiliates and/or investors in syndications previously sponsored by the General Partner and/or its affiliates may purchase a minimum of two Units. Purchasers of the Units will become limited partners (“Limited Partners”) of the Series offering the Units. 
4. A Series will not accept any subscriptions for Units until the requested exemptive order is granted or the Series receives an opinion of counsel that it is exempt from registration under the Act. Subscriptions for Units must be approved by the General Partner. Such approval will be conditioned upon representations as to suitability of the investment for each subscriber. The suitability standards provide, among other things, that investment in a Series is suitable only for an investor who either (a) has a net worth (exclusive of home, furnishings, and automobiles), of at least $35,000 and an annual gross income of at least $35,000, or (b) irrespective of annual income, has a net worth (exclusive of home, furnishings, and automobiles) of at least $75,000. Units will be sold only to investors who meet these suitability standards, or such more restrictive suitability standards as may be established by certain states for purchasers of Units within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, transfers of Units will be permitted only if the transferee meets the same suitability standards as had been imposed on the transferor Limited Partner. 
5. Although a Series' direct control over the management of each apartment complex will be limited, the Series' ownership of interests in Local Limited Partnerships will, in an economic sense, be tantamount to direct ownership of the apartment complexes themselves. A Series normally will acquire at least a 90% interest in the profits, losses, and tax credits of the Local Limited Partnerships. However, in certain cases, the Series may acquire a lesser interest in such partnerships. Each Local Limited Partnership's partnership agreement will provide that distributions of proceeds from a sale or refinancing of an apartment complex will be paid to a Series in the range of from 10% to 50%. 
6. Each Series will have certain voting rights with respect to each Local Limited Partnership. The voting rights will include the right to dismiss and replace the local general partner on the basis of performance, to approve or disapprove a sale or refinancing of the apartment complex owned by such Local Limited Partnership, to approve or disapprove the dissolution of the Local Limited Partnership, and to approve or disapprove amendments to the Local Start Printed Page 57942Limited Partnership agreement materially and adversely affecting the Series' investment. 
7. Each Series will be controlled by the General Partner, pursuant to a partnership agreement (the “Partnership Agreement”). The Limited Partners, consistent with their limited liability status, will not be entitled to participate in the control of the business of the Series. However, a majority-in-interest of the Limited Partners will have the right to amend the Partnership Agreement (subject to certain limitations), to remove any General Partner and elect a replacement, and to dissolve the Series. In addition, under the Partnership Agreement, each Limited Partner is entitled to review all books and records of the Series. 
8. Applicants state that the Partnership Agreement and prospectus of the Series contain provisions designed to ensure fair dealing by the General Partner with the Limited Partners. Applicants also state that all compensation to be paid to the General Partner and its affiliates is specified in the Partnership Agreement and prospectus. Applicants believe that the fees and other forms of compensation that will be paid to the General Partner and its affiliates are fair and on terms no less favorable to the Series than would be the case if such arrangements had been made with independent third parties. 
9. During the offering and organizational phase, WNC Capital Corporation, an affiliate of the General Partner, will receive a dealer-manager fee and a nonaccountable underwriting expense allowance in amounts equal to 2% and 1%, respectively, of capital contributions. The General Partner or an affiliate will receive a nonaccountable organizational and offering expense reimbursement in an amount equal to 3% of capital contributions. The General Partner has agreed to pay all organizational and offering expenses (excluding selling commissions, the dealer-manager fee, the nonaccountable underwriting expense allowance and the nonaccountable expense reimbursement). 
10. During the acquisition phase, each Series will pay WNC & Associates a fee equal to 7% of capital contributions for analyzing and evaluating potential investments in Local Limited Partnerships and for various other services. WNC & Associates will receive a nonaccountable acquisition expense reimbursement equal to 2% of capital contributions in consideration of which WNC & Associates will pay all acquisition expenses of each Series. Aggregate fees and expenses paid in connection with the organization of each Series, the offering of Units, and the acquisition of Local Limited Partnership interests by each Series will be limited by the Partnership Agreement and will comply with guidelines published by the North American Securities Administrators Association. These guidelines require that a specified percentage (generally 80%, but subject to reduction) of the aggregate Limited Partners' capital contributions to the Fund be committed to Local Limited Partnership interests. 
11. During the operating phase, the General Partner will receive 0.1% of any cash available for distribution, and each Series may pay certain fees and reimbursements to the General Partner or its affiliates. An asset management fee will be payable for services related to the administration of the affairs of each Series and ongoing management of each Series. Other fees may be paid in consideration of property management services provided by the General Partner or its affiliates as the management and leasing agents for some of the apartment complexes. In addition, the General Partner and its affiliates generally will be allocated 0.1% of profits and losses of each Series for tax purposes and tax credits. 
12. During the liquidation phase, and subject to certain prior payments to the Limited Partners, each Series will pay the General Partner or its affiliates a fee equal to 1% of the sales price of the apartment complexes sold in which the General Partner or its affiliates have provided a substantial amount of services. The General Partner also will receive 10% of any additional sale or refinancing proceeds. 
13. All proceeds from a Series' public offering of Units initially will be placed in an escrow account with USbank (“Escrow Agent”). Pending release of offering proceeds to the Series, the Escrow Agent will deposit escrowed funds in short-term United States Government securities, securities issued or guaranteed by the United States Government, and certificates of deposit or time or demand deposits in commercial banks. Upon receipt of a prescribed minimum amount of capital contributions for a Series, funds in escrow will be released to the Series and held by it pending investment in Local Limited Partnerships. 
14. If more than one entity that the General Partner or its affiliates advises or manages may invest in a particular investment opportunity, the decision as to the entity that will be allocated the investment will be based upon such factors as the effect of the acquisition on diversification of each entity's portfolio, the estimated income tax effects of the purchase on each entity, the amount of funds of each entity available for investment, and the length of time such funds have been available for investment. Priority generally will be given to the entity having uninvested funds for the longest period of time. However, any entity that was formed to invest primarily in apartment complexes eligible for state low income housing tax credits (“state tax credits”) as well as for Federal low income housing tax credits will be given priority with respect to any investment that is eligible for state tax credits over entities which are not seeking to provide state tax credits. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Applicants believe that the Fund and its Series will not be “investment companies” under sections 3(a)(1)(A) or 3(a)(1)(C) of the Act. If the Fund and its Series are deemed to be investment companies, however, applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) and 6(e) of the Act from all provisions of the Act, except sections 37 through 53 of the Act and the rules and regulations under those sections. 
2. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Applicants believe that the Fund will not be an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(A) because the Fund will be in the business of investing in and being beneficial owner of apartment complexes, not securities. 
3. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer's total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items). Applicants state that although the Local Limited Partnership interests may be deemed “investment securities,” they are not readily marketable, cannot be sold without severe adverse tax consequences, and have no value apart from the value of the apartment complexes owned by the Local Limited Partnerships. 
4. Applicants believe that the two-tier structure is consistent with the purposes and criteria set forth in the Commission's release concerning two-tier real estate partnerships (the Start Printed Page 57943“Release”).[1] 
           The Release states that investment companies that are two-tier real estate partnerships that invest in limited partnerships engaged in the development and operation of housing for low and moderate income persons may qualify for an exemption from the Act pursuant to section 6(c). Section 6(c) provides that the Commission may exempt any person from any provision of the Act and any rule thereunder, if, and to the extent that, such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 6(e) permits the Commission to require companies exempted from the registration requirements of the Act to comply with certain specified provisions of the Act as though the company were a registered investment company. 
5. The Release lists two conditions, designed for the protection of investors, which must be satisfied by two-tier partnerships to qualify for the exemption under section 6(c). First, interests in the issuer should be sold only to persons for whom investments in limited profit, essentially tax-shelter, investments would not be unsuitable. Second, requirements for fair dealing by the general partner of the issuer with the limited partners of the issuer should be included in the basic organizational documents of the company. 
6. Applicants assert, among other things, that the suitability standards set forth in the application, the requirements for fair dealing provided by the Partnership Agreement, and pertinent governmental regulations imposed on each Local Limited Partnership by various Federal, state, and local agencies provide protection to investors in Units. In addition, applicants assert that the requested exemption is both necessary and appropriate in the public interest.

Organization

 

WNC
Housing Tax Credit Fund VI, L.P., Series 7 (the "Partnership"), is
a California Limited Partnership formed on June 16, 1997 under the
laws of the State of California and commenced operations on
September 3, 1999.  The Partnership was formed to acquire
limited partnership interests in other limited partnerships
(“Local Limited Partnerships”) which own multi-family
housing complexes (“Housing Complexes”) that are
eligible for Federal low income housing tax credits (“Low
Income Housing Tax Credits”).  The local general
partners (the “Local General Partners”) of each Local
Limited Partnership retain responsibility for maintaining,
operating and managing the Housing Complexes. Each Local Limited
Partnership is governed by its agreement of limited partnership
(the “Local Limited Partnership Agreement”).

 

The
general partner of the Partnership is WNC & Associates, Inc., a
California corporation (“Associates” or the
“General Partner”). The chairman and president of
Associates owns all of the outstanding stock of
Associates.  The business of the Partnership is conducted
primarily through Associates, as the Partnership has no employees
of its own.

 

The
Partnership shall continue in full force and effect until December
31, 2060 unless terminated prior to that date pursuant to the
partnership agreement or law.

 

The
financial statements include only activity relating to the business
of the Partnership, and do not give effect to any assets that the
partners may have outside of their interests in the Partnership, or
to any obligations, including income taxes, of the
partners.

 

The
Partnership Agreement authorized the sale of up to 25,000 units of
limited partnership interest (“Partnership Units”) at
$1,000 per Partnership Unit. The offering of Partnership Units has
concluded and 18,850 Partnership Units representing subscriptions
in the amount of $18,828,790, net of dealer discounts of $21,210
had been accepted.  The General Partner has a 0.1%
interest in operating profits and losses, taxable income and
losses, cash available for distribution from the Partnership and
Low Income Housing Tax Credits of the Partnership. The investors
(the “Limited Partners”) will be allocated the
remaining 99.9% of these items in proportion to their respective
investments.

 

The
proceeds from the disposition of any of the Local Limited
Partnership Housing Complexes will be used first to pay debts and
other obligations per the respective Local Limited Partnership
Agreement.  Any remaining proceeds will then be paid to
the Partnership.  The sale of a Housing Complex may be
subject to other restrictions and
obligations.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
a Local Limited Partnership will be able to sell its Housing
Complex.  Even if it does so, there can be no assurance
that any    
significant      
 amounts   
of      
 cash      will  
 be    distributed    
 to   the 
 Partnership.      
Should    
such      
distributions   occur,     
the     Limited    
Partners       will   
 be     entitled   
to     receive     
distributions    equal   to 
their  capital   contributions  and

their
return on investment (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) and
the General Partner would then be entitled to receive
proceeds  equal to its capital contributions from the
remainder.  Any additional sale or refinancing proceeds
will be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners (in proportion to
their respective investments) and 10% to the General
Partner.

 

Risks and
Uncertainties

 

An
investment in the Partnership and the Partnership’s
investments in Local Limited Partnerships and their Housing
Complexes are subject to risks.  These risks may impact
the tax benefits of an investment in the Partnership, and the
amount of proceeds available for distribution to the Limited
Partners, if any, on liquidation of the Partnership’s
investments.  Some of those risks include the
following:

 

The Low
Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated.
Noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future Low
Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low
Income Housing Tax Credits already taken. In most cases the annual
amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use
is limited to the tax liability due on the person’s last
$25,000 of taxable income. The Local Limited Partnerships may be
unable to sell the Housing Complexes at a price which would result
in the Partnership realizing cash distributions or proceeds from
the transaction.  Accordingly, the Partnership may be
unable to distribute any cash to its Limited Partners. Low Income
Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in
the Partnership.

 

The
Partnership has invested in a limited number of Local Limited
Partnerships. Such limited diversity means that the results of
operation of each single Housing Complex will have a greater impact
on the Partnership. With limited diversity, poor performance of one
Housing Complex could impair the Partnership’s ability to
satisfy its investment objectives.  Each Housing Complex
is subject to mortgage indebtedness. If a Local Limited Partnership
failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its Housing Complex in
foreclosure. If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15
years, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax
Credits, a fractional recapture of prior Low Income Housing Tax
Credits, and a loss of the Partnership’s investment in the
Housing Complex would occur. The Partnership is a limited partner
or a non-managing member of each Local Limited Partnership.
Accordingly, the Partnership will have very limited rights with
respect to management of the Local Limited Partnerships. The
Partnership will rely totally on the Local General Partners.
Neither the Partnership’s investments in Local Limited
Partnerships, nor the Local Limited Partnerships’ investments
in Housing Complexes, are readily marketable. To the extent the
Housing Complexes receive government financing or operating
subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following
risks: difficulties in obtaining tenants for the Housing Complexes;
difficulties in obtaining rent increases; limitations on cash
distributions; limitations on sales or refinancing of Housing
Complexes; limitations on transfers of interests in Local Limited
Partnerships; limitations on removal of Local General Partners;
limitations on subsidy programs; and possible changes in applicable
regulations.  Uninsured casualties could result in loss
of property and Low Income Housing Tax Credits and recapture of Low
Income Housing Tax Credits previously taken. The value of real
estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions,
including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use
and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar Housing
Complexes, and neighborhood conditions, among others.

 

The
ability of Limited Partners to claim tax losses from the
Partnership is limited. The IRS may audit the Partnership or a
Local Limited Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax
items. The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses
allocable to Limited Partners could be reduced if the IRS were
successful in such a challenge.  The alternative minimum
tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in the
Partnership.  Changes in tax laws could also impact the
tax benefits from an investment in the Partnership and/or the value
of the Housing Complexes.

NOTE 1 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued

 

No trading
market for the Partnership Units exists or is expected to develop.
Limited Partners may be unable to sell their Partnership Units
except at a discount and should consider their Partnership Units to
be a long-term investment. Individual Limited Partners will have no
recourse if they disagree with actions authorized by a vote of the
majority of  Limited Partners.

 

Exit
Strategy

 

The
Compliance Period for a Housing Complex is generally 15 years
following construction or rehabilitation completion. Associates was
one of the first in the industry to offer syndicated investments in
Low Income Housing Tax Credits.  The initial programs are
completing their Compliance Periods.

 

Upon the
sale of a Local Limited Partnership or Housing Complex after the
end of the Compliance Period, there would be no recapture of Low
Income Housing Tax Credits. A sale prior to the end of the
Compliance Period could result in recapture if certain conditions
are not met.  None of the Local Limited Partnership have
completed their 15-year Compliance Period.

 

With that
in mind, the General Partner is continuing its review of the
Housing Complexes, with special emphasis on the more mature Housing
Complexes such as any that have satisfied the IRS compliance
requirements.  The review considers many factors,
including extended use requirements (such as those due to mortgage
restrictions or state compliance agreements), the condition of the
Local Limited Partnerships, and the tax consequences to the Limited
Partners from the sale of the Housing Complexes.

 

Upon
identifying those Housing Complexes with the highest potential for
a successful sale, refinancing or syndication, the Partnership
expects to proceed with efforts to liquidate them. The objective is
to maximize the Limited Partners’ return wherever possible
and, ultimately, to wind down the Partnership. Local Limited
Partnership interests may be disposed of any time by the General
Partner in its discretion. While liquidation of the Housing
Complexes continues to be evaluated, the dissolution of the
Partnership was not imminent as of December 31, 2008. As of
December 31, 2008, no Local Limited Partnerships have been sold and
one Local Limited Partnership, Lake Village Apartments, L.P., has
been identified for disposition.

 

Method of
Accounting for Investments in Local Limited
Partnerships

 

The
Partnership accounts for its investments in Local Limited
Partnerships using the equity method of accounting, whereby the
Partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the
Local Limited Partnerships’ results of operations and for any
contributions made and distributions received. The Partnership
reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a Local
Limited Partnership for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such
investment may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of
such investment is measured by the estimated value derived by
management, generally consisting of the sum of the remaining future
Low Income Housing Tax Credits estimated to be allocable to the
Partnership and the estimated residual value to the
Partnership.   If an investment is considered to be
impaired, the Partnership reduces the carrying value of its
investment in any such Local Limited Partnership.  The
accounting policies of the Local Limited Partnerships, generally,
are expected to be consistent with those of the Partnership. Costs
incurred by the Partnership in acquiring the investments are
capitalized as part of the investment account and are being
amortized over 30 years (see Note 2).

NOTE 1 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued

 

“Equity
in losses of Local Limited Partnerships” for the periods
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 have been recorded by the
Partnership. Management’s estimate for the three and
nine-month period is based on either actual unaudited results
reported by the Local Limited Partnerships or historical trends in
the operations of the Local Limited Partnerships. In subsequent
annual financial statements, upon receiving the actual annual
results reported by the Local Limited Partnerships, management
reverses its prior estimate and records the actual results reported
by the Local Limited Partnerships.  Equity in losses of
Local Limited Partnerships allocated to the Partnership are not
recognized to   the extent that the investment
balance would be adjusted below zero.  If the Local
Limited Partnerships reported net income in future years, the
Partnership will resume applying the equity method only after its
share of such net income equals the share of net losses not
recognized during the period(s) the equity method was suspended
(see Note 2).

 

In
accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of
variable interest entities, the Partnership determines when it
should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a
variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and
when it should disclose information about its relationship with a
VIE. A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold
assets, and a VIE must be consolidated by a company if it is the
primary beneficiary because a primary beneficiary absorbs the
majority of the entity’s expected losses, the majority of the
expected residual returns, or both. The Local Limited Partnerships
in which the Partnership invests are VIEs. However, management does
not consolidate the Partnership’s interests in these
VIE’s as the Partnership is not considered the primary
beneficiary. The Partnership’s balance in its investment in
Local Limited Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax
credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its
maximum exposure to loss. The Partnership may be subject to
additional losses to the extent of any financial support that the
Partnership voluntarily provides to the Local Limited Partnerships
in the future.

 

Distributions
received by the Partnership are accounted for as a reduction of the
investment balance.  Distributions received after the
investment has reached zero are recognized as income.  As
of December 31, 2008, one of the investment balances had reached
zero.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could
materially differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

The
Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.  As of December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2008,
the Partnership had no cash equivalents.

 

Reporting
Comprehensive Income

 

The
Partnership had no items of other comprehensive income for all
periods presented.

 

Concentration
of Credit Risk

 

As of
December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2008, the Partnership maintained
cash balances at certain financial institutions in excess of the
federally insured maximum.  The Partnership believes it
is not exposed to any significant financial risk on
cash.

NOTE 1 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,

Income
Taxes

 

The
Partnership has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for
income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject

to income
taxes. Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax
credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on
their respective income tax returns. The Partnership’s
federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal
status as a partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership is not
required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a
pass-through entity. The Partnership is required to file and does
file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing
authorities. Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect
a provision for income taxes and the Partnership has no other tax
positions which must be considered for disclosure.

 

Net Loss
Per Partnership Unit

 

Net loss
per Partnership Unit includes no dilution and is computed by
dividing loss allocated to Limited Partners by the weighted average
number of Partnership Units outstanding during the
period.  Calculation of diluted net loss per Partnership
Unit is not required.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

The
Partnership is entitled to receive reporting fees from the Local
Limited Partnerships.  The intent of the reporting fees
is to offset (in part) administrative costs incurred by the
Partnership in corresponding with the Local Limited
Partnerships.  Due to the uncertainty of the collection
of these fees, the Partnership recognizes reporting fees as
collections are made.

 

Amortization

 

Acquisition
fees and costs are being amortized over 30 years using the
straight-line method. Amortization expense for each of the nine
months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $29,427.

 

Impairment

 

The
Partnership reviews its investments in Local Limited Partnerships
for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such investments
may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amount of the investment to the sum of the total
amount of the remaining Low Income Housing Tax Credits allocated to
the Partnership and any estimated residual value of the investment.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, impairment
loss related to investments in Local Limited Partnerships was
$1,208,418 and $247,227, respectively.

 

The
Partnership also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in
connection with its investments in Local Limited Partnerships.
Impairment on the intangibles is measured by comparing the
Partnership’s total investment balance after impairment of
investments in Local Limited Partnerships to the sum of the total
of the remaining Low Income Housing Tax Credits allocated to the
Partnership and the estimated residual value of the investment.
During each of the nine months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, no
impairment loss was recorded on the related intangibles.

Certain
Local Limited Partnerships have incurred significant operating
losses and/or have working capital deficiencies.  In the
event these Local Limited Partnerships continue to incur
significant operating losses, additional capital contributions by
the Partnership may be required to sustain operations of such Local
Limited Partnerships.  If additional capital
contributions are not made when they are required, the
Partnership's investments in certain of such Local Limited
Partnerships could be impaired, and the loss and recapture of the
related Low Income Housing Tax Credits could occur.

 

NOTE 3 -
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

Under the
terms of the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has paid or is
obligated to the General Partner or its affiliates for the
following fees:

 




(a)  



Acquisition
fees of up to 7% of the gross proceeds from the sale of Partnership
Units as compensation for services rendered in connection with the
acquisition of Local Limited Partnerships.  At the end of
all periods presented, the Partnership incurred acquisition fees of
$1,319,500.  Accumulated amortization of these
capitalized costs was $475,343 and $445,916 as of December 31, 2008
and March 31, 2008, respectively.




 




(b)  



Reimbursement
of costs incurred by the General Partner or an affiliate in
connection with the acquisition of Local Limited
Partnerships.  These reimbursements have not exceeded 2%
of the gross proceeds.  As of the end of all periods
presented, the Partnership incurred acquisition costs of $377,000,
which have been included in investments in Local Limited
Partnerships.  The acquisition costs were fully amortized
for all periods presented.




 




(c)  



An annual
asset management fee equal to 0.2% of the invested assets of the
Partnership, as defined.  “Invested Assets”
means the sum of the Partnership’s investment in Local
Limited Partnership interests and the Partnership’s allocable
share of mortgage loans
