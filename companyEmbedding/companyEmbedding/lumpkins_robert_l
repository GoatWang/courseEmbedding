Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Fertilizer stocks surge to lead S&P 500 gainers as corn prices jump to 13-month high
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    2:59 PM ET 07/10/2017
                                                


Shares of fertilizer companies were sharply higher Monday, as a spike higher in prices for corn, which is used to develop fertilizer, helped fuel and support the gains. CF Industries Holdings Inc.' s stock shot up 7.1% toward a three-month high, enough to make it the biggest percentage gainer in the S&P 500 index. Fellow fertilizer maker Mosaic Co.' s shares were the second biggest S&P 500 gainer, as they ran up 6.5% to a two-month high.

















                                                    40 S&P 500 stocks have slumped 20% or more in 2017
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    10:37 AM ET 07/08/2017
                                                


Energy and retail companies dominate the list of losers. The benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.9% on Thursday and has pulled back 1.8% since its most recent closing high on June 19. While the numbers don't seem alarming, the tone in the financial media has turned negative. Don't miss: Should you sell the U.S. stock market and buy the rest of the world?

















                                                    "Hammer, hammer, hammer": Canada lobbies U.S. before NAFTA talks
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    1:00 AM ET 06/29/2017
                                                


In the baking Ohio heat Canada's trade minister is trying to save NAFTA, one encounter at a time. Francois-Philippe Champagne is in Cincinnati for a meeting-packed June day as part of a concerted Canadian outreach campaign ahead of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump describes the 1994 pact as a disaster and has threatened to walk away from it.
