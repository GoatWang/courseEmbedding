History[edit]
Before 2007[edit]
In 1996, Cardinal Health acquired PCI (Headquarters: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania).[4] PCI (Packaging Coordinators Inc.) is a pharmaceutical contract packing service for commercial and clinical packaging.[5] In 1998, Cardinal Health acquired R.P. Scherer Corporation (Headquarters: Troy, Michigan).[6] Robert Pauli Scherer founded the R.P. Scherer Corporation to commercialize his innovation of softgel encapsulation using the rotary die production process.[7] In 1999, Cardinal Health acquired Automatic Liquid Packaging, Inc. (Headquarters: Woodstock, Ill.),[4] whose Blow-Fill-Seal Technology allowed Cardinal to enter the sterile product market.[7] Cardinal Health also acquired International Processing Corporation (Headquarters: Winchester, Kentucky) for its advanced controlled drug release and coating manufacturing expertise.[8]
In 2002, Cardinal Health acquired Magellan Laboratories Inc., a company that specialized in product development expertise.[4] In 2003, Cardinal Health acquired Gala Biotech (Headquarters: Middleton, Wisconsin).[4] Gala Biotech had established technologies surrounding gene insertion and the production of pharmaceutical proteins, which became GPEx® Technology.[9] In the same year, Cardinal Health also acquired Intercare Group PLC, broadening its global capabilities in Europe.[4] In 2004-2006, Cardinal Health further expanded its reach in biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets through multiple other acquisitions.[4]
Formation of Catalent in 2007[edit]
In 2007, the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment of Cardinal Health was purchased by Blackstone Group and re-branded as Catalent Pharma Solutions.[10]
After 2007 and Initial Public Offering[edit]
In 2011, the Company acquired the molecular optimization platform OptiForm®, from GlaxoSmithKline.[11] In 2012, Catalent acquired Aptuit, a clinical supply solutions company. As part of the deal, Catalent gained three sites in the United States, two sites in the United Kingdom and one in Singapore.[12] Catalent also acquired all remaining shares for the R.P Scherer site in Eberbach, Germany.[6] In 2013, Catalent Pharmaceutical Solutions continued the global expansion of its Softgel capabilities through a joint venture with Zhejiang Jaing Yuan Tang Biotechnology Co., a China-based company, and Relthy Laboratories in Brazil.[13] Also in 2013, Catalent created a new business unit, Advanced Delivery Technologies which focuses on innovative and proven drug delivery technologies, optimizing the company’s multiple technologies, cross-platform R&D solutions and global commercial manufacturing network.[14] This is the current structure of Catalent’s business which includes softgel technologies, advanced delivery technologies and development & clinical services business units.
Catalent announced its initial public offering on July 30, 2014. After raising more than $870 million, Catalent became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[15] The company priced its 42.5 million shares of common stock at $20.50 apiece, with a market capitalization of $2.4 billion. The shares began trading on the NYSE on July 31, 2014, under the ticker symbol CTLT, and the offering closed on August 1, 2014.[15] The proceeds of the offering went to the redemption of more than $800 million of Catalent’s outstanding debt. “This will allow the company to significantly reduce its interest expense, enable future potential internal and external growth strategies, and to continue our growth-biased investments into new technologies, capabilities, global development and manufacturing facilities and capacity,” a company statement reported.[16]
In September 2016, the company acquired the contract drug development and clinical manufacturing company, which specializes in early stage development and spray drying: Pharmatek Laboratories.[17]
In November 2016, the company agreed to acquire Canadian based Accucaps Industries. Both the Strathroy, ON and Windsor, ON locations will become the 12th and 13th Softgel Technology Facilities under the Catalent name.[18]

History[edit]
Before 2007[edit]
In 1996, Cardinal Health acquired PCI (Headquarters: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania).[4] PCI (Packaging Coordinators Inc.) is a pharmaceutical contract packing service for commercial and clinical packaging.[5] In 1998, Cardinal Health acquired R.P. Scherer Corporation (Headquarters: Troy, Michigan).[6] Robert Pauli Scherer founded the R.P. Scherer Corporation to commercialize his innovation of softgel encapsulation using the rotary die production process.[7] In 1999, Cardinal Health acquired Automatic Liquid Packaging, Inc. (Headquarters: Woodstock, Ill.),[4] whose Blow-Fill-Seal Technology allowed Cardinal to enter the sterile product market.[7] Cardinal Health also acquired International Processing Corporation (Headquarters: Winchester, Kentucky) for its advanced controlled drug release and coating manufacturing expertise.[8]
In 2002, Cardinal Health acquired Magellan Laboratories Inc., a company that specialized in product development expertise.[4] In 2003, Cardinal Health acquired Gala Biotech (Headquarters: Middleton, Wisconsin).[4] Gala Biotech had established technologies surrounding gene insertion and the production of pharmaceutical proteins, which became GPEx® Technology.[9] In the same year, Cardinal Health also acquired Intercare Group PLC, broadening its global capabilities in Europe.[4] In 2004-2006, Cardinal Health further expanded its reach in biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets through multiple other acquisitions.[4]
Formation of Catalent in 2007[edit]
In 2007, the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment of Cardinal Health was purchased by Blackstone Group and re-branded as Catalent Pharma Solutions.[10]
After 2007 and Initial Public Offering[edit]
In 2011, the Company acquired the molecular optimization platform OptiForm®, from GlaxoSmithKline.[11] In 2012, Catalent acquired Aptuit, a clinical supply solutions company. As part of the deal, Catalent gained three sites in the United States, two sites in the United Kingdom and one in Singapore.[12] Catalent also acquired all remaining shares for the R.P Scherer site in Eberbach, Germany.[6] In 2013, Catalent Pharmaceutical Solutions continued the global expansion of its Softgel capabilities through a joint venture with Zhejiang Jaing Yuan Tang Biotechnology Co., a China-based company, and Relthy Laboratories in Brazil.[13] Also in 2013, Catalent created a new business unit, Advanced Delivery Technologies which focuses on innovative and proven drug delivery technologies, optimizing the company’s multiple technologies, cross-platform R&D solutions and global commercial manufacturing network.[14] This is the current structure of Catalent’s business which includes softgel technologies, advanced delivery technologies and development & clinical services business units.
Catalent announced its initial public offering on July 30, 2014. After raising more than $870 million, Catalent became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[15] The company priced its 42.5 million shares of common stock at $20.50 apiece, with a market capitalization of $2.4 billion. The shares began trading on the NYSE on July 31, 2014, under the ticker symbol CTLT, and the offering closed on August 1, 2014.[15] The proceeds of the offering went to the redemption of more than $800 million of Catalent’s outstanding debt. “This will allow the company to significantly reduce its interest expense, enable future potential internal and external growth strategies, and to continue our growth-biased investments into new technologies, capabilities, global development and manufacturing facilities and capacity,” a company statement reported.[16]
In September 2016, the company acquired the contract drug development and clinical manufacturing company, which specializes in early stage development and spray drying: Pharmatek Laboratories.[17]
In November 2016, the company agreed to acquire Canadian based Accucaps Industries. Both the Strathroy, ON and Windsor, ON locations will become the 12th and 13th Softgel Technology Facilities under the Catalent name.[18]

After raising more than $870 million, Catalent became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[15] The company priced its 42.5 million shares of common stock at $20.50 apiece, with a market capitalization of $2.4 billion. The shares began trading on the NYSE on July 31, 2014, under the ticker symbol CTLT, and the offering closed on August 1, 2014.[15] The proceeds of the offering went to the redemption of more than $800 million of Catalent’s outstanding debt. “This will allow the company to significantly reduce its interest expense, enable future potential internal and external growth strategies, and to continue our growth-biased investments into new technologies, capabilities, global development and manufacturing facilities and capacity,” a company statement reported.[16]
In September 2016, the company acquired the contract drug development and clinical manufacturing company, which specializes in early stage development and spray drying: Pharmatek Laboratories.[17]
In November 2016, the company agreed to acquire Canadian based Accucaps Industries. Both the Strathroy, ON and Windsor, ON locations will become the 12th and 13th Softgel Technology Facilities under the Catalent name.[18]

History[edit]
Before 2007[edit]
In 1996, Cardinal Health acquired PCI (Headquarters: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania).[4] PCI (Packaging Coordinators Inc.) is a pharmaceutical contract packing service for commercial and clinical packaging.[5] In 1998, Cardinal Health acquired R.P. Scherer Corporation (Headquarters: Troy, Michigan).[6] Robert Pauli Scherer founded the R.P. Scherer Corporation to commercialize his innovation of softgel encapsulation using the rotary die production process.[7] In 1999, Cardinal Health acquired Automatic Liquid Packaging, Inc. (Headquarters: Woodstock, Ill.),[4] whose Blow-Fill-Seal Technology allowed Cardinal to enter the sterile product market.[7] Cardinal Health also acquired International Processing Corporation (Headquarters: Winchester, Kentucky) for its advanced controlled drug release and coating manufacturing expertise.[8]
In 2002, Cardinal Health acquired Magellan Laboratories Inc., a company that specialized in product development expertise.[4] In 2003, Cardinal Health acquired Gala Biotech (Headquarters: Middleton, Wisconsin).[4] Gala Biotech had established technologies surrounding gene insertion and the production of pharmaceutical proteins, which became GPEx® Technology.[9] In the same year, Cardinal Health also acquired Intercare Group PLC, broadening its global capabilities in Europe.[4] In 2004-2006, Cardinal Health further expanded its reach in biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets through multiple other acquisitions.[4]
Formation of Catalent in 2007[edit]
In 2007, the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment of Cardinal Health was purchased by Blackstone Group and re-branded as Catalent Pharma Solutions.[10]
After 2007 and Initial Public Offering[edit]
In 2011, the Company acquired the molecular optimization platform OptiForm®, from GlaxoSmithKline.[11] In 2012, Catalent acquired Aptuit, a clinical supply solutions company. As part of the deal, Catalent gained three sites in the United States, two sites in the United Kingdom and one in Singapore.[12] Catalent also acquired all remaining shares for the R.P Scherer site in Eberbach, Germany.[6] In 2013, Catalent Pharmaceutical Solutions continued the global expansion of its Softgel capabilities through a joint venture with Zhejiang Jaing Yuan Tang Biotechnology Co., a China-based company, and Relthy Laboratories in Brazil.[13] Also in 2013, Catalent created a new business unit, Advanced Delivery Technologies which focuses on innovative and proven drug delivery technologies, optimizing the company’s multiple technologies, cross-platform R&D solutions and global commercial manufacturing network.[14] This is the current structure of Catalent’s business which includes softgel technologies, advanced delivery technologies and development & clinical services business units.
Catalent announced its initial public offering on July 30, 2014. After raising more than $870 million, Catalent became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[15] The company priced its 42.5 million shares of common stock at $20.50 apiece, with a market capitalization of $2.4 billion. The shares began trading on the NYSE on July 31, 2014, under the ticker symbol CTLT, and the offering closed on August 1, 2014.[15] The proceeds of the offering went to the redemption of more than $800 million of Catalent’s outstanding debt. “This will allow the company to significantly reduce its interest expense, enable future potential internal and external growth strategies, and to continue our growth-biased investments into new technologies, capabilities, global development and manufacturing facilities and capacity,” a company statement reported.[16]
In September 2016, the company acquired the contract drug development and clinical manufacturing company, which specializes in early stage development and spray drying: Pharmatek Laboratories.[17]
In November 2016, the company agreed to acquire Canadian based Accucaps Industries. Both the Strathroy, ON and Windsor, ON locations will become the 12th and 13th Softgel Technology Facilities under the Catalent name.[18]

After 2007 and Initial Public Offering[edit]
In 2011, the Company acquired the molecular optimization platform OptiForm®, from GlaxoSmithKline.[11] In 2012, Catalent acquired Aptuit, a clinical supply solutions company. As part of the deal, Catalent gained three sites in the United States, two sites in the United Kingdom and one in Singapore.[12] Catalent also acquired all remaining shares for the R.P Scherer site in Eberbach, Germany.[6] In 2013, Catalent Pharmaceutical Solutions continued the global expansion of its Softgel capabilities through a joint venture with Zhejiang Jaing Yuan Tang Biotechnology Co., a China-based company, and Relthy Laboratories in Brazil.[13] Also in 2013, Catalent created a new business unit, Advanced Delivery Technologies which focuses on innovative and proven drug delivery technologies, optimizing the company’s multiple technologies, cross-platform R&D solutions and global commercial manufacturing network.[14] This is the current structure of Catalent’s business which includes softgel technologies, advanced delivery technologies and development & clinical services business units.
Catalent announced its initial public offering on July 30, 2014. After raising more than $870 million, Catalent became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[15] The company priced its 42.5 million shares of common stock at $20.50 apiece, with a market capitalization of $2.4 billion. The shares began trading on the NYSE on July 31, 2014, under the ticker symbol CTLT, and the offering closed on August 1, 2014.[15] The proceeds of the offering went to the redemption of more than $800 million of Catalent’s outstanding debt. “This will allow the company to significantly reduce its interest expense, enable future potential internal and external growth strategies, and to continue our growth-biased investments into new technologies, capabilities, global development and manufacturing facilities and capacity,” a company statement reported.[16]
In September 2016, the company acquired the contract drug development and clinical manufacturing company, which specializes in early stage development and spray drying: Pharmatek Laboratories.[17]
In November 2016, the company agreed to acquire Canadian based Accucaps Industries. Both the Strathroy, ON and Windsor, ON locations will become the 12th and 13th Softgel Technology Facilities under the Catalent name.[18]

History[edit]
Before 2007[edit]
In 1996, Cardinal Health acquired PCI (Headquarters: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania).[4] PCI (Packaging Coordinators Inc.) is a pharmaceutical contract packing service for commercial and clinical packaging.[5] In 1998, Cardinal Health acquired R.P. Scherer Corporation (Headquarters: Troy, Michigan).[6] Robert Pauli Scherer founded the R.P. Scherer Corporation to commercialize his innovation of softgel encapsulation using the rotary die production process.[7] In 1999, Cardinal Health acquired Automatic Liquid Packaging, Inc. (Headquarters: Woodstock, Ill.),[4] whose Blow-Fill-Seal Technology allowed Cardinal to enter the sterile product market.[7] Cardinal Health also acquired International Processing Corporation (Headquarters: Winchester, Kentucky) for its advanced controlled drug release and coating manufacturing expertise.[8]
In 2002, Cardinal Health acquired Magellan Laboratories Inc., a company that specialized in product development expertise.[4] In 2003, Cardinal Health acquired Gala Biotech (Headquarters: Middleton, Wisconsin).[4] Gala Biotech had established technologies surrounding gene insertion and the production of pharmaceutical proteins, which became GPEx® Technology.[9] In the same year, Cardinal Health also acquired Intercare Group PLC, broadening its global capabilities in Europe.[4] In 2004-2006, Cardinal Health further expanded its reach in biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets through multiple other acquisitions.[4]
Formation of Catalent in 2007[edit]
In 2007, the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment of Cardinal Health was purchased by Blackstone Group and re-branded as Catalent Pharma Solutions.[10]
After 2007 and Initial Public Offering[edit]
In 2011, the Company acquired the molecular optimization platform OptiForm®, from GlaxoSmithKline.[11] In 2012, Catalent acquired Aptuit, a clinical supply solutions company. As part of the deal, Catalent gained three sites in the United States, two sites in the United Kingdom and one in Singapore.[12] Catalent also acquired all remaining shares for the R.P Scherer site in Eberbach, Germany.[6] In 2013, Catalent Pharmaceutical Solutions continued the global expansion of its Softgel capabilities through a joint venture with Zhejiang Jaing Yuan Tang Biotechnology Co., a China-based company, and Relthy Laboratories in Brazil.[13] Also in 2013, Catalent created a new business unit, Advanced Delivery Technologies which focuses on innovative and proven drug delivery technologies, optimizing the company’s multiple technologies, cross-platform R&D solutions and global commercial manufacturing network.[14] This is the current structure of Catalent’s business which includes softgel technologies, advanced delivery technologies and development & clinical services business units.
Catalent announced its initial public offering on July 30, 2014. After raising more than $870 million, Catalent became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[15] The company priced its 42.5 million shares of common stock at $20.50 apiece, with a market capitalization of $2.4 billion. The shares began trading on the NYSE on July 31, 2014, under the ticker symbol CTLT, and the offering closed on August 1, 2014.[15] The proceeds of the offering went to the redemption of more than $800 million of Catalent’s outstanding debt. “This will allow the company to significantly reduce its interest expense, enable future potential internal and external growth strategies, and to continue our growth-biased investments into new technologies, capabilities, global development and manufacturing facilities and capacity,” a company statement reported.[16]
In September 2016, the company acquired the contract drug development and clinical manufacturing company, which specializes in early stage development and spray drying: Pharmatek Laboratories.[17]
In November 2016, the company agreed to acquire Canadian based Accucaps Industries. Both the Strathroy, ON and Windsor, ON locations will become the 12th and 13th Softgel Technology Facilities under the Catalent name.[18]
