Harnessing ESG for Performance and Sustainability

OWLESG is a domestic equity index with a high correlation to popular large-cap benchmarks. This innovative index weights constituents by ESG scores — not by market-cap — to aim more capital to responsible companies.
LEARN MORE











ESG-Weighting 
for Wiser Investing
ESG data measures how well a company manages their material risks and opportunities. This creates a useful picture of their environmental footprint, stakeholder relationships, and governance habits.









ESG is Material:

Over 2,000 studies show a clear link between ESG scores and outperformance, particularly across longer timeframes.





ESG is Industry Specific: 

Each industry is judged on its own set of ESG issues, based on materiality. Scores illustrate how well a company manages the ESG issues relevant to their line of business.





ESG Creates Impact:

Companies with higher ESG scores reduce their environmental footprint, benefit all stakeholders, and govern themselves responsibly to protect shareholders.









TAKING ESG MAINSTREAM
OWLshares designs mainstream products that are ESG-optimized. Investors — even those seeking sustainable products — want the peace of mind of familiar asset classes, styles, and sectors that can easily fit existing portfolios and investment models.






Enhanced Performance
Reach for enhanced returns. A goal of ESG-weighting is to outperform benchmarks by driving more capital to companies employing sustainable business practices.





Sustainable & Impactful
Make an impact. OWLshares indices allocate more capital to companies that are better corporate citizens.





Advanced Data
Harness data. OWL ESG is leading the evolution of sustainability metrics. Scores built on the broadest available set of data offer more materiality for investment applications.









Insights & Resources
Why do institutional investors the world over use ESG?
A significant portion of institutional money managers use ESG research to make investment decisions. They know that ESG provides deeper insight into portfolio risks and opportunities.

ESG OPTIMIZATION
OWL ESG proprietary technology builds on the benefits previously achieved using ESG. Reducing subjectivity at all levels of the ratings process elevates ESG to a foundation principle for all stock selection.








More ESG Issues

OWL ESG rates companies on the broadest set of industry accepted ESG issues, providing a more complete ESG picture of every company scored.





More Data

OWL ESG leverages the largest ESG data set in the industry, gathered from corporate disclosures and filings, news sources, NGOs, research firms, and more.





Consensus Model

OWL ESG creates a multi-viewpoint model by incorporating industry-specific ESG issue recommendations from the leading ESG standards organizations.





Objective Optimization

OWL ESG statistically optimizes multiple viewpoints, effectively creating a best-of-the-best ESG consensus for every company scored.

About • OWLshares
























































































About Us
New wisdom for better investments and 
a better world.






COMMITMENT TO IMPACT
Every person has the power to create positive change for their family, for their community, and for the world.
OWLshares is the only index provider founded completely in sustainability — it is the very root of our business, not just a branch. It's been said that all investments have impact; the power of the market means every dollar you invest will make a difference. We want our impact to be positive. At OWLshares, every index's constituents are weighted by their ESG score, with the goal of allocating the lion's share of investment dollars to good corporate citizens.











RAISING THE STANDARD
With thousands of studies tying higher ESG scores to better performance, it's hard to imagine that anybody would make investment decisions without incorporating the data. But familiar benchmark indices weight their constituents using old standards — factors like cap-weighting or revenue-weighting — strategies with no consistent correlation to lower risk or higher return.

OWLshares imagines a future where all investors will understand the value of ESG. Investment strategies will eventually incorporate this data by default, or they'll fall behind. Those who discover how to harness ESG now will forge new benchmarks. And companies competing for index allocations will find even more advantage in keeping a clean house.

OWLshares builds responsible, sustainable, and impactful indices that fit into familiar and comfortable categories. Investors can easily apply our indices and methodologies to investment models and existing portfolios.









The OWLshares Difference
OWLshares ESG-optimized ETFs vs  other ESG-themed products

Subjective, inconsistent, or arbitrary application of ESG

Frequently Asked Questions







Why is OWLshares unique?



Our mission is to create financial products that help people and the planet. It’s not an afterthought; it’s not an alternative. It’s our core strategy, and we’re fiercely proud of it.
We believe investors don’t have to sacrifice financial returns to make a positive impact on the world. Every index or product we offer — or will ever offer — will aim for both sustainability and financial return.
OWLshares believes that financial markets constitute one of the greatest mechanisms for creating positive change — not just for investors, but for the world at large. OWLshares wants to help make that benefit and that power as widely accessible as possible, and wants to see concerned investors extend their reach and impact.






How does OWLshares benefit investors?



OWLshares’ proprietary ESG scores, based on the most thorough data set available, can be used to ESG-optimize any investment strategy. OWLshares indices will allow a wide range of investors the opportunity to upgrade common portfolio asset categories to ESG-optimized versions. This allows investors to allocate capital to securities they already use while at the same time diverting a greater portion of the capital to better corporate citizens, helping make a positive impact on society and the world.






What is ESG?



ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. Usually ESG refers to data about how a company manages their environmental footprint, how fairly a company interacts with their social ecosystem, and how well a company governs itself to protect shareholders. ESG can also refer to scores or ratings based on that data, or to investment strategies that incorporate any of the above.
Related: Five steps to become an E-S-Genius, The natural history of ESG






Why is ESG important?



ESG data provides remarkable insight into the risks and opportunities of investing in a specific company. Companies that reduce their ESG risks are on the whole more sustainable than their lower-scored peers; more sustainable companies will generally financially outperform their peers over time. The data unequivocally supports this conclusion, which is why institutional investors have been consulting ESG data vendors for years to analyze their investments.
Additionally, ESG can help identify those companies which behave as better corporate citizens — those who minimize their environmental footprint, treat employees and other stakeholders fairly, and operate with honesty and transparency.
Combining this elevated sustainability with ESG’s potential to enhance performance is a powerful tool to allocate investment dollars more positively. We want to improve the world now, for our children, and for future generations, and believe ESG-optimized investment products have the unique power of aligning self-interest with helping the world. The profit motive can help deploy capital for wider beneficial impact.
Related: Five steps to become an E-S-Genius, The natural history of ESG






How does ESG relate to investing?



One word: Materiality. Each of the literally hundreds of ESG issues represents an opportunity for a company to reduce risk, increase profit, or both. Every industry has its own set of ESG issues specific to the operation of that industry’s businesses. ESG reporting, research, and analysis work toward the goal of helping businesses operate better and grow for long term success.
Related: ESG is not an investment strategy, Five steps to become an E-S-Genius






What is SRI?



Sustainable, responsible, and impact investing means investment strategies that consider ESG factors with the goal of financial return and positive social impact. When used to stand for socially responsible investing (a term used less and less frequently), it has often meant screening out companies or industries deemed by some to be harmful to society, but we use it only in the first sense.

What is impact investing?



Impact investments invest in companies, organizations, and funds with the goal of generating social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.

As a responsible investor, do I have to sacrifice returns?



Thousands of studies have shown a clear link between ESG scores and corporate financial performance. In the majority of cases, ESG properly applied should enhance returns over the long term.

Read More  







Where do ESG scores come from?



ESG scores are primarily generated by research companies like OWLshares. We create proprietary ESG scores that cover the majority of public companies. Most ESG research firms employ a team of analysts that comb through sources (including company filings, voluntary corporate social responsibility disclosures, consultants, news media, NGOs, watchdog groups, and other public information sources) to rate how companies are managing their ESG issues. 
These issues have been developed and proposed by standards boards, public interest groups who research how industries and businesses interact with their stakeholders and the planet.

Read More  







Why doesn’t everyone use ESG data?



There are some challenges to using ESG well, though they’re clearly outweighed by the benefits.

      On the whole, each ESG research provider only rates a limited universe of companies. So, if you work with only one source, you may not have access to data on all the companies you’re analyzing.
      Every ESG ratings provider has its own ratings methodology, which is subjective on many levels.
      Each provider chooses which industry-specific ESG issues to use in forming their ratings; it’s common for an under 60% overlap between which issues each research company deems important for each industry.
      Each provider creates its own weighting plan for those issues. Rightfully, they weight more important issues more heavily, but this increases the ratings divergence.
      Each provider chooses and uses ESG data in different ways; each analyzes and interprets it differently. This is a great source of subjectivity
      Ratings companies looking at the same data report vastly different ratings.
     Each ESG ratings provider charges a steep fee to access the ESG data, and thorough investors often need to consult more than one vendor.

Related: Does ESG have an image problem?, The natural history of ESG, ESG is not an investment strategy






If ESG data is inherently subjective, how can I rely on any of it?



The challenge of using ESG is mostly due to subjective selection of what ESG data to use and how to apply it when analyzing whether to invest in a company. These same challenges exist in other methods of fundamental investment research. For instance, analysts give different weight to standard metrics (like price-to-earning, sales growth, management experience), but each of these points is still valuable alone or taken as a whole. 
Like all of these metrics, all ESG research provides valuable insights into how a company is managing their material risks and opportunities. Undoubtedly, more data and more analysis is better than less; some data and some analysis is better than none.
Related: ESG is not an investment strategy, Does ESG have an image problem?, Five steps to become an E-S-Genius






If ESG itself is so valuable, why do some ESG-themed indices and funds underperform their benchmarks in certain periods?



Simply put, ESG is merely data. Good data is a powerful tool in the investor’s toolbox, but it needs to be wielded properly for good results. Existing ESG-themed indices and funds all apply ESG in different ways, and heavily employ exclusionary tactics. As a result, those products are not an effective gauge of ESG’s effect on performance.
Companies that focus on their ESG performance are generally better managed, with processes and procedures that promote the long-term viability of their businesses. That said, ESG-related practices are only a subset of what builds value in a company. There will always be short-term reasons why companies with lower ESG scores may outperform — e.g., the release of a new product, strong marketing, temporary cost-cutting, market psychology, and so on.
Over the long term, we believe consistency is a stronger strategy. Higher-rated companies that adopt accountable and repeatable processes exhibit operational excellence.
Related: Does ESG have an image problem?, ESG is not an investment strategy






How can I use ESG for investing?



Most individual investors have limited options for using ESG in their investment decisions. High net worth individuals and institutions may pay for access to ESG data, hire a sustainability consultant to create a suitable portfolio, or even engage the services of an index provider to create a fund for their institution or like-minded investors.
Retail investors can choose from an increasing number of ESG-themed ETFs or other funds. Not every fund will suit every investor’s tastes; read the prospectus carefully to understand how the index is determined, how the methodology affects exposure and diversification, and what risks that entails. Few ESG-themed funds have achieved mainstream status, many struggling against the market’s perceptions of what can be seen as a niche product. But as ESG gains traction and is better understood, funds which include ESG considerations will become more mainstream.
Related: Five steps to become an E-S-Genius, What’s an ETF?






What happens if ESG standards change again? Could that affect index performance?



Not if, but when. ESG standards continue to evolve. As the ESG industry has developed, standards organizations have focused more and more on ESG issues that are material to company performance; they and the ESG research companies continue to perfect their craft. 
We believe these trends will continue. While there is always the chance that new standards will cause a temporary shift in relative ESG scores, responsible companies on the whole will continue to respond and rise to the top. 
We believe an index based on evolving standards should likewise improve over time.

How do you pick the stocks in your index?



OWLshares is not an active manager and does not pick stocks.  As a company, we are launching passive indices that fit into familiar asset classes such as large cap, small cap, value, growth, and others. They are designed to provide a broad access to these popular asset classes while using  passive and transparent rules to create familiar and attractive investment profiles similar to common benchmarks.
 
Read More  







Why don’t you weight your index by market-cap or revenue?



Our indices weight constituents by ESG score. This takes advantage of data which, by its very nature, can reveal companies’ operational excellence and sustainability. We consider ESG a better indicator of suitability for weighting than traditional weighting methods.
 
Read More  







Why don’t you eliminate low-scoring companies or disagreeable industries from your index?



Our mission is to identify companies that do a better job managing their ESG risks and opportunities, independent of industry or business model. These companies show better long-term viability compared to their peers. They actively work to reduce their environmental footprint, operate their businesses in a socially conscious fashion, and manage themselves with strong governance. This makes the world a better place. 
Our inclusive strategy maintains good market exposure, reducing risks inherent in strategies that screen certain industries or companies. By weighting our index in favor of higher ESG scores, we reward good behavior; by reweighting as we update scores, we reward improvement.
Related: Should we divest?, Sustainable activism






Won’t the inclusion of certain stocks alienate some conscious-minded investors?



Other approaches may be exclusionary, or may selectively omit entire industries or classes of equity. This has led to the availability of many bespoke indices or niche theme funds. 
Our approach is to weight index constituents by their ESG score, elevating the concept of ESG to a foundation principle for all stock selection. We see this as the pure application of ESG. This approach rewards sustainability and improvement. We feel this is the strongest strategy to invest responsibly.

Important Information

 

This information must be preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. Investors should read it carefully before investing.


iShares Silver Trust (the “Silver Trust”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents the Silver Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting www.iShares.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Silver Trust will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-800-474-2737. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Because shares of the Trust are intended to reflect the price of the silver held by the Trust, the market price of the shares is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting silver prices. Additionally, shares of the Trust are bought and sold at market price, not at net asset value ("NAV"). Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Shares of the Trust are intended to reflect, at any given time, the market price of silver owned by the Trust at that time less the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The price received upon the sale of shares of the Trust, which trade at market price, may be more or less than the value of the silver represented by such shares. If an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists, such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares. For a more complete discussion of risk factors relative to the Trust, carefully read the prospectus. Following an investment in the Trust, several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of silver and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares. Among them: (i) A change in economic conditions, such as a recession, can adversely affect the price of silver. Silver is used in a wide range of industrial applications, and an economic downturn could have a negative impact on its demand and, consequently, its price and the price of the shares. (ii) A significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards silver. Should the speculative community take a negative view towards silver, a decline in world silver prices could occur, negatively impacting the price of the shares. (iii) A significant increase in silver price hedging activity by silver producers. Traditionally, silver producers have not hedged to the same extent as other producers of precious metals (gold, for example) do. Should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of silver producing companies, it could cause a decline in world silver prices, adversely affecting the price of the shares. Silver Spot Prices provided by The Bullion Desk. No warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon. Prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the internet. Prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades. Although shares of the Trust may be bought or sold on the secondary market through any brokerage account, shares are not redeemable except in large aggregated units called "Baskets". Only registered broker-dealers that become authorized participants by entering into a contract with the sponsor and the trustee of the Trust may purchase or redeem Baskets. The amount of silver represented by shares of the Trust will decrease over the life of the Trust due to sales of silver necessary to pay the sponsor's fee and Trust expenses. Without increases in the price of silver sufficient to compensate for that decrease, the price of the shares will also decline, and investors will lose money on their investment in the shares. The Trust will have limited duration. The liquidation of the trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the trust's silver will result in losses to investors. Although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the NAV and the trading price of Trust shares through arbitrage opportunities, there is no guarantee that they will do so. There is no guarantee an active trading market will develop for the shares, which may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares. The value of the shares of the Trust will be adversely affected if silver owned by the trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the Trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss. Shares of the Trust are not deposits or other obligations of or guaranteed by BlackRock, Inc., and its affiliates. An investment in the Trust is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency and its return and yield will fluctuate with market conditions. When comparing commodities and the Trust, it should be remembered that the sponsor's fee associated with the Trust is not borne by investors in individual commodities. Buying and selling shares of the Trust will result in brokerage commissions. Because the expenses involved in an investment in physical silver will be dispersed among all holders of shares of the Trust, an investment in the Trust may represent a cost-efficient alternative to investments in silver for investors not otherwise able to participate directly in the market for physical silver. Net Asset Value (NAV) is determined as specified in the prospectus: the iShares Silver Trust's silver and other assets are valued on the basis of each day's announced LBMA Silver Price, the price of an ounce of silver based on electronic, auction-based platform from CME Group and Thomson Reuters, minus all accrued fees, expenses and liabilities.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation.

Not Your Grandfather’s Market: The Evolution of Liquid Alternatives






Alpha Hunters, Alternative Mutual Funds, Liquid Alts, Retail Investing 

        05 Oct 2014	   
    




By Andrew Smith, CAIA
Liquid alternative investments have exploded over the past decade. Post 2007-2009 financial crisis individual investors, their advisors, and institutional investors alike sought investment opportunities to provide risk diversification, return enhancement and inflation hedging characteristics without sacrificing liquidity or transparency. Many investors, both professional and individual, believe that liquid alternatives are a new commodity; however they have been around for quite some time. It is true that the explosive growth in alternative mutual and exchange traded funds has largely taken place over the past half-decade or so, but the liquid alternative market, as a whole, is much broader than simply alternative mutual and exchange traded funds. Liquid alternatives, by definition, are any investment funds that are tradable, on a daily or intraday basis, that provide investors’ exposure to assets that fall outside the traditional “box” of stocks, bonds & cash.
When past generations wanted to make investments, they had very few options. Publicly listed stocks or bonds, bank products such as CDs, cash like investments such as money market funds, and private investment opportunities. The final being high risk, typically carrying no liquidity, no transparency, and the need for expertise in the sector. Over the past 4 decades there have been vast strides made to bring alternative investments such as real estate, commodities, active investment funds, private equity funds, and non-traditional real estate holdings such as oil & gas properties, farmland, timberland, etc. to the mainstream public, in a liquid, regulated, transparent package.
While the investment company act of 1940 has long allowed for the creation, operation, marketing and thus investment in mutual funds that provide alternative asset exposure, the first Liquid Alternative Funds to gain traction were Publicly Listed Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs. REITs began being offered at the end of the 1950s, however they were widely unknown investment opportunities. In 1971 there were only 34 REITs in total, carrying assets under management, as measured by market capitalization, of $1.494 Billion. Since the 1970s, the REIT market has grown 60-fold in AUM to over $670 billion in total AUM, and 6-fold in number of REITs offered to 202 in 2013, according to NAREIT. Other real estate opportunities have gained popularity as well, such as Timberland Investment Management Organizations (TIMOs), though not nearly the popularity of REITs. Below are two charts, first showing the growth in the number of listed REITs, followed by one showing growth in AUM of REITs.


Listed REITs offer investors exposure to the vast, global, real estate market, with intraday tradability. Listed REITs also offer investors, who seek real estate exposure, professional asset management. The demand for liquid real estate exposure was, and remains elevated, particularly after the lack of liquidity and lumpiness of private real estate ownership burned a large number of real estate investors in the 2007-2009 financial crises. As mentioned earlier, other investment opportunities in real estate, or real assets for a broader definition, have long existed, only recently to garner popularity in a liquid, transparent, regulated and accessible package.
Oil and gas opportunities have always intrigued investors, as the demand, globally, for energy commodities have, and will continue to increase as the world develops. Dependency on fossil fuels creates an opportunity to generate healthy returns, with inflation hedging characteristics. Publicly listed Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) have made these opportunities accessible to all investors. The Listed MLP market has exploded over the past 2 decades, and particularly since the financial crisis of 2007-2009. In 2000, there were only 20 listed MLPs, with a total AUM, measured by market capitalization, of $16billion. At the beginning of 2014, that market had grown to over 120 MLPs with over $590 Billion in AUM. Since 2008, AUM in MLPs, which bottomed at $89billion, has grown more than 6-fold and the number of funds has increased by over 75%, from 68 at the end of 2008, to current levels.

There are a number of reasons for the explosive growth in this market, however the two most compelling are the inflation hedging benefits and the tax-advantaged status of the MLP vehicle. Listed MLPs are one of the best inflation hedges, providing investors both an infrastructure and commodity exposure. Listed MLPs distribute a lot of cash, as a mandate of their existence, providing investors a stable income investment opportunity, but they also carry significant tax advantages, and with the majority of current US investors entering, or getting close to their retirement tax advantaged income is in high demand. Factors, such as diversification, liquidity and transparency in a market that previously had little opportunity to diversify due to very few funds with high minimum investments, no liquidity, and a significant lack of transparency add to the appeal of listed MLPs, and have drawn individual investors, investment advisors, and institutional investors to increase their allocations to listed MLPs. The charts above highlight this demand in a visual format.
 
Liquid alternative investment opportunities are not confined to the real estate/real asset sectors. The private equity market, a traditionally highly complex and non-transparent asset class with virtually no liquidity, has begun its shift into the liquid alternative space with the listing, increased awareness towards, and growing popularity of Business Development Companies (BDCs). Listed BDCs are the first publicly listed private equity funds, accessible by individual and institutional investors alike. While not all BDCs are listed, many more are choosing a public stock exchange as an outlet to not only raise capital and garner a public valuation, but offer investors liquidity and transparency.
BDCs are not as broad of a private equity exposure as many investors would like, focusing mostly on middle market growth companies that are preparing for strategic sale of public offering, however it is an exposure to private equity, particularly for those investors that have been shunned from the market due to high minimum investments and investor qualification rules. The listed BDC market is young, and still growing, but just since 2008, the number of listed BDCs has nearly doubled, and the assets under management in the listed BDCs has nearly tripled. BDCs are the liquid alternative to private structure private equity funds, and are a liquid alternative investment, offering liquid exposure to private equity through public stock exchanges.
Below are two charts, the first shows the growth in the number of listed BDCs in 2008 and again in 2013, the second highlights the growth in listed BDC assets under management.

As can clearly be seen, the number of, the popularity of and the awareness towards listed BDCs as a liquid private equity fund has grown significantly, and likely will continue to, as institutional investors intend to increase their private equity allocations to nearly double their current level by 2030, according to Preqin.
Liquid alternatives serve a useful purpose in both the individual and institutional portfolio. As discussed in this posting, Real Estate, Real Assets & Private Equity has become significantly more accessible with the listing of REITs, MLPs and BDCs, however, most non-institutional investors have also suffered from a lack of exposure to actively managed alternative investment funds that employ sophisticated trading strategies, developed and operated by “Wall Street” professionals with significant knowledge. These funds, commonly known as hedge funds, have always lacked accessibility, carried high minimum investments, complex fee structures, and only provided liquidity when the manager of said funds was willing. Both Pre & Post financial crisis, investors in hedge funds sought better alternatives, the alternative mutual and exchange traded fund business exploded. Alternative mutual & exchange traded funds offer investors exposure in actively managed, long/short commodity, equities, & fixed income strategies, domestically, region specific and/or globally. There is a broad range of various strategies, whether simply value oriented and actively managed, or focused on a specific situation such as merger arbitrage, or some other specialty. In 2003 there was only $9billion in AUM in alternative mutual funds & ETFs, by 2008 it had grown 10 fold, at the end of 2012, total AUM in alternative mutual funds & ETFs reached over $300billion. This chart demonstrates the enormous growth in popularity of these liquid alternative funds.

As has been detailed throughout this post, investors today have the ability to build a truly diversified portfolio, gaining exposure to asset classes such as real estate, real assets (oil & gas land, timberland, commodities, infrastructure), private equity & hedge funds, without sacrificing the liquidity of their portfolio. Capital markets today are far more competitive than they were when our parents and grandparents were building their wealth through investing. For generations, the only investment options were stocks, bonds, bank products, cash-like investments such as money market funds, and private investment deals. This presented a massive challenge to the average investors attempting to build a diversified, long-term portfolio, particularly maintaining a high level of liquidity. Today, there is no excuse, whether you’re an individual investor, retail advisor, or institutional investor, for maintaining a portfolio that lacks asset or strategy diversification. There are many options that provide investors the ability to expose their portfolio to a broad spectrum of both traditional and alternative assets, as well as traditional and alternative strategies. Here in the new millennium, capital markets have evolved, and the inclusion of liquid alternative strategies allow investors of all size and sophistication to take a long-term diversified asset allocation approach, building a stable portfolio focused on delivering returns, minimizing risk, and meeting the goals of the portfolio.
The evolution of the liquid alternatives market has been significant, beginning in the late 1950s, investors have seen the continuous addition of new opportunities that provide new asset and strategy exposure, and have, for the most part, taken advantage of such opportunities. Investors that have not yet participated in these new opportunities have not missed out. It is not too late for investors of all sizes to take advantage of liquid alternatives. It would be prudent of all investors to seek advice from a professional, or conduct adequate research to determine the best way to include liquid alternative opportunities in their portfolio. The growth in this market is expected to continue and new products seemingly emerge every month. While traditional investments still serve their purpose within the portfolio, it will become increasingly important, as markets become increasingly efficient from an information standpoint, to utilize alternatives if seeking to outperform or stabilize returns when investing. Liquid alternatives will likely become the preferred option for all investors, as they have already for so many. It is likely that liquid alternatives will replace the private structure funds of old, if not entirely, significantly, due to the increase in transparency and the ability to redeem funds quickly and easily, as needed.
