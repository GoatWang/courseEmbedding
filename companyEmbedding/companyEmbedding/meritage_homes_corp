Homebuilder stocks fall after several downgrades at Barclays
Homebuilder stocks slumped broadly Tuesday, after Barclays downgraded several of them, and reiterated a bearish view on some others, citing concerns that valuations suggest investors may be too optimistic in the face of data pointing to moderating buyer traffic trends. Toll Brothers Inc.'s stock  shed 1.6% after analyst Michael Dahl downgraded it to underweight from equal weight, while shares of Lennar Corp.  fell 1.5%, PulteGroup Inc.  lost 0.6% and TRI Pointe Group Inc.  dropped 1.7% after Dahl downgraded them to equal weight from overweight. Shares of KB Home  slipped 0.2%, Meritage Homes Corp.  gave up 0.8% and Realogy Holdings Corp.  lost 0.3% after Dahl reiterated his underweight ratings. "Our June A.G.E.N.T. Survey indicated moderating buyer traffic trends, warning of risk that near-term catalysts for builders will disappoint relative to rising expectations," Dahl wrote in a note to clients. Separately, CalAtlantic Group Inc.'s stock  bucked the sector's trend by rallying 0.8%, after Dahl upgraded it to equal weight from underweight, citing its recent underperformance relative to the group. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF , which was down 0.6% in morning trade, has run up 25% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.4% this year.

Firm Description
                    Some might say it's important to tell you that we've been around since 1985. Or that we've won a slew of awards ranging from Forbes' Platinum 400 Best Big Companies of America to being the recipient of Texas' Builder of the Year five times, or being named ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year. But we're about practicality and doing things that actually make a difference in your life and the way you live.For instance, you're probably a lot more interested in knowing that Meritage builds new, beautifully designed, energy-efficient homes that can save you as much as 50% on your utility bills.* Or, that we were the first national top 10 homebuilder to have every home we build be 100% ENERGY STAR certified. That means it saves you energy and money.With more than 75,000 homes built, our focus, since day one, has been to build incredible new homes and communities in prime locations for fantastic prices. We build them for real people: People with families and those without; people with everyday, busy lives, and those who are now enjoying a more relaxed lifestyle. But more than anything, we build energy-efficient homes and communities for people who appreciate a home being built the way it can, and should, be built. For you it means having a new home that comes standard with ENERGY STAR features that save money and energy, month after month, at no extra cost to you.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 12/21/1995
            

                BBB has determined that Meritage Homes Corporation meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Meritage Homes Corporation has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 26 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

The DifferenceBuilding NewCustomer ReferralsAn Award-Winning BuilderYour Dream HomeStanding Behind Our Homes



                The Difference
                

The Taylor Morrison Difference
It's pretty simple when you think about it. We're here to build a home that your family will love to call home and that you'll be proud to own for years to come. If it doesn't meet those standards, we haven't done our job.
We start with a simple question: What makes a great home? Home buyers like you have told us what they value and expect from a home builder. From that feedback, we've created these objectives that we live by every day:

Homes that use design to create spaces that work for you and your family.
People who are knowledgeable and passionate about what they do.
Financing programs that are clear to understand and save you time and money.
Warranty programs that fix what's wrong and provide you with peace of mind.

These things may seem like simple ideas but they're important. We want you to love the home we build for you. Trust us to build it for you.



                Building New
                
Build New
We've been building homes for more than a century. When you've been doing something that long you learn a few things. You learn the right way to build. You learn that people matter. And you learn that the real staying power is in giving people a home that they want and one you know is built to last. That last one's pretty important, don't you think?
What this means for you is our homes are built to exacting standards and are built by quality people who understand that your home is the most important home they can build. And they're built to give you the lifestyle you want, no matter what life stage you and your family currently occupy.



                Customer Referrals
                
Customer Referrals
We take things like quality construction, superior design and customer service very seriously. It's your home. You've trusted us to build it for you. That means something.
That's why it matters to us what you think of the Taylor Morrison home that you buy. Reviews matter. What you think of our homes matters.
We want to hear from you. We want to know what you think. Only then can we create the best home possible for you and your family.



                An Award-Winning Builder
                
An Award-Winning Builder
Here's the plain truth: Your new home is as important to us as it is to you and your family. There, we said it. We work hard to deliver well-built homes and we stand behind what we build. Our commitment to quality gets right to the point:

Our homes use design to create spaces that work for you and your family.
Our craftsmanship doesn't cut corners and pays attention to even the smallest detail.
Our people are knowledgeable and passionate about what they do.
Our communities are built in locations close to excellent schools, shopping and services
Our neighborhoods have plenty of high-quality amenities and public areas
Our financing programs are clear to understand and save you time and money.
Our warranty programs fix what's wrong and provide you with peace of mind.




                Your Dream Home
                
Your Dream Home
At Taylor Morrison, "inspired by you" is more than just a catchphrase…it's our passion. And it's that passion that we call on to deliver your dream home. We want you and your family to love the home you own. We want you to be happy in a Taylor Morrison home.
We think experience matters. More than 100 years of building experience is built into every Taylor Morrison home. Perhaps that's why we are one of the top home builders in the United States.
Today, Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes communities are currently under construction in the Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas, drawing accolades from home buyers and industry experts alike. 



                Standing Behind Our Homes
                
Standing Behind Our Homes
Every home we build is backed by one of the best limited warranties in the business. Your new home is covered for any repairs outside of normal maintenance as well as for any major structural defects. How can we do this? Simple. We can offer these assurances because we select quality materials, employ select trade partners and insist on construction techniques proven over time.
Our confidence in our warranty is a reflection of the confidence we have in the homes that we build. But you know what's even better? When you feel just as confident. That's what matters.
