      Fitch Rates World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B
    





October 15, 2015 11:37 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B (WOART 
      2015-B):
    

      --$216,000,000 Class A-1 Notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$280,000,000 Class A-2a Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$133,000,000 Class A-2b Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$234,000,000 Class A-3 Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$125,000,000 Class A-4 Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,160,000 Class B Notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Pool Quality: 2015-B has relatively stable credit quality 
      with a weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. N.A (FICO) score of 724, 
      within range of recent 2014 - 2015 pools, although marginally lower. New 
      vehicles total 97%, and the pool is geographically concentrated in the 
      Southeast, consistent with historical World Omni originations.
    

      High Percentage of Extended-Term Loans: Loans with original terms 
      greater than 60 months total 76.50% in 2015-B. Extended-term loans have 
      historically produced higher loss rates. Mitigating this somewhat is 
      that the borrowers within this longer term range have strong obligor 
      FICO scores. Fitch accounted for this risk in its determination of the 
      loss proxy.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: Credit enhancement (CE) in 2015-B 
      is consistent with prior transactions. The structure is able to support 
      multiples of Fitch's base case loss proxy of 2.10% that are commensurate 
      with the expected ratings.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: World Omni's portfolio and 
      securitization delinquency and loss performance has improved since 2009 
      and has been relatively stable in 2013-2015, despite coming off record 
      lows.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes World Omni 
      to be a capable originator, underwriter, and servicer for 2015-B as 
      evidenced by the historical performance of its managed portfolio and 
      securitizations.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of World Omni would not impair the timeliness 
      of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to World Omni 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B to increased credit losses over the life 
      of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. The 
      sensitivity analysis shows a potential downgrade of one category for 
      both classes of notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of two or more rating 
      categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP (EY). The third-party due diligence focused on an extract of 
      125 retail instalment sale contracts that were selected by EY and 
      verified for details such as customer name and state, interest rate, 
      monthly payment amount, original term, FICO etc. In that sample set all 
      compared information was in agreement. Fitch considered this information 
      in its analysis and concluded that the findings do not impact our 
      analysis.
    

      A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary. As such, no adjustments 
      were made to Fitch's analysis.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 
      2015-B--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's June 2015 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B (WOART 
      2015-B):
    

      --$216,000,000 Class A-1 Notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$280,000,000 Class A-2a Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$125,000,000 Class A-4 Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,160,000 Class B Notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Pool Quality: 2015-B has relatively stable credit quality 
      with a weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. N.A (FICO) score of 724, 
      within range of recent 2014 - 2015 pools, although marginally lower. New 
      vehicles total 97%, and the pool is geographically concentrated in the 
      Southeast, consistent with historical World Omni originations.
    

      High Percentage of Extended-Term Loans: Loans with original terms 
      greater than 60 months total 76.50% in 2015-B. Extended-term loans have 
      historically produced higher loss rates. Mitigating this somewhat is 
      that the borrowers within this longer term range have strong obligor 
      FICO scores. Fitch accounted for this risk in its determination of the 
      loss proxy.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: Credit enhancement (CE) in 2015-B 
      is consistent with prior transactions. The structure is able to support 
      multiples of Fitch's base case loss proxy of 2.10% that are commensurate 
      with the expected ratings.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: World Omni's portfolio and 
      securitization delinquency and loss performance has improved since 2009 
      and has been relatively stable in 2013-2015, despite coming off record 
      lows.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes World Omni 
      to be a capable originator, underwriter, and servicer for 2015-B as 
      evidenced by the historical performance of its managed portfolio and 
      securitizations.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of World Omni would not impair the timeliness 
      of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to World Omni 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B to increased credit losses over the life 
      of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. The 
      sensitivity analysis shows a potential downgrade of one category for 
      both classes of notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of two or more rating 
      categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP (EY). The third-party due diligence focused on an extract of 
      125 retail instalment sale contracts that were selected by EY and 
      verified for details such as customer name and state, interest rate, 
      monthly payment amount, original term, FICO etc. In that sample set all 
      compared information was in agreement. Fitch considered this information 
      in its analysis and concluded that the findings do not impact our 
      analysis.
    

      A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary. As such, no adjustments 
      were made to Fitch's analysis.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 
      2015-B--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's June 2015 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform in line with Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the original ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited stable performance with losses in line with Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B:--Class A-2a at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-2b at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Related ResearchWorld Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/871929Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1011642Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1011642Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Section
2.04         
Transfer Restrictions on Notes

 

(a)          As
of the date of this Indenture, the Retained Notes have not been
registered under the Securities Act and will not be listed on any
exchange.  Unless and until such Notes have been sold
pursuant to a transaction registered under the Securities Act, no
transfer of such a Note shall be made unless such transfer is made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or is
exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act
and such state securities laws.  Except in a transfer
pursuant to Rule 144A or a transfer to the Depositor or by the
Depositor to an Affiliate thereof, in the event that a transfer is
to be made in reliance upon an exemption from the Securities Act
and state securities laws, in order to assure compliance with the
Securities Act and such laws, the Noteholder desiring to effect
such transfer and such Noteholder’s prospective transferee
shall each certify to the Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee and
WOAR in writing the facts surrounding the transfer in substantially
the forms set forth in Exhibit E (the “ Transferor
Certificate ”) and Exhibit F (the “
Investment Letter ”).  Except in a transfer
pursuant to Rule 144A or a transfer to the Depositor or by the
Depositor to an Affiliate thereof, there shall also be delivered to
the Issuing Entity and the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption from the
Securities Act, which opinion of counsel shall not be an expense of
the Trust, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee (unless it is
the transferee from whom such opinion is to be obtained) or of WOAR
or World Omni.  WOAR shall provide to any Noteholder and
any prospective transferee designated by any such Noteholder
information regarding the Retained Notes and the Receivables and
such other information as shall be necessary to satisfy the
condition to eligibility set forth in Rule 144A(d)(4) for transfer
of any such Retained Notes without registration thereof under the
Securities Act pursuant to the registration exemption provided by
Rule 144A.  Each Noteholder desiring to effect such a
transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Issuing
Entity, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, WOAR and World
Omni (in any capacity) against any liability that may result if the
transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with federal
and state securities laws.

 

(b)          (i)
Sale, pledge or transfer of a Retained Note may only be made to a
Person who is a United States Person (within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) and is not acquiring such
Retained Notes with the assets of any Plan that is subject to Title
I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; and (ii) no sale, pledge,
or transfer of a Retained Note shall be made (x) to any one person
in an amount less than $2,000,000 (or such other amount as the
Depositor may determine in order to prevent the Issuing Entity from
being treated as a “publicly traded partnership” under
Section 7704 of the Code) or (y) to a Special Pass-Through Entity,
in each case under this clause (ii), unless (A) an opinion of
counsel satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor
that such sale, pledge, or transfer shall not cause the Issuing
Entity to be treated as an association (or publicly traded
partnership) taxable as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes shall have been delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the
Depositor and (B) the Depositor shall have provided prior written
approval; provided , however , that the restrictions
in Section 2.04(b)(i) and (ii) above shall not
continue to apply to such Retained Notes (covered by the opinion
described in this clause) in the event counsel satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor has rendered an opinion, with
respect to the sale, pledge or transfer by the Depositor or an
Affiliate thereof, to the effect that the Retained Notes to be
sold, pledged, or transferred will be characterized as indebtedness
for federal income tax purposes.  Any transferee, other
than the Depositor or an Affiliate thereof, acquiring a Retained
Note or an interest therein shall be deemed to have made the
representations set forth in Section 2.14 (as if Section
2.14(a) applied to the Retained Notes).   Any attempted
sale, pledge or other transfer in contravention of this Section
2.4(b) will be void ab initio and the purported transferor will
continue to be treated as the owner of the Retained
Note.

 





5





 


 

For the purposes of this
Section 2.4(b) , “Special Pass-Through Entity”
means a grantor trust, S corporation, or partnership (as
determined, in each case, for Federal income tax purposes) where
more than 50% of the value of any beneficial owner’s interest
in such pass through entity is attributable to the pass-through
entity’s interest in the Retained Note.

 

(c)          [Reserved].

 

(d)          By
acquiring a Note other than any Retained Note to which the
restrictions of Section 2.04(b) of this Indenture apply, each
initial purchaser, transferee and owner of a beneficial interest in
such Note will be deemed to represent that either (1) it is not
acquiring the Notes with the assets of any Plan or (2) the
acquisition and holding of such Notes will not give rise to a
nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Law. Each Note other than any
Retained Note will bear a legend reflecting such deemed
representation.  By acquiring a Retained Note to which
the restrictions of Section 2.04(b) of this Indenture apply,
each initial purchaser, transferee and owner of a beneficial
interest in such Retained Note will be deemed to represent that
either (1) it is not acquiring such Retained Note with the assets
of any Plan that is subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or (2) it is acquiring such Retained Note with the assets
of a Plan that is not subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code and the acquisition and holding of such Retained Note
will not give rise to a nonexempt prohibited transaction under
Similar Law.

 

(e)          By
directly or indirectly acquiring a Retained Note in a transaction
pursuant to Rule 144A, each initial purchaser, transferee and owner
of a beneficial interest will be deemed to represent, warrant and
agree as follows:

 

(i)          it
understands that such Notes have not been registered under the
Securities Act, and may not be sold except as permitted in the
following sentence.  It understands and agrees, on its
own behalf and on behalf of any accounts for which it is acting as
hereinafter stated, (x) that such Notes are being offered only in a
transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of
the Securities Act and (y) that such Notes may be resold, pledged
or transferred only (i) to the Depositor, (ii) to an
“accredited investor” as defined in Rule
501(a)(1),(2),(3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act
(an “ Accredited Investor ”) acting for its own
account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or
agent for others (which others also are Accredited Investors unless
the holder is a bank acting in its fiduciary capacity) that
executes a certificate substantially in the form of the Investment
Letter, (iii) so long as such Note is eligible for resale pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person whom it
reasonably believes after due inquiry is a “qualified
institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A, acting for its
own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary
or agent for others (which others also are “qualified
institutional buyers”) to whom notice is given that the
resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A
or (iv) in a sale, pledge or other transfer made in a transaction
otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, in which case the Indenture Trustee shall require
that both the prospective transferor and the prospective transferee
certify to the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor in writing the
facts surrounding such transfer, which certification shall be in
form and substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the
Depositor.  Except in the case of a transfer described in
clauses (i) or (iii) above, the Indenture Trustee
shall require that a written opinion of counsel (which will not be
at the expense of the Depositor, any Affiliate of the Depositor or
the Indenture Trustee), satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and
the Depositor, be delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the
Depositor to the effect that such transfer will not violate the
Securities Act, and will be effected in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of each state of the United
States.  It will notify any purchaser of such Notes from
it of the above resale restrictions, if then
applicable.  It further understands that in connection
with any transfer of such Notes by it that the Indenture Trustee
and the Depositor may request, and if so requested it will furnish,
such certificates and other information as they may reasonably
require to confirm that any such transfer complies with the
foregoing restrictions;

(ii)         it
is a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined under
Rule 144A under the Securities Act and is acquiring such Notes for
its own account (and not for the account of others) or as a
fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are
“qualified institutional buyers”).  It is
familiar with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and is aware that
the seller of such Notes  and other parties intend to
rely on the foregoing representations, warranties and
acknowledgements and the exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule
144A;

 

(iii)        [Reserved];

 

(iv)        it
understands that Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee, the
Depositor and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements, and it
agrees that if any of the acknowledgments, representations and
warranties deemed to have been made by it by its purchase of such
Notes, for its own account or for one or more accounts as to each
of which it exercises sole investment discretion, are no longer
accurate, it shall promptly notify the Depositor; and

 

(v)         Issuing
Entity, the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor are entitled to
rely upon the foregoing representations, warranties and
acknowledgements and are irrevocably authorized to produce the
foregoing representations, warranties and acknowledgments or a copy
hereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal
proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the matters covered
hereby.

Section
2.05         
Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange . The
Issuing Entity shall cause a note registrar (the “ Note
Registrar ”) to keep a register (the “ Note
Register ”) in which the Note Registrar shall provide for
the registration of Notes and the registration of transfers of
Notes.  The Indenture Trustee initially shall be the Note
Registrar for the purpose of registering Notes and transfers of
Notes as herein provided.  Upon any resignation of any
Note Registrar, the Issuing Entity shall promptly appoint a
successor or, if it elects not to make such an appointment, assume
the duties of Note Registrar.

 

If a Person other than
the Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuing Entity as Note
Registrar, the Issuing Entity will give the Indenture Trustee
prompt written notice of the appointment of such Note Registrar and
of the location, and any change in the location, of the Note
Register, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to inspect
the Note Register at all reasonable times and to obtain copies
thereof, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to rely
upon a certificate executed on behalf of the Note Registrar by an
Executive Officer thereof as to the names and addresses of the
Holders of the Notes and the principal amounts and number of such
Notes.

 

Upon surrender for
registration of transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the
Issuing Entity to be maintained as provided in
Section 3.02 , if the requirements of Section 8-401 of
the UCC are met the Issuing Entity shall execute, and the Indenture
Trustee shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Notes of the same Class in any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal
amount.

 

At the option of the
Holder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of the same Class in
any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount,
upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or
agency.  Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for
exchange, if the requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met
the Issuing Entity shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture
Trustee, the Notes which the Noteholder making the exchange is
entitled to receive.

 

All Notes issued upon
any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the
valid obligations of the Issuing Entity, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the
Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the
benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and
all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

Agency or (iii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default or

beneficial interests aggregating at least a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities advise the
Clearing Agency in writing that the continuation of a book-entry
system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best
interests of such Note Owners, then the Clearing Agency shall
notify all Note Owners and the Indenture Trustee of the occurrence
of any such event and of the availability of Definitive Notes to
Note Owners requesting the same.  Upon surrender to the

Entity, by entering into this Indenture, and each Noteholder, by
its acceptance of a Note (and each Note Owner by its acceptance of
an interest in the applicable Book-Entry Note), agree to treat the
Notes (other than Notes held by any entity whose separate existence
from the Issuing Entity is disregarded for federal income tax
purposes, but only so long as such Notes are held by such entity)
for all purposes including federal, state and local income, single
business and franchise tax purposes as indebtedness.

Noteholder or Note Owner, by its acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note, agrees to
provide to the Person from whom it receives payments on the Notes
(including the Paying Agent) the Noteholder Tax Identification
Information and, upon request, to the extent FATCA Withholding Tax
is applicable, the Noteholder FATCA Information.

notices of redemption as a convenience to Noteholders;
provided that any such notice may state that no
representation is made as to the correctness of such
“CUSIP” numbers either as printed on the Notes or as
contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be
placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the
Notes  and any such redemption shall not be affected by
any defect in or omission of such numbers.  The Depositor

Section
3.07         
Performance of Obligations; Servicing of Receivables
.

 

(a)          The
Issuing Entity will not take any action and will use its best
efforts not to permit any action to be taken by others that would
release any Person from any of such Person’s material
covenants or obligations under any instrument or agreement included
in the Trust Estate or that would result in the amendment,
hypothecation, subordination, termination or discharge of, or
impair the validity or effectiveness of, any such instrument or
agreement, except as expressly provided in this Indenture, the Sale
and Servicing Agreement or such other instrument or
agreement.

(b)          The
Issuing Entity may contract with other Persons to assist it in
performing its duties under this Indenture, and any performance of
such duties by a Person identified to the Indenture Trustee in an
Officer’s Certificate of the Issuing Entity shall be deemed
to be action taken by the Issuing Entity.  Initially, the
Issuing Entity has contracted with the Servicer and the
Administrator to assist the Issuing Entity in performing its duties
under this Indenture.

 

(c)          The
Issuing Entity will punctually perform and observe all of its
obligations and agreements contained in this Indenture, the Basic
Documents and in the instruments and agreements included in the
Trust Estate, including but not limited to filing or causing to be
filed all UCC financing statements and continuation statements
required to be filed by the terms of this Indenture and the Sale
and Servicing Agreement in accordance with and within the time
periods provided for herein and therein.  Except as
otherwise expressly provided therein, the Issuing Entity shall not
waive, amend, modify, supplement or terminate any Basic Document or
any provision thereof without the consent of the Indenture Trustee
or the Holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Amount of
the Controlling Securities.

 

(d)          If
the Issuing Entity shall have knowledge of the occurrence of a
Servicer Default under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Issuing Entity shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee and the
Rating Agencies thereof, and shall specify in such notice the
action, if any, the Issuing Entity is taking with respect to such
default.  If a Servicer Default shall arise from the
failure of the Servicer to perform any of its duties or obligations
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement with respect to the
Receivables, the Issuing Entity shall take all reasonable steps
available to it to remedy such failure.

 

(e)          As
promptly as possible after the giving of notice of termination to
the Servicer of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant to
Section 8.01 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Indenture Trustee shall appoint a successor servicer (the “
Successor Servicer ”), and such Successor Servicer
shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a form
acceptable to the Indenture Trustee.  In the event that a
Successor Servicer has not been appointed and accepted its
appointment at the time when the Servicer ceases to act as
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee without further action shall
automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer.  The
Indenture Trustee may resign as the Servicer by giving written
notice of such resignation to the Issuing Entity and the Depositor
and in such event will be released from such duties and
obligations, such release not to be effective until the date a new
servicer enters into a servicing agreement with the Issuing Entity
as provided below.  Upon delivery of any such notice to
the Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee shall obtain a new
servicer as the Successor Servicer under the Sale and Servicing
Agreement.  Any Successor Servicer other than the
Indenture Trustee shall (i) be an established financial
institution having a net worth of not less than $100,000,000 and
whose regular business includes the servicing of Contracts and
(ii) enter into a servicing agreement with the Issuing Entity
having substantially the same provisions as the provisions of the
Sale and Servicing Agreement applicable to the
Servicer.  If within 30 days after the delivery of the
notice referred to above, the Issuing Entity shall not have
obtained such a new servicer, the Indenture Trustee may appoint, or
may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a
Successor Servicer.  In connection with any such
appointment, the Indenture Trustee may make such arrangements for
the compensation of such successor as it and such successor shall
agree, subject to the limitations set forth below and in the Sale
and Servicing Agreement, and in accordance with
Section 8.02 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Issuing Entity shall enter into an agreement with such successor
for the servicing of the Receivables (such agreement to be in form
and substance satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee).  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Sale
and Servicing Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the
Indenture Trustee be liable for any Servicing Fee or for any
differential in the amount of the Servicing Fee paid hereunder and
the amount necessary to induce any Successor Servicer to act as
Successor Servicer under the Basic Documents and the transactions
set forth or provided for therein.  If the Indenture
Trustee shall succeed to the Servicer’s duties as servicer of
the Receivables as provided herein, it shall do so in its
individual capacity and not in its capacity as Indenture Trustee
and, accordingly, the provisions of Article VI hereof
shall be inapplicable to the Indenture Trustee in its duties as the
successor to the Servicer and the servicing of the
Receivables.  In case the Indenture Trustee shall become
successor to the Servicer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to appoint as Servicer any
one of its Affiliates, provided that it shall be fully liable for
the actions and omissions of such Affiliate in such capacity as
Successor Servicer.

 





18





 


 

(f)          Upon
any termination of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant
to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuing Entity shall
promptly notify the Indenture Trustee.  As soon as a
Successor Servicer is appointed, the Indenture Trustee shall notify
the Issuing Entity of such appointment, specifying in such notice
the name and address of such Successor Servicer.

 

(g)          Without
derogating from the absolute nature of the assignment granted to
the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture or the rights of the
Indenture Trustee hereunder, the Issuing Entity agrees
(i) that it will not, without the prior written consent of the
Indenture Trustee or the Holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities and, if such
action would result in a material adverse effect on, the Swap
Counterparty, if any, amend, modify, waive, supplement, terminate
or surrender, or agree to any amendment, modification, supplement,
termination, waiver or surrender of, the terms of any Collateral
(except to the extent otherwise provided in the Sale and Servicing
Agreement) or the Trust Agreement, the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the Administration
Agreement, the Interest Rate Swaps, if any, or the Swap
Counterparty Rights Agreement, if any (except as may be permitted
thereby), or waive timely performance or observance by the Servicer
or the Depositor under the Sale and Servicing Agreement (except as
may be permitted thereby); and (ii) that any such amendment
shall not (A) increase or reduce in any manner the amount of,
or accelerate or delay the timing of, distributions that are
required to be made for the benefit of the Noteholders or
(B) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the Controlling
Securities that is required to consent to any such amendment,
without the consent of the Holders of all the Outstanding
Notes.  If any such amendment, modification, supplement
or waiver shall be so consented to by the Indenture Trustee or such
Holders, the Issuing Entity agrees, promptly following a request by
the Indenture Trustee to do so, to execute and deliver, in its own
name and at its own expense, such agreements, instruments, consents
and other documents as the Indenture Trustee may deem necessary or
appropriate in the circumstances.

therein or the proceeds thereof (other than tax liens,
mechanics’ liens and other liens that arise by operation of
law, in each case on any of the Financed Vehicles and arising
solely as a result of an action or omission of the related Obligor)
or (C) permit the lien of this Indenture not to constitute a
valid first priority (other than with respect to any such tax,
mechanics’ or other lien) security interest in the Trust
Estate.

(b)          The
Issuing Entity shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee, within five
days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an
Officer’s Certificate of any event which with the giving of
notice and the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under
clause (a)(iii) , its status and what action the
Issuing Entity is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto.

 

(c)          Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a delay in or failure of performance referred to
under clauses (a)(i) and (ii) above for a period of
ten Business Days or referred to under clause (a)(iii) for a
period of 90 Business Days, shall not constitute an Event of
Default if such delay or failure could not be prevented by the
exercise of reasonable diligence by the Issuing Entity or the
Indenture Trustee, as applicable, and was caused by an act of God
or other similar occurrence.  Upon the occurrence of any
such event, each of the Issuing Entity and the Indenture Trustee,
as applicable, shall not be relieved from using its best efforts to
perform its obligations in a timely manner in accordance with the
terms of this Indenture and the Issuing Entity or the Indenture
Trustee, as applicable, shall provide the Indenture Trustee (if
such delay or failure is a result of a delay or failure by the
Issuing Entity), the Owner Trustee, the Noteholders and the
Certificateholders prompt notice of such failure or delay by it,
together with a description of its efforts to so perform its
obligations.

 

Section
5.02         
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment . If an
Event of Default should occur and be continuing, then and in every
such case the Indenture Trustee or the Holders of Notes
representing at least a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the
Controlling Securities may declare all the Notes to be immediately
due and payable, by a notice in writing to the Issuing Entity (and
to the Indenture Trustee if given by Noteholders) and the Indenture
Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Swap
Counterparty, if any, and upon any such declaration the unpaid
principal amount of such Notes, together with accrued and unpaid
interest thereon through the date of acceleration, shall become
immediately due and payable.

 

At any time after such
declaration of acceleration of maturity has been made and before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained
by the Indenture Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article V provided, the Holders of Notes representing
at least a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling
Securities, by written notice to the Issuing Entity and the
Indenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its
consequences if:

 

(i)          the
Issuing Entity has paid or deposited with the Indenture Trustee a
sum sufficient to pay:

 

      (A)         all
payments of principal of and interest on all Notes and all other
amounts that would then be due hereunder or upon such Notes if the
Event of Default giving rise to such acceleration had not occurred;
and

 





27





 


 

      (B)         all
sums paid or advanced by the Indenture Trustee hereunder and the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Indenture Trustee and its agents and counsel; and

 

(ii)         all
Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of
the Notes that has become due solely by such acceleration, have
been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.12
.

 

No such rescission shall
affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent
thereto.

 

Section
5.03

Indenture Trustee .

 

(a)          The
Issuing Entity covenants that if (i) an Event of Default
specified in Section 5.01(i) has occurred and is
continuing or (ii) an Event of Default specified in
Section 5.01(ii) has occurred and is continuing, the
Issuing Entity will, upon demand of the Indenture Trustee, pay to
it, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, the whole amount
then due and payable on such Notes for principal and interest, with
interest on the overdue principal and, to the extent payment at
such rate of interest shall be legally enforceable, on overdue
installments of interest at the rate borne by the Notes and, in
addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Indenture Trustee and its agents and counsel.

 

(b)          In
case the Issuing Entity shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts
upon such demand, the Indenture Trustee, in its own name and as
trustee of an express trust, may institute a Proceeding for the
collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such
Proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same
against the Issuing Entity or other obligor upon such Notes and
collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the
Issuing Entity or other obligor upon such Notes, wherever situated,
the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable.

 

(c)          If
an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee
may, as more particularly provided in Section 5.04 ,
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Noteholders, by such appropriate Proceedings as the Indenture
Trustee may deem necessary to protect and enforce any such rights,
whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement
in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted
herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or equitable
right vested in the Indenture Trustee by this Indenture or by
law.

case there shall be pending, relative to the Issuing Entity or any
other obligor upon the Notes or any Person having or claiming an
ownership interest in the Trust Estate, Proceedings under
Title 11 of the United States Code or any other applicable
federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or in
case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or
reorganization, or liquidator, sequestrator or similar official
shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Issuing
Entity or its property or such other obligor or Person, or in case
of any other comparable judicial Proceedings relative to the
Issuing Entity or other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors
or property of the Issuing Entity or such other obligor, the
Indenture Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of any
Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Indenture
Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of
this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in
such Proceedings or otherwise:

and any trustee,
receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official in any
such Proceeding is hereby authorized by each of such Noteholders to
make payments to the Indenture Trustee and, in the event that the
Indenture Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly
to such Noteholders, to pay to the Indenture Trustee such amounts
as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the
Indenture Trustee, each predecessor Indenture Trustee and their
respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses
and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Indenture
Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee except as a result

29





 


 

(f)          All
rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or
under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Indenture Trustee
without the possession of any of the Notes or the production
thereof in any trial or other Proceedings relative thereto, and any
such action or Proceedings instituted by the Indenture Trustee
shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust,
and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of the
expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Indenture Trustee,
each predecessor Indenture Trustee and their respective agents and
attorneys, shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the
Notes.

 

(g)          In
any Proceedings brought by the Indenture Trustee (and also any
Proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this
Indenture to which the Indenture Trustee shall be a party), the
Indenture Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the
Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any Noteholder a party
to any such Proceedings.

 

Section
5.04         
Remedies; Priorities .

 

(a)          If
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Indenture Trustee may, or at the direction of the holders of at
least a majority of the Controlling Securities shall, do one or
more of the following (subject to Section 5.05
):

 

(i)          institute
Proceedings in its own name and as trustee of an express trust for
the collection of all amounts then payable on the Notes or under
this Indenture with respect thereto, whether by declaration or
otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained and collect from the
Issuing Entity and any other obligor upon such Notes monies
adjudged due;

 

(ii)         institute
Proceedings from time to time for the complete or partial
foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to the Trust
Estate;

 

(iii)        exercise
any remedies of a secured party under the UCC and take any other
appropriate action to protect and enforce the rights and remedies
of the Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Notes;
and

 

(iv)        sell
the Trust Estate or any portion thereof or rights or interest
therein, at one or more public or private sales called and
conducted in any manner permitted by law; provided ,
however , that the Indenture Trustee may not sell or
otherwise liquidate the Trust Estate following an Event of Default,
other than an Event of Default described in
Section 5.01(i) or (ii) , unless (A) the
Holders of 100% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes consent
thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation
distributable to the Noteholders are sufficient to discharge in
full all amounts then due and unpaid upon such Notes for principal
and interest or (C) the Indenture Trustee determines that the
Trust Estate will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the
payment of principal of and interest on the Notes as they would
have become due if the Notes had not been declared due and payable,
and the Indenture Trustee obtains the consent of Holders of not
less than 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling
Securities.  In determining such sufficiency or
insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and
(C) , the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and
rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking or
accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of
such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate
for such purpose.

 





30





 


 

(b)          If
the Indenture Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to
this Article V , it shall pay out the money or property
in the following order or priority:  (i) pro rata to the
Indenture Trustee for amounts due under Section 6.07 and to
the Owner Trustee for amounts due under Section 8.01 and
Section 8.02 of the Trust Agreement and (ii) to the
Collection Account as Collections to be applied pursuant to
Article V of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

 

The Indenture Trustee
may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to
Noteholders pursuant to this Section.  At least 15 days
before such record date, the Issuing Entity shall mail to each
Noteholder and the Indenture Trustee a notice that states the
record date, the payment date and the amount to be paid.

 

Section
5.05         
Optional Preservation of the Receivables . If the Notes have
been declared to be due and payable under Section 5.02
following an Event of Default and such declaration and its
consequences have not been rescinded and annulled, the Indenture
Trustee may, but need not, elect to maintain possession of the
Trust Estate.  It is the desire of the parties hereto and
the Noteholders that there be at all times sufficient funds for the
payment of principal of and interest on the Notes, and the
Indenture Trustee shall take such desire into account when
determining whether or not to maintain possession of the Trust
Estate.  In determining whether to maintain possession of
the Trust Estate, the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain
and rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking or
accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of
such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate
for such purpose.

 

Section
5.06         
Limitation of Suits . No Holder of any Note shall have any
right to institute any Proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with
respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or

Holder has previously given written notice to the Indenture Trustee
of a continuing Event of Default;

 

(ii)         the
Holders of not less than 25% of the Outstanding Amount of the
Controlling Securities have made written request to the Indenture
Trustee to institute such Proceeding in respect of such Event of
Default in its own name as Indenture Trustee hereunder;

 

(iii)        such
Holder or Holders have offered to the Indenture Trustee indemnity
reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and
liabilities to be incurred in complying with such

31





 


 

(v)         no
direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to
the Indenture Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of
at least a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling
Securities.

 

It is understood and
intended that no one or more Holders of Notes shall have any right
in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any
provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the
rights of any other Holders of Notes or to obtain or to seek to
obtain priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce
any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein
provided.

 

Subject to Section
5.06(v) , in the event the Indenture Trustee shall receive, in
connection with Sections 5.06(ii) and (iii) ,
conflicting or inconsistent requests and indemnity from two or more
groups of Holders of Notes, each representing less than a majority
of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities, the
Indenture Trustee shall act at the direction of the group of
Holders of Notes representing the greater Outstanding Amount of
Controlling Securities.  If the Indenture Trustee
receives, in connection with this Section 5.06 , conflicting
or inconsistent requests and indemnity from two or more groups of
Holders of Notes representing an equal Outstanding Amount of the
Controlling Securities, the Indenture Trustee in its sole
discretion may determine what action, if any, shall be taken,
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture.

 

Section
5.07         
Unconditional Rights of Noteholders to Receive Principal and
Interest . Notwithstanding any other provisions in this
Indenture, the Holder of any Note shall have the right, which is
absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of
and interest, if any, on such Note on or after the respective due
dates thereof expressed in such Note or in this Indenture (or, in
the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) and to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such
right shall not be impaired without the consent of such
Holder.

 

Section
5.08         
Restoration of Rights and Remedies . If the Indenture
Trustee or any Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce
any right or remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has
been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been
determined adversely to the Indenture Trustee or to such
Noteholder, then and in every such case the Issuing Entity, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall, subject to any
determination in such Proceeding, be restored severally and
respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter
all rights and remedies of the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall continue as though no such Proceeding had been
instituted.

 

Section
5.09         
Rights and Remedies Cumulative . No right or remedy herein
conferred upon or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or to the
Noteholders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or
remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted
by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any
right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the
concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right
or remedy.

 





32





 


 

Section
5.10          Delay
or Omission Not a Waiver . No delay or omission of the
Indenture Trustee or any Holder of any Note to exercise any right
or remedy accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall
impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such
Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein.  Every right and remedy given by this
Article V or by law to the Indenture Trustee or to the
Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may
be deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or by the
Noteholders, as the case may be.

 

Section
5.11         
Control by Noteholders . The Holders of at least a majority
of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities shall have
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
Proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee with
respect to the Notes or exercising any trust or power conferred on
the Indenture Trustee; provided that:

 

(i)          such
direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with
this Indenture;

 

(ii)         subject
to the express terms of Section 5.04 , any direction to
the Indenture Trustee to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate shall
be by Holders of Notes representing not less than 100% of the
Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities;

 

(iii)        if
the conditions set forth in Section 5.05 have been
satisfied and the Indenture Trustee elects to retain the Trust
Estate pursuant to such Section, then any direction to the
Indenture Trustee by Holders of Notes representing less than 100%
of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities to sell or
liquidate the Trust Estate shall be of no force and effect;
and

 

(iv)        the
Indenture Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Indenture Trustee that is not inconsistent with such
direction.

 

Notwithstanding the
rights of Noteholders set forth in this Section, subject to
Section 6.01 , the Indenture Trustee need not take any
action that it determines might involve it in liability or might
materially adversely affect the rights of any Noteholders not
consenting to such action.

 

Section
5.12         
Waiver of Past Defaults . Prior to the declaration of the
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes as provided in
Section 5.02 , the Holders of Notes of at least a
majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities
may waive any past Default or Event of Default and its consequences
except a Default (a) in payment of principal of or interest on
any of the Notes or (b) in respect of a covenant or provision
hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of
the Holder of each Note.  The Indenture Trustee will give
written notice of any such waiver to the Swap Counterparty, if
any.  In the case of any such waiver, the Issuing Entity,
the Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder,
respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

 

Upon any such waiver,
such Default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured
and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have
occurred, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver
shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default
or impair any right consequent thereto.

Section
5.13         
Undertaking for Costs . All parties to this Indenture agree,
and each Holder of a Note by such Holder’s acceptance thereof
shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or
remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Indenture
Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as
Indenture Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of
an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court
may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and reasonable expenses, against any party
litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good
faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but
the provisions of this Section shall not apply to (a) any
suit instituted by the Indenture Trustee, (b) any suit
instituted by any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, in each case
holding in the aggregate more than 10% of the Outstanding Amount of
the Controlling Securities or (c) any suit instituted by any
Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of principal of or
interest on any Note on or after the respective due dates expressed
in such Note and in this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption,
on or after the Redemption Date).

 

Section
5.14         
Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws . The Issuing Entity
covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will
not at any time insist upon, or plead or in any manner whatsoever
claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension
law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that
may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and
the Issuing Entity (to the extent that it may lawfully do so)
hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law,
and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the
execution of any power herein granted to the Indenture Trustee, but
will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though
no such law had been enacted.

 

Section
5.15         
Action on Notes . The Indenture Trustee’s right to
seek and recover judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture
shall not be affected by the seeking, obtaining or application of
any other relief under or with respect to this
Indenture.  Neither the lien of this Indenture nor any
rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders
shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment by the Indenture
Trustee against the Issuing Entity or by the levy of any execution
under such judgment upon any portion of the Trust Estate or upon
any of the assets of the Issuing Entity.  Any money or
property collected by the Indenture Trustee shall be applied in
accordance with Section 5.04(b) .

Section
6.01         
Duties of Indenture Trustee .

 

(a)          If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture
Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this
Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their
exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own
affairs.

 

(b)          Except
during the continuance of an Event of Default:

 

(i)          the
Indenture Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such
duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture
against the Indenture Trustee; and

 





35





 


 

(ii)         in
the absence of bad faith on its part, the Indenture Trustee may
conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the
correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or
opinions furnished to the Indenture Trustee and conforming to the
requirements of this Indenture; however, in the case of
certificates or opinions specifically required by any provision of
this Indenture to be furnished to it, the Indenture Trustee shall
examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not
they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not
confirm or investigate the accuracy of any mathematical
calculations or other facts stated therein).

 

(c)          The
