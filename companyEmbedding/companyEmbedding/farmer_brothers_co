Farmer Bros. Co. is an American coffee foodservice company based in Northlake, Texas. The company specializes in the manufacture and distribution of coffee, tea, and approximately 300 other foodservice items used by restaurants and other establishments.[4] Mike Keown serves as the CEO of the company.
Company history[edit]
In 1912, Roy E. Farmer started a small business roasting coffee beans and selling them door to door in Los Angeles, California. Following a decade of success, Farmer incorporated in 1923 while simultaneously expanding the scope of the company to include the sale of coffee equipment, marked by the acquisition of Western Urn Manufacturing. As the company grew, they began opening branch locations throughout California, quickly establishing a notable presence in developing San Francisco.[5] Starting in the 1930s, Farmer Brothers diversified to include the sale and distribution of not just coffee beans and equipment, but a wider selection of supporting foodservice items.
When Roy E. Farmer died in 1951 at age 59, his son, Roy F. Farmer assumed control of the company. The transition proved hard on the company as the younger Farmer was forced take the company public in 1952. As Roy F. settled, he was able to greatly improve production efficiency and increase profit margins. In the following years of Roy F. Farmer's tenure as chairman, CEO, and president, the company reached a peak of $240 million in sales in 1998. At this point the company had nearly 100 branches in 29 states in the Western US. At this same time, however, the company became mired in shareholder unrest; shareholders demanded greater transparency into the company's operations and market strategy, wanted executives to work with Wall Street analysts, and wanted independent directors added to the board. Despite this, the company remained fairly private and closed to the public. At the time of Roy F. Farmer's death following a more than 50-year stint heading the company (he was 87) a successor had not been named.[6]
In the years following Farmer's death, Guenter Berger served as chief executive and Roy E. Farmer left the company for a time. Some time later, Roger M. Laverty III was appointed as CEO and President and during his time as Chief Executive, Farmer Brothers acquired Coffee Bean International and the Direct Store Delivery coffee business of Sara Lee. The later acquisition was for a reported $45 million.[7] He served until April 2011. At that point, Jeffrey Wahba (Treasurer and CFO) and Patrick Criteser (President and CEO of Coffee Bean International) were appointed by the board as co-CEOs on an interim basis.[8]
In March 2012, the company appointed a new CEO and President, Michael Keown. Keown came to the company from WhiteWave Foods, a subsidiary of Dean Foods Company.[9] Then on April 15, 2013, Farmer Bros. appointed Mark Nelson as its new CFO.[10]
On April 28, 2015, Farmer Brothers announced that they will be moving their headquarters from Torrance to Northlake, Texas to save about $12-$15 annually.[11] President and CEO Mike Keown said "We will relocate our company headquarters to a state-of-the-art facility in a location central to our nation-wide customer base, and provide incremental manufacturing capacity to support future growth." The new Northlake headquarters is scheduled to open in 2016 and will bring 300 new jobs, becoming Northlake's largest employer.
Public Domain Coffee[edit]
The acquisition of Coffee Bean International by Farmer Brothers was part of the company's expansion into "specialty coffee". As an outgrowth of that initiative, Public Domain was established in April 2010.[12] A subsidiary of Farmer Brothers, Public Domain is the company's flagship coffeehouse which also serves as a lab and training facility for their baristas. The establishment is nationally-recognized and is located in downtown Portland, Oregon (as is the headquarters of Coffee Bean International).[13] In what some reviewers have dubbed a "cautiously designed corporate coffeehouse for high-quality coffee", Farmer Brothers showcases its "top shelf" coffees.[14]

The company specializes in the manufacture and distribution of coffee, tea, and approximately 300 other foodservice items used by restaurants and other establishments.[4] Mike Keown serves as the CEO of the company.

In 1912, Roy E. Farmer started a small business roasting coffee beans and selling them door to door in Los Angeles, California. Following a decade of success, Farmer incorporated in 1923 while simultaneously expanding the scope of the company to include the sale of coffee equipment, marked by the acquisition of Western Urn Manufacturing.

When Roy E. Farmer died in 1951 at age 59, his son, Roy F. Farmer assumed control of the company. The transition proved hard on the company as the younger Farmer was forced take the company public in 1952. As Roy F. settled, he was able to greatly improve production efficiency and increase profit margins. In the following years of Roy F. Farmer's tenure as chairman, CEO, and president, the company reached a peak of $240 million in sales in 1998. At this point the company had nearly 100 branches in 29 states in the Western US. At this same time, however, the company became mired in shareholder unrest; shareholders demanded greater transparency into the company's operations and market strategy, wanted executives to work with Wall Street analysts, and wanted independent directors added to the board. Despite this, the company remained fairly private and closed to the public. At the time of Roy F. Farmer's death following a more than 50-year stint heading the company (he was 87) a successor had not been named.[6]
In the years following Farmer's death, Guenter Berger served as chief executive and Roy E. Farmer left the company for a time. Some time later, Roger M. Laverty III was appointed as CEO and President and during his time as Chief Executive, Farmer Brothers acquired Coffee Bean International and the Direct Store Delivery coffee business of Sara Lee. The later acquisition was for a reported $45 million.[7] He served until April 2011. At that point, Jeffrey Wahba (Treasurer and CFO) and Patrick Criteser (President and CEO of Coffee Bean International) were appointed by the board as co-CEOs on an interim basis.[8]
In March 2012, the company appointed a new CEO and President, Michael Keown. Keown came to the company from WhiteWave Foods, a subsidiary of Dean Foods Company.[9] Then on April 15, 2013, Farmer Bros. appointed Mark Nelson as its new CFO.[10]
On April 28, 2015, Farmer Brothers announced that they will be moving their headquarters from Torrance to Northlake, Texas to save about $12-$15 annually.[11] President and CEO Mike Keown said "We will relocate our company headquarters to a state-of-the-art facility in a location central to our nation-wide customer base, and provide incremental manufacturing capacity to support future growth." The new Northlake headquarters is scheduled to open in 2016 and will bring 300 new jobs, becoming Northlake's largest employer.
Public Domain Coffee[edit]
The acquisition of Coffee Bean International by Farmer Brothers was part of the company's expansion into "specialty coffee". As an outgrowth of that initiative, Public Domain was established in April 2010.[12] A subsidiary of Farmer Brothers, Public Domain is the company's flagship coffeehouse which also serves as a lab and training facility for their baristas. The establishment is nationally-recognized and is located in downtown Portland, Oregon (as is the headquarters of Coffee Bean International).[13] In what some reviewers have dubbed a "cautiously designed corporate coffeehouse for high-quality coffee", Farmer Brothers showcases its "top shelf" coffees.[14]

Farmer Bros. Co. is an American coffee foodservice company based in Northlake, Texas. The company specializes in the manufacture and distribution of coffee, tea, and approximately 300 other foodservice items used by restaurants and other establishments.[4] Mike Keown serves as the CEO of the company.
Company history[edit]
In 1912, Roy E. Farmer started a small business roasting coffee beans and selling them door to door in Los Angeles, California. Following a decade of success, Farmer incorporated in 1923 while simultaneously expanding the scope of the company to include the sale of coffee equipment, marked by the acquisition of Western Urn Manufacturing. As the company grew, they began opening branch locations throughout California, quickly establishing a notable presence in developing San Francisco.[5] Starting in the 1930s, Farmer Brothers diversified to include the sale and distribution of not just coffee beans and equipment, but a wider selection of supporting foodservice items.
When Roy E. Farmer died in 1951 at age 59, his son, Roy F. Farmer assumed control of the company. The transition proved hard on the company as the younger Farmer was forced take the company public in 1952. As Roy F. settled, he was able to greatly improve production efficiency and increase profit margins. In the following years of Roy F.

Our Story
Your success is our legacy.

The Farmer Brothers Company: A Time Tested  standard of excellence.



For over a century, the Farmer Brothers company has built our business on providing extraordinary products at incomparable value to coffee-minded food service operators all across the country.
Farmer Brothers company history begins in 1912, when Roy E. Farmer thought it crucial that restaurants serve a quality cup of coffee, yet he couldn’t find one that did. Making and distributing coffee to restaurants and their patrons became his mission. Roy opened Farmer Brothers Coffee Company, headquartered in the back of his brother’s bicycle shop, and did just that.
Over the next 100 years, the Farmer Brothers company continued to evolve and flourish, growing branch by branch and customer by customer. Through a series of product line expansions and acquisitions, and a relentless commitment to continuously invest in customers, service and technology, the Farmer Brothers company has established itself today as a leading national roaster, manufacturer, wholesaler and distributor of high-quality branded and private label coffees, teas, spices and culinary products to foodservice, convenience stores and grocery retailers.
How did we do it? Farmer Brothers company principles, unchanged from their original founding by Roy E. Farmer, have withstood the test of time and continue to guide us in contributing to our success and yours- one customer at a time.

Farmer Brothers Releases Annual Sustainability Report

Press Release Jul. 12, 2017 at 2:02 pm









        More 












Fort Worth, Texas (July 11, 2017) — Farmer Bros. Co. (NASDAQ: FARM) (“Farmer Brothers” or the “Company”), a national coffee roaster, wholesaler and distributor of coffee, tea and culinary products, today released its 2016 Sustainability Report, demonstrating significant advances in using sustainable practices throughout its supply chain.

“We are actively reinforcing our commitment to continuous improvement by holding ourselves accountable to measurable goals that impact people, profit and planet,” said Molly Laverty, Director of Sustainability. “In addition to the progress we’ve made within our organization, Farmer Brothers achieved a significant goal as the first coffee focused company to earn approval for its Science Based Targets.”
During 2016, the Company made considerable progress against its sustainability goals, including:

7.2% reduction in CO2 emitted per kg of coffee sold.
83.9% of the company’s coffee importers have committed to uphold the UN Global Compact in their businesses.
250K gallon reduction in diesel emissions into the atmosphere.

The Company is committed to advancing its social, environmental and economic development (SEED) goals by aligning with core compliance to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and CDP. Working toward the SBTi goals is the natural, next step in evolving the Company’s sustainability program.
The Farmer Brothers full Sustainability Report, along with the accompanying material issue briefs, can be viewed here: http://www.farmerbros.com/2016-Sustainability-Report.pdf

Tea Service





						Tea Service                        



Discover Exceptionality
We think the tea experience should be exceptional, not just acceptable
As one of the most profitable items on a foodservice menu - make sure iced and hot teas are part of your beverage service. Set up a tea service consultation with your local Farmer Brothers specialty tea supplier to find the tea, equipment and tea accompaniments that meet your operational needs. 





Why Choose Farmer Brothers' Tea Service?

 Profit 
As one of the most profitable items on the menu today,  tea can be ordered any time of the day.  With less caffeine than soft drinks, tea is a refreshing, alternative beverage.



 Service
Enjoy the same excellent service with your tea service as you do with your coffee service.  Ask your Farmer Brothers rep about equipment, merchandising and product information.


 Passion
We travel the world to bring you some of the finest tea ingredients including natural flavors and fragrant oils.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
