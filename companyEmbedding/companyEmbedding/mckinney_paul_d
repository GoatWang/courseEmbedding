The law and your lawyer should be on your side. If you want a lawyer who will defend you instead of pressuring you to plead guilty, then call me. I will talk to you in confidence about your case, and I will let you know what my fee would be to defend you all the way through trial.DUI/DWIThe most common arrest for assault in Texas is Assault Causing "Bodily Injury" to a Family Member, which is frequently just called "family violence." Bodily injury is defined essentially as "pain." If she said it hurt, or if the officer figures it must have hurt, then good enough, regardless of whether anything happened or why it happened, if it did. This is one of the more common arrests made, after drugs and DWI. This offense, too, seems to fall upon everyone alike, be they rich or poor, etc. It's not supposed to be this way anymore, but the bottom line is that when a couple gets into an argument or a fight, if the police come, they are very likely going to arrest someone and it's almost always him. Cops will tell you that they have to arrest someone if an allegation of assault is made. Of course, that is absurd, but it's true that that's exactly what they'll do. It's true in part because that is the easiest avenue for the officer: Just arrest someone, file a report repeating what you were told, and now it's someone else's problem. The officer will never get in trouble for arresting someone under these circumstances. That buck generally keeps getting passed until it winds up in a court and until you get someone to defend you. The prosecutor would really appreciate it, too, if you'd just go on and take his "good deal" and plead guilty. That way, he doesn't have to spend more than about 5 minutes dealing with your case.Traffic ViolationsArrest warrants issue for a variety of reasons in Collin County, such as when someone fails to appear in court or fails to pay a fine for a traffic ticket. Likewise, a warrant may issue because of a new criminal charge. For example, if the police are investigating someone for, say, an assault charge, and that person was not arrested initially at the scene when the officer first responded to the call, then the officer may get an arrest warrant. What frequently also happens is that the officer will not get a warrant initially and will forward the report to the Collin County District Attorney's Office, and the DA will file charges. Upon receiving the formal charges, the court will issue a warrant for the person's arrest.Sex CrimesI can't tell you how many people--smart people, people who you would think would know better--ask me, "Paul, how can you defend those people?" "I defend them with all my ability and all my heart," is the answer. It's like the concept that someone could be wrongfully accused of a sex offense is not possible. These otherwise smart people think it's not possible because they don't know how easy it is to make the allegation and how hard it is to defend it. I know that false allegations are possible, and I know it happens. The only thing I can think of that is worse than a child being sexually abused is someone who is wrongfully convicted of a sex offense.BurglaryTheftMisdemeanorsTypically, this offense is a class-a misdemeanor in Texas. These cases can be very tricky, and they're often very hard for the state to prove, and it's not why you would think. Many of the judges in Collin County out there granting protective orders, especially that Johnny Lewis JP in Plano, simply don't know what they're doing, and, often the orders are not even valid, and, if the order isn't valid, then you can't violate it. I don't want to give away too much here because the prosecutors (see you in court, guys!) like to read my website. Don't ever plead guilty to violating a protective order in Collin County before talking to a good lawyer who wants to defend you.Drug CrimesNondisclosure is not near as good as an expunction, but it is still pretty good. A nondisclosure order is an order by a judge that prohibits government agencies from sharing criminal history information with anyone outside of the government. For example, if you obtained a nondisclosure order for a possession of marijuana case, then the officer that stops you for speeding will always be able to see it, but your private employer would not be able to see it, and you would not have to reveal it when applying for a job for example. If you think of a criminal history as a black spot on your record, an expunction completely cleans the spot away and it is no longer there. A nondisclosure order is like a patch used to cover the spot. The government can always look under the patch, but no one else can.AssaultShopliftingTheft is another very common offense and one that cuts across all lines. The most typical theft allegation is either a circumstance of alleged shoplifting or "theft by check." Shoplifting cases are generally pretty straightforward, and, frankly hard to defend. This is not always the case, and I will listen to you and defend you in any way that I can. For those of you, however, that know that this is not a misunderstanding, shoplifting is generally hard to defend from a guilt vs. innocence perspective. There are many other aspects of the case to consider, however. I have frequently been successful in having these charges reduced to class-c misdemeanors, which has allowed the client to ultimately have the case expunged no different than had we gotten the charge dismissed.Restraining OrderSend to PhoneKey, Paul D: Paul D Key2490 W White Ave, Mckinney, TX 75071(972) 562-4446Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailKey, Paul D: Paul D Key2490 W White Ave, Mckinney, TX 75071(972) 562-4446Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.

That experience becomes even more overwhelming when your own attorney starts telling you that the best thing to do is plead guilty because the prosecutor is offering a good deal or because no one is going to believe you. My name is Paul Key, and I am a criminal defense attorney in Collin and Dallas County, Texas. The law and your lawyer should be on your side. If you want a lawyer who will defend you instead of pressuring you to plead guilty, then call me. I will talk to you in confidence about your case, and I will let you know what my fee would be to defend you all the way through trial.I have been practicing law since 1996. After three years of active duty as an Army JAG and another three in the Collin County District Attorney’s office, I went into private practice. Since then my practice has been dedicated to criminal defense, and just about all of my cases are in Collin and Dallas County. I know the DA’s, and I know the judges, and they know me. If you’ve been accused of a crime, call me. I can help you, and I will defend you.
