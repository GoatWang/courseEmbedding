Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

          Colmac purchased 100,000 shares of Common Stock on
  December 18, 1997 for $104,000 of its own funds.  Prior to the
transaction, Colmac owned 400,000 shares of Common Stock.   

Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction.                           

              The acquisition by Colmac of shares of Common Stock of
the Company was made for investment purposes.  Colmac will  
continually evaluate the business, financial condition, and 
prospects of the Company, market price of the Common Stock, 
     return on its investment, alternative investments, and conditions
  in the economy with a view toward determining whether to hold,
   decrease, or increase its investment in shares of Common Stock.
  From time to time, based upon such evaluation, Colmac may sell
   all or a portion of its shares of Common Stock, or may purchase
    additional shares of Common Stock, at varying prices in the open
 market, in privately negotiated transactions, and/or in other
transactions.                                               

               Colmac has not made any plans or proposals which relate
to or would result in: (i) an extraordinary corporate       
 transaction, such as a merger, reorganization, or liquidation
involving the Company; (ii) a sale or transfer of a material
    amount of assets of the Company; (iii) any change in the present
Board of Directors of the Company, including any plans or   
     proposals to change the number of or term of Directors or to fill
    any existing vacancies on the Board; (iv) any material change in
    the Company's business or corporate structure including, but not
 limited to, any plans or proposals to make any changes in its
   investment policy for which a vote is required by Section 13 of
    the Investment Company Act of 1940; (v) changes in the Company's
     charter, by-laws, or instruments corresponding thereto or actions
     which may impede the acquisition of control of the Company by any
   person; (vi) causing a class of securities of the Company to be
     delisted from a national securities association or to cease to be
    authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a
registered national securities association; (vii) a class of
equity securities of the Company becoming eligible for      
   termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the

any of those enumerated above.                              

Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer.             

           (a)  Colmac owns beneficially, and has the power to
    vote and dispose of, 500,000 shares or approximately 8.8% of the
outstanding Common Stock of the Company.  Because Willis S. 
     McLeese has the power to direct the voting and disposition of the
  shares owned by Colmac, he may be deemed to have shared voting
and dispositive power with respect to such shares.  The     
 calculation of the percentage of outstanding Common Stock set
forth herein is based upon 5,708,034 shares of Common Stock 
outstanding as of September 30, 1997.                       

               (b)  As the principal owner and chief executive officer
   of Colmac, Willis S. McLeese has the power to direct the voting
     and disposition of the shares of Common Stock owned by Colmac and
may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of them.           

            (c)  On 12/18/97, Colmac purchased 100,000 shares of
Common Stock in an open market transaction.                 

Item 6.   Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or        
               Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.

               Pursuant to the terms of the private offering described
in 5(c) above, the Company agreed to file a registration    
   statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Act of 1933 to register the offer and sale by the
purchasers in the private offering of as many of the shares 
  purchased as the individual purchasers may wishes to sell in a
delayed or continuous offering of such shares to the public.
There are no other contracts, arrangements, understandings, 
  agreements, or relationships (legal or otherwise) among Colmac
and any person with respect to securities of the Company.   

Item 7.   Material filed as Exhibits.                       

None.
