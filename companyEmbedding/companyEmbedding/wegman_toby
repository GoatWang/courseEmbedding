585-429-3627 or 585-301-8009
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE — March 23, 2015 — ROCHESTER, NY — Wegmans Food Markets, Inc. is recalling approximately 12,540 packages of Wegmans Organic Food You Feel Good About Just Picked Frozen Spinach, 12 oz. (UPC 77890-32932) due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The product was sold in the frozen food department of the company’s 85 stores in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, and Massachusetts between January 27 and March 21, 2015.

L. monocytogenes is a bacterium that can contaminate foods and cause a mild non-invasive illness (called listerial gastroenteritis) or a severe, sometimes life-threatening, illness (called invasive listeriosis). Persons who have the greatest risk of experiencing listeriosis after consuming foods contaminated with L. monocytogenes are fetuses and neonates who are infected after the mother is exposed to L. monocytogenes during pregnancy, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems. Customers who have experienced these symptoms and are concerned should contact their physician.
No illnesses associated with this recall have been reported to date.
Wegmans will place automated phone calls to customers who purchased the product using their Shoppers Club card. Customers who purchased the recalled products from Wegmans should return it to the service desk for a full refund.
