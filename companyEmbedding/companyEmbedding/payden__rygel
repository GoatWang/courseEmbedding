Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Preperations
Payden & Rygel has developed a Business Continuity Plan to ensure that all critical functions continue in the event of a disruption in normal operations.
The firm has configured data replication servers and related infrastructure in its Boston, Massachusetts office. Data on critical Los Angeles servers is replicated to corresponding servers in the Boston location on a live basis throughout each day. In addition, other servers and databases are backed up, sent electronically to Boston, and restored at the end of each day. The firm has established a dedicated high-speed connection between the Los Angeles and Boston offices to facilitate the secure transmission of data backups.
A number of individuals from the Trading, Portfolio Operations, Information Technology, Compliance and Portfolio Management departments have been selected to connect remotely to the Boston office to complete their daily responsibilities, in the event of a disruption to normal business operations. The firm has implemented a VMWare virtual environment for each of these individuals so that they each have their own remote desktop in Boston to which they securely connect using a laptop or desktop computer with an Internet connection. Our expectation is that routine business operations will resume within 24 hours of a business continuity event. In addition, the Boston office has capacity to accommodate additional employees if a physical relocation of selected Los Angeles employees is necessary.
The firm uses a third-party hosted mass notification system to quickly communicate with all employees in the event of a disruption in operations. The system allows management to compose a text or voice message notifying employees of the event, which is then sent automatically to employees' mobile phones, home phones, and e-mail addresses. Employees indicate their receipt of the message from their phone or mobile device, which allows management to immediately review summary reports of the employees who are aware of the disruption. Additional instructions and updates can then be sent to all staff, as necessary under the circumstances.
In the event that our Business Continuity Plan is activated and Los Angeles office phone lines are down, the Los Angeles phone numbers are re-directed to the Boston office. Boston-based staff will direct callers to the mobile phones of key portfolio professionals, as necessary. All key investment personnel have access to firm e-mail on mobile devices. E-mail delivery to Payden & Rygel addresses is not dependent on the availability of either Los Angeles or Boston servers. Finally, Boston-based staff has access to portfolio management and reporting information independent of Los Angeles technology availability.
The transfer agent for the Paydenfunds is not located in Payden & Rygel's offices. The transfer agent for all of the funds maintains all shareholder records and will continue to receive all shareholder calls related to their accounts.
On at least a quarterly basis, several employees from the departments specified above will remotely connect to the Boston office to test the infrastructure by conducting their daily job responsibilities, including the execution, ticketing, settlement and processing of securities trades.
The Business Continuity Plan was developed and is monitored by a committee of senior managers, including the heads of the Trading, Portfolio Operations, Compliance and Information Technology departments. The committee meets regularly to discuss any necessary updates to the Plan and coordinates ongoing tests of the Boston location by a team of employees from various departments. The committee also solicits feedback from personnel based on the ongoing tests and promptly makes adjustments to the Plan and the Boston office resources, as necessary.
Updates to the Business Continuity Plan will be posted on this website page and a copy of the Plan may also be obtained by written request.

Who we are

We are one of the largest privately-owned global investment advisers. Founded in 1983, we are a leader in the active management of fixed income and equity portfolios, through domestic and international solutions. Advising the world's leading institutions and individual investors, we provide strong performance and real-world strategy on the global economy and capital markets.




Payden & Rygel at a Glance
 






$110 billion in AUM
Founded in 1983





375 client relationships
Headquartered in Los Angeles





Offices in Boston, London, and Paris
200 employees






For over three decades, our independence has enabled us to manage portfolios focused on our clients' objectives. We build lasting relationships by providing an unparalleled level of service and problem solving.
                        







Independence
Payden & Rygel is one of the largest independent asset managers. 100% of the company is owned by senior portfolio managers and executives involved in the day-to-day direction of the firm. This "true" independence provides our clients with a high level of customization and access to our resources.





Tenure and Stability
Our company is only 34 years "young", yet the senior management team has been working together, on average, for nearly 25 years! The firm's independence has contributed to stability in management and staff uncommon in our industry. Our investment professionals have extensive capital markets experience, which our clients draw upon daily.





Global Presence
We provide a full range of investment strategies to clients around the globe. With investment professionals in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and the United States, we are well-positioned to collaboratively manage portfolios across a breadth of mandates. Payden & Rygel Global Limited, our London-based subsidiary, provides a wide variety of investment services to clients in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the Middle East, in separately-managed accounts and Dublin-domiciled UCITS funds.





Size
With assets under management of over $110 billion, Payden & Rygel is large enough to assure the most competitive bond prices - yet small enough that we can invest exclusively in cash instruments. We are not forced to use derivatives to gain exposure.





Customization
Our independent culture allows us to customize portfolios based on each client's special objectives. Managing unique mandates is a hallmark of our firm.





Risk Management
Our process has always focused on a very basic principle - an investment portfolio should behave in a manner consistent with the client's objectives. As simple as this sounds, disasters in stock and bond portfolios over the past 20 years have occurred when investment managers have taken aggressive positions that were allowed under the letter of the client's guidelines, but were not consistent with the spirit of the client's objectives.

Our strategies








We provide a number of strategies across global markets. Strategies are customized based on each client's objectives, but fall into four broad categories: fixed income, equity, absolute return, and balanced.  Strategies can be employed using customized separate accounts, our US mutual funds, or Dublin-based UCITS funds.
							
Payden & Rygel has been managing portfolios globally with an emphasis on customized investment solutions since inception. We believe that a one-size-fits-all or product-based approach to investing sacrifices the single most important aspect of our client relationships: each client's unique circumstances.

Emerging Market Bond
Some of the fastest growing regions in the world are labeled "emerging markets". For many years, investors treated emerging markets as an alternative investment. Today, emerging marketsand in particular, emerging market bondsare an exciting asset class all their own. They offer the opportunity to invest in almost seventy countries that represent close to half of global output. Payden & Rygel's Emerging Market Bond strategies can be used as stand-alone investment vehicles or they can used in a broader portfolio to provide diversification and potentially enhance returns.
The firm's investment process starts with a top-down assessment of country risk, accompanied by research trips to countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We assess country trajectories through a screening of their macroeconomic variables, business environment, political stability, and the quality of their environmental, social and government institutions. Our robust relative value and risk management tools help to ensure diversification and minimize volatility.
Payden & Rygel's emerging market bond effort dates back to the late 1990s, making us a pioneer in the asset class. The stability of our team and consistency of our approach has delivered strong absolute and risk-adjusted returns for our clients. Beyond the firm's capabilities in sovereign US dollar and euro-denominated bonds, we have been at the forefront of the evolution of local currency and corporate bond markets. We offer both dedicated and blended strategies across the full range of emerging market debt opportunities.

Cash Management
Payden & Rygel is a pioneer in developing cash management strategies for institutions, which we began more than a quarter-century ago. Since then, this strategy, which focuses on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds, has been refined and enhanced. Our strategy helps institutions maximize the return on short-term resources by deploying funds in the short-term money marketswhere they maintain a high degree of security and liquidity. The money markets include short-term debt securities like commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and Treasury Billsall with maturities of less than a year, but usually less than 90 days. Expert navigation of the vast money markets is essential to successfully managing short-term cash.

Enhanced Cash/Low duration/low duration plus
Payden & Rygel pioneered cash management strategies for institutions nearly three decades ago. Since that time, our short-term bond strategies, which initially focused on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds, have expanded to meet the dynamic needs of our clients and the ever-changing investment landscape. 
Our short-term bond strategies are designed for investors who seek higher yields than those provided by money market funds but can withstand varying amounts of incremental price volatility. Customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client, the firm's short-term bond strategies offer a high quality, diversified alternative to money market funds and other short-term investments. 
Today, Payden & Rygel's short-term bond strategies generally fall into three broad categories: enhanced cash, low duration and low duration plus.
Enhanced Cash
The enhanced cash strategy offers a higher yielding alternative to short-term investments such as money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. Short-maturity government securities and non-government securities such as corporate bonds, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are utilized to provide potentially higher yields than money market funds while seeking to achieve a comparable level of principal stability.

Average Credit Quality

Low Duration
The low duration strategy is an alternative to cash and short-term bank deposits, designed for investors seeking higher yields than generally available from money market funds, and who are slightly more tolerant of principal fluctuation. The portfolio structure is based upon a client's liquidity requirements. Typical clients include corporate operating funds, construction funds, hedge funds, university operating funds, pension funds, central banks, foundations/endowments, public funds and individuals. 
Low duration investments range from money markets, asset- and mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, US and international securities.

Low Duration Plus
The low duration plus strategy is designed for investors who seek a potentially higher return than that available from a pure low duration strategy and who can withstand a moderate amount of principal fluctuation. While this strategy employs the same type of securities as the low duration strategy (e.g., short maturity government and non-government securities, including corporate bonds, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities), it may also include investments with a slightly longer maturity and a lower credit quality. The overall portfolio maintains a similar credit quality to the low duration strategy.

The value of fixed income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors.  Investment portfolios could lose principal.


Intermediate/Core/Core Plus
Payden & Rygel believes that bonds play a special and important role in an overall asset allocation by generating reliable current income and by providing a diversification benefit to other higher volatility assets in the portfolio. We strive to act as a requisite diversifier in the context of the total pension plan.
With the ever-increasing blurring between asset classes, we expect to deliver return and volatility characteristics in keeping with the spirit of bond expectations. We believe that bond portfolios should be sufficiently diversified across a broad spectrum of sectors and that individual position sizes in the portfolio should be calibrated to their potential degree of risk.
In addition to the strategies listed below, we offer a complete array of services including index replication strategies and liability-driven investing.
Intermediate
Our Intermediate Core Bond strategy strikes a compromise between yield on the one hand and price volatility on the other. This strategy offers a slightly lower yield than other core bond alternatives due to its shorter average maturity that helps protect against adverse price moves in a rising interest rate environment. The strategy generally invests in securities with maturities in the one to 10-year range, and includes sectors such as Treasuries, Agencies, investment-grade corporate bonds and asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities.

Core
The Core Bond strategy exploits opportunities across maturities and sectors in the investment grade universe. The strategy generally invests in securities with maturities in the one to 30-year range and includes sectors such as Treasuries, Agencies, investment-grade corporates and asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities.

Core Plus
Our Core Plus strategy combines sectors used in the core strategy with the extended markets of high-yield, emerging markets and non-dollar bonds. They are used opportunistically as market conditions warrant and may represent as little as zero percent of the portfolio, but a more typical allocation is in the 10-20% range. This strategy has grown steadily over the past several years, spurred by advancements in information technology, which have increased transparency and trading efficiencies in these sectors, and the dramatic increase of debt issuance in local markets around the world.

US Government Bonds
Our US Government Bond strategy is a high quality, short to intermediate maturity strategy, for risk averse investors.  The Fund is comprised of 100% US Government securities. The strategy focuses on US Treasury securities, government agency debentures and agency mortgage securities with a weighted average life of one to five years. The strategy seeks to generate income without credit risk nor the volatility of longer maturity securities.

Global Fixed Income
Payden & Rygel's actively managed Global Fixed Income strategies provide broad access to the world's developed and emerging bond markets, both investment grade and high yield. We offer a wide range of standard and customized strategies designed to meet clients' unique objectives across countries, currencies and sectors.
Three pillars drive portfolio success: duration, currency and sector. We combine top-down asset allocation decisions with bottom-up security selection to gauge country selection, interest rate expectations, and currency and sector performance. Diversification across sectors and individual credits is a key component of our risk management philosophy. 
Global
Global Fixed Income strategies aim to maximize total return in both rising and falling interest rate environments. Investing across global bond markets provides increased opportunities and additional diversification. Payden & Rygel uses a disciplined team approach to tailor portfolios for both hedged and unhedged mandates.

The value of fixed income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors.  Investment portfolios could lose principal.


High Yield
Payden & Rygel's high-yield bond strategy seeks to maximize total return by focusing on the upper tier of the high-yield bond market. High-yield bonds can provide diversification and yield benefits to an investment portfolio due to their low correlation with both Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds.
The cornerstone of Payden & Rygel's high-yield strategy is its intensive credit due diligence. With an experienced portfolio manager and a seasoned analyst team, Payden & Rygel successfully navigated the credit market turmoil in both 2007 and 2008. The firm prides itself on its risk controls and risk discipline.
We consider all companies which have bonds above $200 million in issue size. Our investible universe consists of in excess of 620 companies, though 245 of these are between $200-$300 million in issue size. These 245 companies often provide the best value and are "below the radar" of many managers. This allows us to focus on more "undiscovered gems" than the typical high yield manager.

Tax-Exempt Strategies
Tax-exempt bonds (e.g., municipal bonds) should be a significant holding in a fixed-income strategy for taxable investors. Payden & Rygel's tax-sensitive strategies seek to maximize after-tax total return and are customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client as well as clients' tax status and state of domicile.
We believe that superior performance is derived through the inclusion of both taxable and tax-exempt securities in the portfolio opportunity set. The segmented nature of the municipal (tax-exempt) market leads to inefficiencies that can translate into excess returns for those managers with the experience, sophistication and flexibility to capitalize on these opportunities. We believe municipal investing requires elements of both a top-down, as well as bottom-up, investment style. Market surveillance plays a critical role in the municipal market given the significant influence that supply and demand imbalances exert on performance.
Short Term
Short-term Tax Sensitive strategies seek to earn higher income than money market alternatives while preserving capital. Short-maturity municipal bonds as well as Treasury, Agency, corporate and asset-backed bonds may be used.

Intermediate
The Intermediate strategy is a core portfolio strategy. The intermediate maturities along the yield curve provide a large portion of the return of longer securities with a fraction of the price volatility. The portfolios are tailored to meet each client's unique investment goals and tolerance for risk and can be customized to emphasize in-state tax benefits where appropriate.

The Long-term strategy is designed for investors who may have long-term liabilities against which they are managing their assets or those with a more income oriented focus. The strategy generally invests in securities across the entire maturity spectrum, and includes sectors such as government securities and mortgage-backed securities in addition to traditional municipal securities.

The value of fixed income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors.  Investment portfolios could lose principal.


Strategic Income
Strategic Income has its roots in core fixed income but expands from there in a more comprehensive and opportunistic fashion.  It is designed as a more "open architecture" approach that is less conforming to traditional fixed income benchmarks.
This approach has gained favor from investors who recognize that there should not be a "one size fits all approach to core style portfolios.  Clients have many different degrees of liquidity needs and beta exposure desires and strategic income in the way we manage it at Payden & Rygel offers this degree of customization.
The strategy allocates to major credit sectors globally in a diversified fashion. Short term and/or high-quality government securities will also be used to ensure liquidity and ease of strategy change, as well as potentially providing a "safe haven" in times of major credit stress. Active rotation among the sectors follows Payden's time-tested macro view through its Investment Policy Committee and coordination with our Core fixed income team. The Payden style of "bonds behaving like bonds should" is not lost in Strategic Income portfolios - our focus is on cash bonds and not derivative strategies that can obfuscate risk and return sources.
Importantly, effective (interest rate) duration may be empirically lower than traditional "core" portfolio durations given the strategic allocations to credit sectors and resulting higher income cushion.

Investment Grade Corporates
Payden & Rygel’s strategy is to purchase investment-grade corporate bonds of companies that have leading market positions, strong cash flow generation, stable management teams and predictable earnings. The strategy’s focus is on bottom-up credit selection with an emphasis placed on adding issues with a near-term catalyst to outperform. Our credit research process looks to capitalise on opportunities in the corporate bond market across sectors and maturities; including the early identification of potential rising stars - companies that we believe will be upgraded to investment grade in the near term. A forward looking approach is taken to credit analysis. A priority is placed on assessing a company’s future trajectory and the corresponding risk and opportunities for bondholders under various scenarios.
The strategy primarily invests in USD investment grade corporate securities with flexibility to opportunistically invest in below investment grade securities.  The strategy may also utilize futures for duration management.

Long-Duration Investing (LDI)
Payden & Rygel’s investment philosophy for Long-Duration Investing (LDI) is that active management of fixed-income investments not only should focus on ways to add value relative to a benchmark, but should also focus on managing risk in its many forms (e.g., credit, liquidity, etc.) consistent with the letter and spirit of our clients’ unique investment guidelines.
Our investment process is a hybrid – we manage a macro-driven top-down approach combined with a bottom-up fundamental view. The process begins with our Investment Policy Committee’s assessment of the global macro-economic environment and formation of our broad-based and long-term view on interest rates (economic growth, inflation, political risk), credit (direction, strength, supply/demand), and risk (primarily focused on downside risk and client portfolio protection). The long duration investment team, based on discussions with the IPC and our sector strategists, will determine sector weightings and then populate these targets with individual issuers to achieve attractive risk-adjusted return expectations.
We maintain diversified portfolios, typically holding 200 bonds, in order to properly manage tracking error and we employ strong risk controls. Our LDI strategy exploits opportunities in the longer end of the maturity curve, ten years and greater, across multiple fixed income. These sectors include U.S. Treasuries, Agencies, global investment-grade corporate bonds, taxable municipal bonds, and investment grade emerging market sovereign and government related bonds. Plain vanilla interest rate swaps and interest rate futures will be used sparingly to manage the duration of the portfolio. Additionally, we invest in sub-investment grade bonds up to 5% to increase income potential and diversify overall credit exposures.

Payden & Rygel's Large-Cap Value / Equity Income strategy takes advantage of the firm's strengths in company and industry analysis, focusing on companies which are projected to maintain or increase their dividend payouts while providing above-market-average dividend yields. Our objective is to provide current income and equity market participation through a well-diversified, high-quality, large-cap portfolio by focusing on companies with steady earnings and cash flow growth.  Our equity team looks beyond the common stock universe for attractive dividend/distribution yields, and researches other areas such as preferred stock, real estate investment trusts, master limited partnerships and business development companies.
The strategy is well-diversified across sectors and equity security types, and generally invests in 50-70 holdings. With the focus on diversification, income and equity market participation, this strategy is appropriate for both investors focusing on income and those looking for a competitive large-cap value offering with lower volatility and attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Stocks in this strategy will generally appreciate less when than the overall market is rising and fall less when the overall market is declining. Investors could lose money during periods of falling stock prices.


The "Absolute Return" investing universe has represented a variety of investment objectives and approaches through time.  Even today the term is used by both hedge funds, on one end of the spectrum, as well as ultra-safe, liquidity type funds, on the other. While the space has yet to be concretely defined, the development of our strategy began with a simple client request to manage a portfolio, untethered from traditional benchmarks, that would produce a reasonable level of return and protect their investment principal. With that objective in mind, the Payden Absolute Return Investing (PARI) approach has been refined over more than 7 years while adhering to the following core objectives:


Produce Positive ReturnsStaying true to the basic definition of "Absolute Return", our strategy aims to produce positive returns with a performance hurdle of LIBOR + 2-3% over a rolling 3-year period.
Protect Downside RiskBefore we consider the direction of markets or the value opportunities that are presented, our first responsibility is to protect an investor's principal against the potential for loss. Risk management is paramount.
Capture "Smart" YieldBenefitting from more than 30 years in fixed income management, the foundation of our strategy is a low duration fixed income portfolio where risk premia from global interest rate curves and credit markets may provide dependable and repeatable returns.

Global Balanced
Payden & Rygel's Global Balanced strategy is designed to help investors meet their financial goals and objectives via a strategic allocation of stocks, bonds and cash.
Country and sector allocations are carefully determined via a top-down approach based on fundamental and quantitative analysis. The correlation between countries is critical to measure appropriate levels of diversification. We utilize futures contracts to implement strategic allocation shifts. High liquidity and low transaction costs are added benefits to Payden & Rygel's proven approach.
Us Balanced
Payden & Rygel's US Balanced portfolio is designed to help clients achieve their financial objectives via a diversified list of U.S. stocks, bonds and cash. The firm can manage mandates for a relative return or absolute return objective.
A portfolio of stocks and bonds is determined using a selection process which considers fundamental economic analysis, valuation measures for stocks and bonds, global asset flows, technical analysis, and overall client goals and objectives. While we utilize extensive quantitative analysis, common sense and good judgment are also key components of our selection process. The strategy generally makes one to four shifts per year, usually changing the allocation mix in five to ten percent increments.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Preperations
Payden & Rygel has developed a Business Continuity Plan to ensure that all critical functions continue in the event of a disruption in normal operations.
The firm has configured data replication servers and related infrastructure in its Boston, Massachusetts office. Data on critical Los Angeles servers is replicated to corresponding servers in the Boston location on a live basis throughout each day. In addition, other servers and databases are backed up, sent electronically to Boston, and restored at the end of each day. The firm has established a dedicated high-speed connection between the Los Angeles and Boston offices to facilitate the secure transmission of data backups.
A number of individuals from the Trading, Portfolio Operations, Information Technology, Compliance and Portfolio Management departments have been selected to connect remotely to the Boston office to complete their daily responsibilities, in the event of a disruption to normal business operations. The firm has implemented a VMWare virtual environment for each of these individuals so that they each have their own remote desktop in Boston to which they securely connect using a laptop or desktop computer with an Internet connection. Our expectation is that routine business operations will resume within 24 hours of a business continuity event. In addition, the Boston office has capacity to accommodate additional employees if a physical relocation of selected Los Angeles employees is necessary.
The firm uses a third-party hosted mass notification system to quickly communicate with all employees in the event of a disruption in operations. The system allows management to compose a text or voice message notifying employees of the event, which is then sent automatically to employees' mobile phones, home phones, and e-mail addresses. Employees indicate their receipt of the message from their phone or mobile device, which allows management to immediately review summary reports of the employees who are aware of the disruption. Additional instructions and updates can then be sent to all staff, as necessary under the circumstances.
In the event that our Business Continuity Plan is activated and Los Angeles office phone lines are down, the Los Angeles phone numbers are re-directed to the Boston office. Boston-based staff will direct callers to the mobile phones of key portfolio professionals, as necessary. All key investment personnel have access to firm e-mail on mobile devices. E-mail delivery to Payden & Rygel addresses is not dependent on the availability of either Los Angeles or Boston servers. Finally, Boston-based staff has access to portfolio management and reporting information independent of Los Angeles technology availability.
The transfer agent for the Paydenfunds is not located in Payden & Rygel's offices. The transfer agent for all of the funds maintains all shareholder records and will continue to receive all shareholder calls related to their accounts.
On at least a quarterly basis, several employees from the departments specified above will remotely connect to the Boston office to test the infrastructure by conducting their daily job responsibilities, including the execution, ticketing, settlement and processing of securities trades.
The Business Continuity Plan was developed and is monitored by a committee of senior managers, including the heads of the Trading, Portfolio Operations, Compliance and Information Technology departments. The committee meets regularly to discuss any necessary updates to the Plan and coordinates ongoing tests of the Boston location by a team of employees from various departments. The committee also solicits feedback from personnel based on the ongoing tests and promptly makes adjustments to the Plan and the Boston office resources, as necessary.
Updates to the Business Continuity Plan will be posted on this website page and a copy of the Plan may also be obtained by written request.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Payden & Rygel, the Los Angeles-based global asset manager, announced today the launch of the Payden Absolute Return Bond Fund (PYARX), an open-end fund which will invest across the spectrum of fixed income sectors.  The strategy, launched over six years ago for institutions, aims to generate incremental absolute returns while managing downside risk.
"We are pleased to offer our absolute return strategy to a wider set of investors through the launch of the Payden Absolute Return Bond Fund.  It brings together the strengths of our investment expertise across regions and sector disciplines combined with the practical approach to risk management for which we are known," said Joan Payden at Payden & Rygel.
The fund can move dynamically among fixed income sectors and individual securities to achieve its LIBOR + 3% return objective.  It takes advantage of Payden's broad investment resources by incorporating the most compelling risk-adjusted opportunities from each sector team. A special emphasis is placed on risk management and mitigating potential downside. 
In the current environment, bond markets face several challenges including historically low yields and dangerously thin margins of safety - should interest rates rise. "By removing conventional bond benchmarks, maintaining flexibility and sourcing value from Payden's extensive bench of investment professionals, the Payden Absolute Return Bond Fund aims to overcome these challenges," said Brad Boyd, portfolio manager.  
As a leader in fixed income for more than 30 years, Payden has been at the forefront of investment innovations and solutions for global investors. 
For more information about the fund or to see a prospectus, visit payden.com.

 Payden & Rygel Global Equity Investment Strategies

       Payden & Rygel’s global equity strategy uses active                     selection of countries, sectors, and currencies to drive investment                     returns.                      The global equity product does not select individual stocks                     for the portfolio. Our experienced global equity team invests                     in a portfolio of stock index futures, exchange traded funds,                     and swaps to express country, sector, and currency overweights                     and underweights. The portfolio does not employ leverage,                     as each dollar, euro, or yen invested is backed by short-term                     fixed income instruments. Our philosophy has been supported                     by several academic studies which confirm the importance of                     country and sector selection.                     The Payden & Rygel global equity product is managed as                     a core product, without a growth or value style bias. This                     unique approach has been successfully employed for Payden                     & Rygel institutional clients since 1997.                     Countries in which the Payden & Rygel Global Equity product                     has recently invested: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,                     France, Germany, Hong Kong/China, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South                     Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United                     States.                   More information on Payden & Rygel's fixed-income,         equity and balanced investment strategies.

Who we are

We are one of the largest privately-owned global investment advisers. Founded in 1983, we are a leader in the active management of fixed income and equity portfolios, through domestic and international solutions. Advising the world's leading institutions and individual investors, we provide strong performance and real-world strategy on the global economy and capital markets.




Payden & Rygel at a Glance
 






$110 billion in AUM
Founded in 1983





375 client relationships
Headquartered in Los Angeles





Offices in Boston, London, and Paris
200 employees






For over three decades, our independence has enabled us to manage portfolios focused on our clients' objectives. We build lasting relationships by providing an unparalleled level of service and problem solving.
                        







Independence
Payden & Rygel is one of the largest independent asset managers. 100% of the company is owned by senior portfolio managers and executives involved in the day-to-day direction of the firm. This "true" independence provides our clients with a high level of customization and access to our resources.





Tenure and Stability
Our company is only 34 years "young", yet the senior management team has been working together, on average, for nearly 25 years! The firm's independence has contributed to stability in management and staff uncommon in our industry. Our investment professionals have extensive capital markets experience, which our clients draw upon daily.





Global Presence
We provide a full range of investment strategies to clients around the globe. With investment professionals in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and the United States, we are well-positioned to collaboratively manage portfolios across a breadth of mandates. Payden & Rygel Global Limited, our London-based subsidiary, provides a wide variety of investment services to clients in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the Middle East, in separately-managed accounts and Dublin-domiciled UCITS funds.





Size
With assets under management of over $110 billion, Payden & Rygel is large enough to assure the most competitive bond prices - yet small enough that we can invest exclusively in cash instruments. We are not forced to use derivatives to gain exposure.





Customization
Our independent culture allows us to customize portfolios based on each client's special objectives. Managing unique mandates is a hallmark of our firm.





Risk Management
Our process has always focused on a very basic principle - an investment portfolio should behave in a manner consistent with the client's objectives. As simple as this sounds, disasters in stock and bond portfolios over the past 20 years have occurred when investment managers have taken aggressive positions that were allowed under the letter of the client's guidelines, but were not consistent with the spirit of the client's objectives.

Our strategies








We provide a number of strategies across global markets. Strategies are customized based on each client's objectives, but fall into four broad categories: fixed income, equity, absolute return, and balanced.  Strategies can be employed using customized separate accounts, our US mutual funds, or Dublin-based UCITS funds.
							
Payden & Rygel has been managing portfolios globally with an emphasis on customized investment solutions since inception. We believe that a one-size-fits-all or product-based approach to investing sacrifices the single most important aspect of our client relationships: each client's unique circumstances.

Emerging Market Bond
Some of the fastest growing regions in the world are labeled "emerging markets". For many years, investors treated emerging markets as an alternative investment. Today, emerging marketsand in particular, emerging market bondsare an exciting asset class all their own. They offer the opportunity to invest in almost seventy countries that represent close to half of global output. Payden & Rygel's Emerging Market Bond strategies can be used as stand-alone investment vehicles or they can used in a broader portfolio to provide diversification and potentially enhance returns.
The firm's investment process starts with a top-down assessment of country risk, accompanied by research trips to countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We assess country trajectories through a screening of their macroeconomic variables, business environment, political stability, and the quality of their environmental, social and government institutions. Our robust relative value and risk management tools help to ensure diversification and minimize volatility.
Payden & Rygel's emerging market bond effort dates back to the late 1990s, making us a pioneer in the asset class. The stability of our team and consistency of our approach has delivered strong absolute and risk-adjusted returns for our clients. Beyond the firm's capabilities in sovereign US dollar and euro-denominated bonds, we have been at the forefront of the evolution of local currency and corporate bond markets. We offer both dedicated and blended strategies across the full range of emerging market debt opportunities.

The value of fixed income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors.  Investment portfolios could lose principal.


Cash Management
Payden & Rygel is a pioneer in developing cash management strategies for institutions, which we began more than a quarter-century ago. Since then, this strategy, which focuses on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds, has been refined and enhanced. Our strategy helps institutions maximize the return on short-term resources by deploying funds in the short-term money marketswhere they maintain a high degree of security and liquidity. The money markets include short-term debt securities like commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and Treasury Billsall with maturities of less than a year, but usually less than 90 days. Expert navigation of the vast money markets is essential to successfully managing short-term cash.

Enhanced Cash/Low duration/low duration plus
Payden & Rygel pioneered cash management strategies for institutions nearly three decades ago. Since that time, our short-term bond strategies, which initially focused on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds, have expanded to meet the dynamic needs of our clients and the ever-changing investment landscape. 
Our short-term bond strategies are designed for investors who seek higher yields than those provided by money market funds but can withstand varying amounts of incremental price volatility. Customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client, the firm's short-term bond strategies offer a high quality, diversified alternative to money market funds and other short-term investments. 
Today, Payden & Rygel's short-term bond strategies generally fall into three broad categories: enhanced cash, low duration and low duration plus.
Enhanced Cash
The enhanced cash strategy offers a higher yielding alternative to short-term investments such as money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. Short-maturity government securities and non-government securities such as corporate bonds, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are utilized to provide potentially higher yields than money market funds while seeking to achieve a comparable level of principal stability.

Maturity Range
0 - 5 years


Duration Range
0.25 - 1.5 years


Average Credit Quality
AA


Low Duration
The low duration strategy is an alternative to cash and short-term bank deposits, designed for investors seeking higher yields than generally available from money market funds, and who are slightly more tolerant of principal fluctuation. The portfolio structure is based upon a client's liquidity requirements. Typical clients include corporate operating funds, construction funds, hedge funds, university operating funds, pension funds, central banks, foundations/endowments, public funds and individuals. 
Low duration investments range from money markets, asset- and mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, US and international securities.

Securities Employed

Maturity Range

Duration Range
1.5 - 2.5 years


Average Credit Quality
AA


Low Duration Plus
The low duration plus strategy is designed for investors who seek a potentially higher return than that available from a pure low duration strategy and who can withstand a moderate amount of principal fluctuation. While this strategy employs the same type of securities as the low duration strategy (e.g., short maturity government and non-government securities, including corporate bonds, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities), it may also include investments with a slightly longer maturity and a lower credit quality. The overall portfolio maintains a similar credit quality to the low duration strategy.

The value of fixed income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors.  Investment portfolios could lose principal.


Intermediate/Core/Core Plus
Payden & Rygel believes that bonds play a special and important role in an overall asset allocation by generating reliable current income and by providing a diversification benefit to other higher volatility assets in the portfolio. We strive to act as a requisite diversifier in the context of the total pension plan.
With the ever-increasing blurring between asset classes, we expect to deliver return and volatility characteristics in keeping with the spirit of bond expectations. We believe that bond portfolios should be sufficiently diversified across a broad spectrum of sectors and that individual position sizes in the portfolio should be calibrated to their potential degree of risk.
In addition to the strategies listed below, we offer a complete array of services including index replication strategies and liability-driven investing.
Intermediate
Our Intermediate Core Bond strategy strikes a compromise between yield on the one hand and price volatility on the other. This strategy offers a slightly lower yield than other core bond alternatives due to its shorter average maturity that helps protect against adverse price moves in a rising interest rate environment. The strategy generally invests in securities with maturities in the one to 10-year range, and includes sectors such as Treasuries, Agencies, investment-grade corporate bonds and asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities.

Core
The Core Bond strategy exploits opportunities across maturities and sectors in the investment grade universe.

Core Plus
Our Core Plus strategy combines sectors used in the core strategy with the extended markets of high-yield, emerging markets and non-dollar bonds. They are used opportunistically as market conditions warrant and may represent as little as zero percent of the portfolio, but a more typical allocation is in the 10-20% range. This strategy has grown steadily over the past several years, spurred by advancements in information technology, which have increased transparency and trading efficiencies in these sectors, and the dramatic increase of debt issuance in local markets around the world.

US Government Bonds
Our US Government Bond strategy is a high quality, short to intermediate maturity strategy, for risk averse investors.  The Fund is comprised of 100% US Government securities. The strategy focuses on US Treasury securities, government agency debentures and agency mortgage securities with a weighted average life of one to five years. The strategy seeks to generate income without credit risk nor the volatility of longer maturity securities.

Global Fixed Income
Payden & Rygel's actively managed Global Fixed Income strategies provide broad access to the world's developed and emerging bond markets, both investment grade and high yield. We offer a wide range of standard and customized strategies designed to meet clients' unique objectives across countries, currencies and sectors.
Three pillars drive portfolio success: duration, currency and sector. We combine top-down asset allocation decisions with bottom-up security selection to gauge country selection, interest rate expectations, and currency and sector performance. Diversification across sectors and individual credits is a key component of our risk management philosophy. 
Global
Global Fixed Income strategies aim to maximize total return in both rising and falling interest rate environments. Investing across global bond markets provides increased opportunities and additional diversification. Payden & Rygel uses a disciplined team approach to tailor portfolios for both hedged and unhedged mandates.

High Yield
Payden & Rygel's high-yield bond strategy seeks to maximize total return by focusing on the upper tier of the high-yield bond market. High-yield bonds can provide diversification and yield benefits to an investment portfolio due to their low correlation with both Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds.
The cornerstone of Payden & Rygel's high-yield strategy is its intensive credit due diligence. With an experienced portfolio manager and a seasoned analyst team, Payden & Rygel successfully navigated the credit market turmoil in both 2007 and 2008. The firm prides itself on its risk controls and risk discipline.
We consider all companies which have bonds above $200 million in issue size. Our investible universe consists of in excess of 620 companies, though 245 of these are between $200-$300 million in issue size. These 245 companies often provide the best value and are "below the radar" of many managers. This allows us to focus on more "undiscovered gems" than the typical high yield manager.

Tax-Exempt Strategies
Tax-exempt bonds (e.g., municipal bonds) should be a significant holding in a fixed-income strategy for taxable investors. Payden & Rygel's tax-sensitive strategies seek to maximize after-tax total return and are customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client as well as clients' tax status and state of domicile.
We believe that superior performance is derived through the inclusion of both taxable and tax-exempt securities in the portfolio opportunity set. The segmented nature of the municipal (tax-exempt) market leads to inefficiencies that can translate into excess returns for those managers with the experience, sophistication and flexibility to capitalize on these opportunities. We believe municipal investing requires elements of both a top-down, as well as bottom-up, investment style. Market surveillance plays a critical role in the municipal market given the significant influence that supply and demand imbalances exert on performance.
Short Term
Short-term Tax Sensitive strategies seek to earn higher income than money market alternatives while preserving capital. Short-maturity municipal bonds as well as Treasury, Agency, corporate and asset-backed bonds may be used.

Intermediate
The Intermediate strategy is a core portfolio strategy. The intermediate maturities along the yield curve provide a large portion of the return of longer securities with a fraction of the price volatility. The portfolios are tailored to meet each client's unique investment goals and tolerance for risk and can be customized to emphasize in-state tax benefits where appropriate.

Long Term
The Long-term strategy is designed for investors who may have long-term liabilities against which they are managing their assets or those with a more income oriented focus. The strategy generally invests in securities across the entire maturity spectrum, and includes sectors such as government securities and mortgage-backed securities in addition to traditional municipal securities.

The value of fixed income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors.  Investment portfolios could lose principal.


Strategic Income
Strategic Income has its roots in core fixed income but expands from there in a more comprehensive and opportunistic fashion.  It is designed as a more "open architecture" approach that is less conforming to traditional fixed income benchmarks.
This approach has gained favor from investors who recognize that there should not be a "one size fits all approach to core style portfolios.  Clients have many different degrees of liquidity needs and beta exposure desires and strategic income in the way we manage it at Payden & Rygel offers this degree of customization.
The strategy allocates to major credit sectors globally in a diversified fashion. Short term and/or high-quality government securities will also be used to ensure liquidity and ease of strategy change, as well as potentially providing a "safe haven" in times of major credit stress. Active rotation among the sectors follows Payden's time-tested macro view through its Investment Policy Committee and coordination with our Core fixed income team. The Payden style of "bonds behaving like bonds should" is not lost in Strategic Income portfolios - our focus is on cash bonds and not derivative strategies that can obfuscate risk and return sources.
Importantly, effective (interest rate) duration may be empirically lower than traditional "core" portfolio durations given the strategic allocations to credit sectors and resulting higher income cushion.

Investment Grade Corporates
Payden & Rygel’s strategy is to purchase investment-grade corporate bonds of companies that have leading market positions, strong cash flow generation, stable management teams and predictable earnings. The strategy’s focus is on bottom-up credit selection with an emphasis placed on adding issues with a near-term catalyst to outperform. Our credit research process looks to capitalise on opportunities in the corporate bond market across sectors and maturities; including the early identification of potential rising stars - companies that we believe will be upgraded to investment grade in the near term. A forward looking approach is taken to credit analysis. A priority is placed on assessing a company’s future trajectory and the corresponding risk and opportunities for bondholders under various scenarios.
The strategy primarily invests in USD investment grade corporate securities with flexibility to opportunistically invest in below investment grade securities.  The strategy may also utilize futures for duration management.

Long-Duration Investing (LDI)
Payden & Rygel’s investment philosophy for Long-Duration Investing (LDI) is that active management of fixed-income investments not only should focus on ways to add value relative to a benchmark, but should also focus on managing risk in its many forms (e.g., credit, liquidity, etc.) consistent with the letter and spirit of our clients’ unique investment guidelines.
Our investment process is a hybrid – we manage a macro-driven top-down approach combined with a bottom-up fundamental view. The process begins with our Investment Policy Committee’s assessment of the global macro-economic environment and formation of our broad-based and long-term view on interest rates (economic growth, inflation, political risk), credit (direction, strength, supply/demand), and risk (primarily focused on downside risk and client portfolio protection). The long duration investment team, based on discussions with the IPC and our sector strategists, will determine sector weightings and then populate these targets with individual issuers to achieve attractive risk-adjusted return expectations.
We maintain diversified portfolios, typically holding 200 bonds, in order to properly manage tracking error and we employ strong risk controls. Our LDI strategy exploits opportunities in the longer end of the maturity curve, ten years and greater, across multiple fixed income. These sectors include U.S. Treasuries, Agencies, global investment-grade corporate bonds, taxable municipal bonds, and investment grade emerging market sovereign and government related bonds. Plain vanilla interest rate swaps and interest rate futures will be used sparingly to manage the duration of the portfolio. Additionally, we invest in sub-investment grade bonds up to 5% to increase income potential and diversify overall credit exposures.

Payden & Rygel's Large-Cap Value / Equity Income strategy takes advantage of the firm's strengths in company and industry analysis, focusing on companies which are projected to maintain or increase their dividend payouts while providing above-market-average dividend yields. Our objective is to provide current income and equity market participation through a well-diversified, high-quality, large-cap portfolio by focusing on companies with steady earnings and cash flow growth.  Our equity team looks beyond the common stock universe for attractive dividend/distribution yields, and researches other areas such as preferred stock, real estate investment trusts, master limited partnerships and business development companies.
The strategy is well-diversified across sectors and equity security types, and generally invests in 50-70 holdings. With the focus on diversification, income and equity market participation, this strategy is appropriate for both investors focusing on income and those looking for a competitive large-cap value offering with lower volatility and attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Stocks in this strategy will generally appreciate less when than the overall market is rising and fall less when the overall market is declining. Investors could lose money during periods of falling stock prices.


The "Absolute Return" investing universe has represented a variety of investment objectives and approaches through time.  Even today the term is used by both hedge funds, on one end of the spectrum, as well as ultra-safe, liquidity type funds, on the other. While the space has yet to be concretely defined, the development of our strategy began with a simple client request to manage a portfolio, untethered from traditional benchmarks, that would produce a reasonable level of return and protect their investment principal. With that objective in mind, the Payden Absolute Return Investing (PARI) approach has been refined over more than 7 years while adhering to the following core objectives:


Produce Positive ReturnsStaying true to the basic definition of "Absolute Return", our strategy aims to produce positive returns with a performance hurdle of LIBOR + 2-3% over a rolling 3-year period.
Protect Downside RiskBefore we consider the direction of markets or the value opportunities that are presented, our first responsibility is to protect an investor's principal against the potential for loss. Risk management is paramount.
Capture "Smart" YieldBenefitting from more than 30 years in fixed income management, the foundation of our strategy is a low duration fixed income portfolio where risk premia from global interest rate curves and credit markets may provide dependable and repeatable returns.

Global Balanced
Payden & Rygel's Global Balanced strategy is designed to help investors meet their financial goals and objectives via a strategic allocation of stocks, bonds and cash.
Country and sector allocations are carefully determined via a top-down approach based on fundamental and quantitative analysis. The correlation between countries is critical to measure appropriate levels of diversification. We utilize futures contracts to implement strategic allocation shifts. High liquidity and low transaction costs are added benefits to Payden & Rygel's proven approach.
Us Balanced
Payden & Rygel's US Balanced portfolio is designed to help clients achieve their financial objectives via a diversified list of U.S. stocks, bonds and cash. The firm can manage mandates for a relative return or absolute return objective.
A portfolio of stocks and bonds is determined using a selection process which considers fundamental economic analysis, valuation measures for stocks and bonds, global asset flows, technical analysis, and overall client goals and objectives. While we utilize extensive quantitative analysis, common sense and good judgment are also key components of our selection process. The strategy generally makes one to four shifts per year, usually changing the allocation mix in five to ten percent increments.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Preperations
Payden & Rygel has developed a Business Continuity Plan to ensure that all critical functions continue in the event of a disruption in normal operations.
The firm has configured data replication servers and related infrastructure in its Boston, Massachusetts office. Data on critical Los Angeles servers is replicated to corresponding servers in the Boston location on a live basis throughout each day. In addition, other servers and databases are backed up, sent electronically to Boston, and restored at the end of each day. The firm has established a dedicated high-speed connection between the Los Angeles and Boston offices to facilitate the secure transmission of data backups.
A number of individuals from the Trading, Portfolio Operations, Information Technology, Compliance and Portfolio Management departments have been selected to connect remotely to the Boston office to complete their daily responsibilities, in the event of a disruption to normal business operations. The firm has implemented a VMWare virtual environment for each of these individuals so that they each have their own remote desktop in Boston to which they securely connect using a laptop or desktop computer with an Internet connection. Our expectation is that routine business operations will resume within 24 hours of a business continuity event. In addition, the Boston office has capacity to accommodate additional employees if a physical relocation of selected Los Angeles employees is necessary.
The firm uses a third-party hosted mass notification system to quickly communicate with all employees in the event of a disruption in operations. The system allows management to compose a text or voice message notifying employees of the event, which is then sent automatically to employees' mobile phones, home phones, and e-mail addresses. Employees indicate their receipt of the message from their phone or mobile device, which allows management to immediately review summary reports of the employees who are aware of the disruption. Additional instructions and updates can then be sent to all staff, as necessary under the circumstances.
In the event that our Business Continuity Plan is activated and Los Angeles office phone lines are down, the Los Angeles phone numbers are re-directed to the Boston office. Boston-based staff will direct callers to the mobile phones of key portfolio professionals, as necessary. All key investment personnel have access to firm e-mail on mobile devices. E-mail delivery to Payden & Rygel addresses is not dependent on the availability of either Los Angeles or Boston servers. Finally, Boston-based staff has access to portfolio management and reporting information independent of Los Angeles technology availability.
The transfer agent for the Paydenfunds is not located in Payden & Rygel's offices. The transfer agent for all of the funds maintains all shareholder records and will continue to receive all shareholder calls related to their accounts.
On at least a quarterly basis, several employees from the departments specified above will remotely connect to the Boston office to test the infrastructure by conducting their daily job responsibilities, including the execution, ticketing, settlement and processing of securities trades.
The Business Continuity Plan was developed and is monitored by a committee of senior managers, including the heads of the Trading, Portfolio Operations, Compliance and Information Technology departments. The committee meets regularly to discuss any necessary updates to the Plan and coordinates ongoing tests of the Boston location by a team of employees from various departments. The committee also solicits feedback from personnel based on the ongoing tests and promptly makes adjustments to the Plan and the Boston office resources, as necessary.
Updates to the Business Continuity Plan will be posted on this website page and a copy of the Plan may also be obtained by written request.
