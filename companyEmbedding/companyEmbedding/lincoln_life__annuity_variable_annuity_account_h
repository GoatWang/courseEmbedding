 Annuities

	Enjoy your retirement





A good retirement income plan should generate two to three decades of sustainable income. It can help protect your assets from inflation, market volatility and savings withdrawal rates.
What is an annuity?
An annuity is an insurance product designed for retirement to help protect your financial future and guard against outliving your savings. An annuity pays you periodic income payments for as long as you live in exchange for a premium and it’s designed to be part of an overall retirement strategy. Annuity types offer different features and payment options to help meet your needs and priorities. Compare your options.
Annuities offer many additional benefits to help you prepare for the future, such as:  

No annual contribution limit
Ability to diversify and potentially grow your investments
Tax-deferred investment income until it’s withdrawn
Death benefit protection for beneficiaries
Optional riders (for an additional cost). Review our rider options.

To decide if a variable annuity is right for you, consider that its value will fluctuate; it’s subject to investment risk and possible loss of principal; and there are costs associated.
If you have questions or for more information on annuities, contact an advisor. 
Tax considerations
Annuities allow money to grow tax-deferred until clients begin taking payments. While consumers can’t control state and federal tax rates or policies they can take steps to help protect savings and income from tax erosion, and improve spending power in retirement.

What type is right for me?



The two main types of annuities are fixed and variable. While both options provide guaranteed income in retirement, they each offer different features and benefits.
Fixed annuities
With a fixed annuity, premiums go toward predictable returns, growth potential and the possibility of a lifetime income stream. 
We offer three types of fixed annuities:

Fixed annuities offer a predictable return. 
Fixed indexed annuities offer growth potential and a living benefit.
Income annuities provide current and future income.

Variable annuities
A variable annuity is a flexible income solution designed for retirement that provides a guaranteed lifetime income stream. Consumers can also capture growth potential over time through the performance of underlying investment options.
To decide if a variable annuity is right for you, consider that its value will fluctuate; it’s subject to investment risk and possible loss of principal; and there are costs associated. All guarantees, including those for optional features, are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuer. Limitations and conditions apply.

Investors are advised to consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options carefully before investing. The applicable variable annuity prospectuses contains this and other important information about the variable annuity and its underlying investment options. Please call 888-868-2583 for a free prospectus. Read it carefully before investing or sending money. Products and features are subject to state availability.
 
A fixed annuity is intended for retirement or other long-term needs. It is intended for a person who has sufficient cash or other liquid assets for living expenses and other unexpected emergencies, such as medical expenses. A fixed indexed annuity is not a registered security or stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investments, or index. The index used is a price index and does not reflect dividends paid on the underlying stocks.

 Lincoln Life & Annuity Variable Annuity Account H
 American Legacy III

Supplement dated September 1, 2005
 to the Prospectus dated May 1, 2005

Please keep this Supplement with your current American Legacy III Prospectus and
retain it for reference. This Supplement replaces the discussion currently in   
your prospectus regarding the death benefits available under i4LIFE(R)          
Advantage. No action is required on your part unless you wish to elect the      
i4LIFE(R) Advantage.                                                            

Effective on or about September 1, 2005 (depending on state availability), the  
i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit will be available to   
owners of both qualified (IRA and Roth IRA) and non-qualified contracts who     
elect i4LIFE(R) Advantage. The i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death 
benefit option is not available to existing contractowners if the Account Value 
death benefit was in force prior to electing i4LIFE(R) Advantage. The i4LIFE(R) 
Advantage Enhanced Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (EGMDB) is available to     
existing contractowners only if the EGMDB (or more expensive death benefit '    
option) was in force prior to electing i4LIFE(R) Advantage.                     

Once i4LIFE(R) Advantage begins, any prior death benefit election will          
terminate. The death benefit proceeds under the new death benefit may be less   
than the amount that would have been paid under the death benefit in effect     
before i4LIFE(R) Advantage began. The death benefit options described in this   
supplement are only available during the Access Period.                         

Effective Date                                                                  

If the benefit is elected after the contract is issued (by sending a            
written request to our home office), the benefit will be effective on the next  
valuation date following approval by us.                                        

Charges                                                                         

If you elect i4LIFE(R) Advantage, your Separate Account Annual Expenses (as a   
percentage of average daily net assets in the subaccounts) will be:

For a complete listing of charges, see Expense tables in the prospectus.        

i4LIFE(R) Advantage Account Value death benefit. The i4LIFE(R)Advantage Account 
Value death benefit is available for both qualified and non-qualified annuity   
contracts. This benefit is equal to the Account Value as of the valuation date  
on which we approve the payment of the death claim. The charge under this death 
benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.65% (or 2.15% if the Guaranteed Income  
Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the Account Value in the VAA. You 
may not change this death benefit once it is elected.                           

i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit. The i4LIFE(R)         
Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit is available for both qualified  
and non-qualified contracts. This benefit will be equal to the greater of:      

o the Account Value as of the valuation date we approve the payment of the      
claim; or                                                                   
o the sum of all purchase payments, minus all death benefit reductions          
where:                                                                      
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for a regular
          income payment will be for the dollar amount of the regular income
payment; and                                            
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for all other
            withdrawals will be deducted in the same proportion that withdrawals
reduce the contract or Account value.                   

In a declining market, withdrawals deducted in the same proportion that         
withdrawals reduce the contract or Account Value may have a magnified effect on 
the reduction of the death benefit payable. All references to withdrawals       
include deductions for applicable charges and premium taxes, if any.            

The charge under this death benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.70% (or     
2.20% if the Guaranteed Income Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the
Account Value in the VAA.                                                       

During the Access Period, contracts with the i4LIFE(R)Advantage Guarantee of    
Principal death benefit may elect to change to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Account  
Value death benefit. We will effect the change in death benefit on the valuation
date we receive a completed election form at our Home office, and we will begin 
deducting the lower i4LIFE(R) Advantage charge at that time. Once the change is 
effective, you may not elect to return to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of  
Principal death benefit.                                                        

i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB. If you own a non-qualified annuity contract, you may 
also elect the i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB. (This benefit is not available with   
qualified contracts.) The benefit is the greatest of:                           
o        the Account Value as of the valuation date on which we approve the     
payment of the claim; or                                      
o        the sum of all purchase payments, minus all death benefit reductions   
where                                                   
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for a regular
          income payment will be for the dollar amount of the regular income
payment; and                                            
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for all other
withdrawals will be deducted in the same proportion that
withdrawals reduce the contract or Account value; or    
o        the highest Account Value or contract value which the contract attains 
 on any contract anniversary date (including the inception date)
    (determined before the allocation of any purchase payments on that
       contract anniversary) prior to the 81st birthday of the deceased. The
  highest Account Value or contract value is increased by purchase
      payments and is decreased by regular income payments and withdrawals
       subsequent to the anniversary date on which the highest Account Value
        or contract value is obtained. Regular income payments and withdrawals
      are deducted in the same proportion that regular income payments and
withdrawals reduce the Account Value.                         

In a declining market, withdrawals deducted in the same proportion that         
withdrawals reduce the Account Value may have a magnified effect on the         
reduction of the death benefit payable. All references to withdrawals include   
deductions for applicable charges and premium taxes, if any.                    

Upon the death of any contractowner or joint owner who was not a contractowner  
on the effective date of the i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB death benefit, the death 
benefit will be equal to the Account Value as of the date we approve the death  
claim for payment (unless the change occurred because of the death of a         
contractowner or joint owner). If any contractowner or joint owner is changed   
due to a death and the new contractowner or joint owner is age 81 or older when 
added to the contract, then the death benefit for this new contractowner or     
joint owner will be equal to the Account Value as of the date we approve the    
death claim subsequent to the new contractowner's death.                        

The charge under this death benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.95% (or     
2.45% if the Guaranteed Income Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the
Account Value in the VAA.                                                       

During the Access Period, contracts with the i4LIFE(R)Advantage EGMDB may elect 
to change to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit or    
Account Value death benefit. We will effect the change in death benefit on the  
valuation date we receive a completed election form at our Home office, and we  
will begin deducting the lower i4LIFE(R) Advantage charge at that time. Once the
change is effective, you may not elect to return to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage     
EGMDB.                                                                          

General Provisions                                                              

For non-qualified contracts, upon the death of the contractowner, joint owner or
annuitant, the contractowner (or beneficiary) may elect to terminate the        
contract and receive full payment of the death benefit or may elect to continue 
the contract and receive regular income payments. Upon the death of the         
secondary life, no death benefit is paid.                                       

If you are the owner of an IRA annuity contract, and you die during the Access  
Period, the i4LIFE(R) Advantage will terminate. A spouse beneficiary may start a
new i4LIFE(R) Advantage program.                                                

The value of the death benefit will be determined as of the valuation date we   
approve the payment of the claim. Approval of payment will occur upon our       
receipt of all the following:                                                   

     1. proof (e.g. an original certified death certificate), or any other
proof of death satisfactory to us; and                    
2. written authorization for payment; and                       
      3. all required claim forms, fully completed (including selection of a
settlement option).                                       

Notwithstanding any provision of this contract to the contrary, the             
payment of death benefits provided under this contract must be made in          
compliance with Code Section 74(s) or 401(a)(9) as applicable, as amended from  
time to time. Death benefits may be taxable. See Federal tax matters in the     
prospectus.                                                                     

If the contract is continued, upon notification to Lincoln Life of the death,   
regular income payments may be suspended until the death claim is approved. Upon
approval, a lump sum payment for the value of any suspended payments will be    
made as of the date the death claim is approved, and regular income payments    
will continue. The excess, if any, of the death benefit over the Account Value  
will be credited into the contract at that time.                                

If a lump sum settlement is elected, the proceeds will be mailed within seven   
days of approval by us of the claim subject to the laws, regulations and tax    
code governing payment of death benefits. This payment may be postponed as      
permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                

For both qualified and non-qualified contracts, following the Access Period,    
there is no death benefit.

Supplement to the Prospectus Dated May 1, 2005

This supplement describes two new features that are applicable to your variable 
annuity. No action is required on your part. Please refer to your product       
prospectus if you need further information on additional features of your       
annuity.                                                                        

The contracts - Surrenders and withdrawals. Beginning October 15, 2005, all     
surrender requests must be submitted on the Lincoln Life Surrender Form         
available from the Home Office. This form can be obtained by calling the        
toll-free customer service number listed in your prospectus, or by logging into 
your account at www.lfg.com.                                                    

The contracts - SecureLine(R) Account                                           

The SecureLine(R) account is a special service that we offer in which your death
benefit or surrender proceeds are placed into an interest-bearing account.      
Instead of mailing you (or the recipient of the death proceeds) a check, we will
send a checkbook so that you (or the death proceeds recipient) will have access 
to the account simply by writing a check for all or any part of the proceeds.   
The SecureLine(R) account is part of our general account. It is not a bank      
account and it is not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency. As    
part of our general account, it is subject to the claims of our creditors. We   
receive a benefit from all amounts left in the SecureLine(R) account.           

If you request a lump sum surrender and your surrender value is over $10,000,   
your money will be placed into the account in your name. You are the owner of   
the account, and are the only one authorized to transfer proceeds from the      
account. You may choose to leave the proceeds in this account, or you may begin 
writing checks immediately.                                                     

In the case of a death of one of the parties to the annuity contract, if the    
recipient of the death benefit has elected a lump sum settlement and the        
contract value is over $10,000, the proceeds will be placed into the            
interest-bearing account in the recipient's name as the owner of the account.   
The SecureLine(R) account allows the recipient additional time to decide how    
to manage death benefit proceeds with the balance earning interest from the day 
the account is opened.

Item 28. Indemnification                                                        

(a) Brief description of indemnification provisions.                  

  In general, Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company
   of New York provides that Lincoln New York will indemnify certain persons
   against expenses, judgments and certain other specified costs incurred by
 any such person if he/she is made a party or is threatened to be made a
  party to a suit or proceeding because he/she was a director, officer, or
    employee of Lincoln New York, as long as he/she acted in good faith and in
    a manner he/she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of, or act
opposed to the best interests of, Lincoln New York. Certain additional
conditions apply to indemnification in criminal proceedings.          

 In particular, separate conditions govern indemnification of directors,
  officers, and employees of Lincoln New York in connection with suits by,
or in the right of, Lincoln New York.                                 

 Please refer to Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln New York (Exhibit
no. 6 hereto) for the full text of the indemnification provisions.    
 Indemnification is permitted by, and is subject to the requirements of,
New York law.                                                         

   (b) Undertaking pursuant to Rule 484 of Regulation C under the Securities
Act of 1933:                                                        

 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling   
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item
28(a) above or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the 
   opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,      
   unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
    liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
    or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in
    the successful defense of any such action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
    securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of
  its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit
to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such      
    indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

This Prospectus describes the individual flexible premium deferred variable     
annuity contract that is issued by Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York   
("LNY"). It is primarily for use with nonqualified plans and qualified          
retirement plans under Sections 408 (IRAs) and 408A (Roth IRAs) of the tax      
code. Generally, you do not pay federal income tax on the contract's growth     
until it is paid out. The contract is designed to accumulate contract value and 
to provide retirement income that you cannot outlive or for an agreed upon      
time. These benefits may be a variable or fixed amount or a combination of      
both. If you die before the annuity commencement date, we will pay your         
beneficiary a death benefit. In the alternative, you may choose to receive a    
death benefit on the death of the annuitant.                                    

The minimum initial purchase payment for the contract is $25,000.               

Additional purchase payments may be made to the contract and must be at least   
$100 per payment ($25 if transmitted electronically), and at least $300         
annually.                                                                       

You choose whether your contract value accumulates on a variable or a fixed     
(guaranteed) basis or both. If you put all your purchase payments into the      
fixed account, we guarantee your principal and a minimum interest rate. We      
limit withdrawals and transfers from the fixed side of the contract.            

LNY offers variable annuity contracts that do not have persistency credits and  
have lower fees. You should carefully consider whether or not this contract is  
the best product for you.                                                       

All purchase payments for benefits on a variable basis will be placed in        
Lincoln Life & Annuity Variable Annuity Account H (variable annuity account     
[VAA]). The VAA is a segregated investment account of LNY. If you put all or    
some of your purchase payments into one or more of the contract's variable      
options you take all the investment risk on the contract value and the          
retirement income. If the subaccounts you select make money, your contract      
value goes up; if they lose money, it goes down. How much it goes up or down    
depends on the performance of the subaccounts you select. We do not guarantee   
how any of the variable options or their funds will perform. Also, neither the  
U.S. Government nor any federal agency insures or guarantees your investment in 
the contract.

Summary of contractowner expenses:                                              

The maximum surrender charge (contingent deferred sales charge) (as a           
percentage of purchase payments surrendered/withdrawn): 6%                      

The surrender charge percentage is reduced over time. The later the redemption  
occurs, the lower the surrender charge with respect to that surrender or        
withdrawal. We may waive this charge in certain situations. See Surrender       
charges.                                                                        

Transfer charge: $25                                                            

The transfer charge will not be imposed on the first 12 transfers during a      
contract year. In the future, we reserve the right to charge a $25 fee for the  
13th and each additional transfer during any contract year. Automatic dollar    
cost averaging and automatic rebalancing transfers are not included in these    
first twelve transfers.

The Expense Tables reflect expenses of the VAA as well as expenses of the       
funds. We provide these examples to help you understand the direct and indirect 
costs and expenses of the contract. The examples assume that the EGMDB is in    
effect. Without this benefit, expenses would be lower.                          

For more information, see Charges and other deductions in this Prospectus, and  
Management and Organization in the Prospectus for the series. Premium taxes may 
also apply, although they do not appear in the examples. Different fees and     
expenses not reflected in the examples may be imposed during a period in which  
annuity payouts are made. We also reserve the right to impose a charge on       
transfers between subaccounts and to and from the fixed account--currently,     
there is no charge. These examples should not be considered a representation of 
past or future expenses. Actual expenses may be more or less than those shown.

Summary                                                                         

What kind of contract am I buying? It is an individual annuity contract between 
you and LNY. It may provide for a fixed annuity and/or a variable annuity. This 
Prospectus describes the variable side of the contract. See The contracts.      

What is the variable annuity account (VAA)? It is a separate account we         
established under New York insurance law, and registered with the SEC as a unit 
investment trust. VAA assets are allocated to one or more subaccounts,          
according to your investment choices. VAA assets are not chargeable with        
liabilities arising out of any other business which LNY may conduct. See        
Variable annuity account.                                                       

What are my investment choices? Based upon your instruction, the VAA applies    
your purchase payments to buy series shares in one or more of the investment    
funds of the series: Global Discovery, Global Growth, Global Small              
Capitalization, Growth, International, New World, Growth-Income, Blue Chip      
Income and Growth, Asset Allocation, Bond, High-Income Bond, U.S.               
Government/AAA-Rated Securities and Cash Management. In turn, each fund holds a 
portfolio of securities consistent with its investment policy. See Investments  
of the variable annuity account--Description of the series.                     

Who invests my money? The investment adviser for the series is Capital Research 
and Management Company (CRMC), Los Angeles, California. CRMC is registered as   
an investment adviser with the SEC. See Investments of the variable annuity     
account--Investment adviser.                                                    

How does the contract work? If we approve your application, we will send you a  
contract. When you make purchase payments during the accumulation phase, you    
buy accumulation units. If you decide to receive an annuity payout, your        
accumulation units are converted to annuity units. Your annuity payouts will be 
based on the number of annuity units you received and the value of each annuity 
unit on payout days. See The contracts.                                         

What charges do I pay under the contract? If you withdraw contract value, you   
pay a surrender charge from 0% to 6%, depending upon how many contract years    
those payments have been in the contract. We may waive surrender charges in     
certain situations. See Charges and other deductions--Surrender charge.         

We will deduct any applicable premium tax from purchase payments or contract    
value at the time the tax is incurred or at another time we choose.             

We apply an annual charge totaling 1.70% to the daily net asset value of the    
VAA. This charge includes 0.10% as an administrative charge and 1.60% as a      
mortality and expense risk charge. If the Guarantee of Principal death benefit  
is in effect, the mortality and expense risk charge is 1.50%, for an annual     
charge totaling 1.60%. See Charges and other deductions.                        

Currently, there is no charge for a transfer. However, we reserve the right to  
charge in the future a $25 fee for transfers after the first 12 within a        
contract year.                                                                  

The series pays a management fee to CRMC based on the average daily net asset   
value of each fund. See Investments of the variable annuity account--Investment 
adviser. Each fund also has a 12b-1 fee and additional operating expenses.      
These are described in the prospectus for the series.                           

Charges may also be imposed during the annuity payout period. See The contracts 
and Annuity payouts.

The contracts--Commissions.                                                     

What purchase payments do I make, and how often? Subject to the minimum and     
maximum payment amounts, your payments are completely flexible. See The         
contracts--Purchase payments.                                                   

What is a persistency credit? A persistency credit of .075% of contract value   
less purchase payments that have been in the contract less than seven years     
will be credited on a quarterly basis after the seventh anniversary. See The    
contracts--Persistency credits.                                                 

How will my annuity payouts be calculated? If you decide to annuitize, you may  
select an annuity option and start receiving annuity payouts from your contract 
as a fixed option or variable option or a combination of both. See Annuity      
options. Remember that participants in the VAA benefit from any gain, and take  
a risk of any loss, in the value of the securities in the funds' portfolios.    

What happens if I die before I annuitize? Your beneficiary will receive the     
death benefit proceeds based upon the death benefit option you select. Your     
beneficiary has options as to how the death benefit is paid. In the             
alternative, you may choose to receive a death benefit upon the death of the    
annuitant. See The contract--Death benefit before the annuity commencement date.

May I transfer contract value between variable options and between the fixed    
side of the contract? Yes, with certain limits. See The contracts--Transfers    
between subaccounts on or before the annuity commencement date and Transfers    
following the annuity commencement date, Transfers to and from the general      
account on or before the annuity commencement date.                             

May I surrender the contract or make a withdraw-al? Yes, subject to contract    
requirements and to the restrictions of any qualified retirement plan for which 
the contract was purchased. See The contracts--Surrenders and withdrawals. If   
you surrender the contract or make a withdrawal, certain charges may apply. See 
Charges and other deductions. A portion of surrender/withdrawal proceeds may be 
taxable. In addition, if you decide to take a distribution before age 59 1/2, a 
10% Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax penalty may apply. A surrender or a      
withdrawal also may be subject to 20% withholding. See Federal tax matters.     

Do I get a free look at this contract? Yes. You can cancel the contract within  
ten days of the date you first receive the contract. You need to return the     
contract, postage prepaid, to our servicing office. You assume the risk of any  
market drop on purchase payments you allocate to the variable side of the       
contract. See Return privilege.

Since the contract was not available as of December 31, 2001, accumulation unit 
values are not included in this Prospectus or in the SAI.                       

Investment results                                                              

At times, the VAA may compare its investment results to various unmanaged       
indices or other variable annuities in reports to shareholders, sales           
literature and advertisements. The results will be calculated on a total return 
basis for various periods, with or without contingent deferred sales charges.   
Results calculated without contingent deferred sales charges will be higher.    
Total returns include the reinvestment of all distributions, which are          
reflected in changes in unit value.                                             

During extended periods of low interest rates, the yields of any subaccount     
investing in a money market fund may also become extremely low and possibly     
negative. The annual performance of the subaccounts is based on past            
performance and does not indicate or represent future performance. See the SAI

Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York                                      

LNY is a life insurance company founded in New York on June 6, 1996. LNY is a   
subsidiary of Lincoln Life. Lincoln Life is one of the largest stock life       
insurance companies in the United States. Lincoln Life, an Indiana Corporation, 
is owned by Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) which is also organized under Indiana  
law. LNC's primary businesses are insurance and financial services.             

Fixed side of the contract                                                      

Purchase payments allocated to the fixed side of the contract become part of    
LNY's general account, and do not participate in the investment experience of   
the VAA. The general account is subject to regulation and supervision by the    
New York Insurance Department. In reliance on certain exemptions, exclusions    
and rules, LNY has not registered interests in the general account as a         
security under the Securities Act of 1933 and has not registered the general    
account as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.      
Accordingly, neither the general account nor any interests in it are regulated  
under the 1933 Act or the 1940 Act. LNY has been advised that the staff of the  
SEC has not made a review of the disclosures which are included in this         
Prospectus which relate to our general account and to the fixed account under   
the contract. These disclosures, however, may be subject to certain provisions  
of the federal securities laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of     
statements made in prospectuses. This Prospectus is generally intended to serve 
as a disclosure document only for aspects of the contract involving the VAA,    
and therefore contains only selected information regarding the fixed side of    
the contract. Complete details regarding the fixed side of the contract are in  
the contract.                                                                   

Purchase payments allocated to the fixed side of the contract are guaranteed to 
be credited with a minimum interest rate, specified in the contract, of at      
least 3.0%. A purchase payment allocated to the fixed side of the contract is   
credited with interest beginning on the next calendar day following the date of 
receipt if all data is complete. LNY may vary the way in which it credits       
interest to the fixed side of the contract from time to time.                   

ANY INTEREST IN EXCESS OF 3.0% WILL BE DECLARED IN ADVANCE IN LNY'S SOLE        
DISCRETION. CONTRACTOWNERS BEAR THE RISK THAT NO INTEREST IN EXCESS OF 3.0%     
WILL BE DECLARED.                                                               

Variable annuity account (VAA)                                                  

On July 24, 1996, the VAA was established as an insurance company separate      
account under New York law. It is registered with the SEC as a unit investment  
trust under the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act).    
The SEC does not supervise the VAA or LNY. The VAA is a segregated investment   
account, meaning that its assets may not be charged with liabilities resulting  
from any other business that we may conduct. Income, gains and losses, whether  
realized or not, from assets allocated to the VAA are, in accordance with the   
applicable annuity contracts, credited to or charged against the VAA. They are  
credited or charged without regard to any other income, gains or losses of LNY. 

LNY is the issuer of the contracts, and the obligations set forth in the        
contract, other than those of the contractowner, are LNY's.                     

The VAA satisfies the definition of a separate account under the federal        
securities laws. We do not guarantee the investment performance of the VAA. Any 
investment gain or loss depends on the investment performance of the funds. You 
assume the full investment risk for all amounts placed in the VAA.              

The VAA is used to support other annuity contracts offered by LNY in addition   
to the contracts described in this Prospectus.                                  

6                                                                               

P-->N-4/A8th�Page�of�87TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
The other annuity contracts supported by the VAA invest in the same portfolios  
of the series as the contracts described in this Prospectus. These other        
annuity contracts may have different charges that could affect the performance  
of their subaccounts and they offer different benefits.                         

Investments of the variable annuity account                                     

You decide the subaccount(s) to which you allocate purchase payments. There is  
a separate subaccount which corresponds to each class of each fund of the       
series. You may change your allocation without penalty or charges.              
Shares of the funds will be sold at net asset value with no initial sales       
charge to the VAA in order to fund the contracts. The series is required to     
redeem fund shares at net asset value upon our request. We reserve the right to 
add, delete or substitute funds.                                                

Investment adviser                                                              

The investment adviser for the series is Capital Research and Management        
Company (CRMC), 333 South Hope Street, Los Angeles, California 90071. CRMC is   
one of the nation's largest and oldest investment management organizations. As  
compensation for its services to the series, the investment adviser receives a  
fee from the series which is accrued daily and paid monthly. This fee is based  
on the net assets of each fund, as defined under Purchases and Redemptions of   
Shares, in the prospectus for the series.                                       

With respect to the series, the adviser and/or distributor, or an affiliate     
thereof, may compensate LNY (or an affiliate) for administrative, distribution, 
or other services. It is anticipated that such compensation will be based on    
assets of the particular series attributable to the contracts along with        
certain other variable contracts issued or administered by LNY (or an           
affiliate).                                                                     

Description of the series                                                       
The series was organized as a Massachusetts business trust in 1983 and is       
registered as a diversified, open-end management investment company under the   
1940 Act. Diversified means not owning too great a percentage of the securities 
of any one company. An open-end company is one which, in this case, permits LNY 
to sell its shares back to the series when you make a withdrawal, surrender the 
contract or transfer from one fund to another. Management investment company is 
the legal term for a mutual fund. These definitions are very general. The       
precise legal definitions for these terms are contained in the 1940 Act.        

The series has thirteen separate portfolios of funds. Fund assets are           
segregated and a shareholder's interest is limited to those funds in which the  
shareholder owns shares. The series has adopted a plan pursuant to Rule 18f-3   
under the 1940 Act to permit the series to establish a multiple class           
distribution system for all of its portfolios. The series' Board of Trustees    
may at any time establish additional funds or classes, which may or may not be  
available to the VAA.                                                           

Under the multi-class system adopted by the series, shares of each multi-class  
fund represent an equal pro rata interest in that fund and, generally, have     
identical voting, dividend, liquidation, and other rights, preferences, powers, 
restrictions, limitations, qualifications and terms and conditions, except      
that: (1) each class has a different designation; (2) each class of shares      
bears its class expenses; (3) each class has exclusive voting rights on any     
matter submitted to shareholders that relates solely to its distribution        
arrangement; and (4) each class has separate voting rights on any matter        
submitted to shareholders in which the interests of one class differ from the   
interests of any other class. Expenses currently designated as class expenses   
by the series' Board of Trustees under the plan pursuant to Rule 18f-3 include, 
for example, service fees paid under a 12b-1 plan to cover servicing fees paid  
to dealers selling the contracts as well as related expenses incurred by LNY.   

Each fund has two classes of shares, designated as Class 1 shares and Class 2   
shares. Class 1 and 2 differ primarily in that Class 2 (but not Class 1) shares 
are subject to a 12b-1 plan. Only Class 2 shares are available under the        
contracts.                                                                      

Certain funds offered as part of this contract have similar investment          
objectives and policies to other portfolios managed by the adviser. The         
investment results of the funds, however, may be higher or lower than the other 
portfolios that are managed by the adviser. There can be no assurance, and no   
representation is made, that the investment results of any of the funds will be 
comparable to the investment results of any other portfolio managed by the      
adviser.                                                                        

Following are brief summaries of the investment objectives and policies of the  
funds. Each fund may be subject to certain investment policies and restrictions 
which may not be changed without a majority vote of shareholders of that fund.  
More detailed information may be obtained from the current prospectus for the   
series which is included in this booklet. You should read the series'           
prospectus carefully before investing. Please be advised that there is no       
assurance that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives.

We will purchase shares of the funds at net asset value and direct them to the  
appropriate subaccounts of the VAA. We will redeem sufficient shares of the     
appropriate funds to pay annuity payouts, death benefits, surrender/withdrawal  
proceeds or for other purposes described in the contract. If you want to        
transfer all or part of your investment from one subaccount to another, we may  
redeem shares held in the first and purchase shares of the other. Redeemed      
shares are retired, but they may be reissued later.                             

Shares of the funds are not sold directly to the general public. They are sold  
to LNY, and may be sold to other insurance companies, for investment of the     
assets of the subaccounts established by those insurance companies to fund      
variable annuity and variable life insurance                                    
contracts.                                                                      

When the series sells shares in any of its funds both to variable annuity and   
to variable life insurance separate accounts, it is said to engage in mixed     
funding. When the series sells shares in any of its funds to separate accounts  
of unaffiliated life insurance companies, it is said to engage in shared        
funding.

The series currently engages in mixed and shared funding. Therefore, due to     
differences in redemption rates or tax treatment, or other considerations, the  
interests of various contractowners participating in a fund could conflict. The 
series' Board of Trustees will monitor for the existence of any material        
conflicts, and determine what action, if any, should be taken. See the          
prospectus for the series.                                                      

Reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions                        
All dividend and capital gain distributions of the funds are automatically      
reinvested in shares of the distributing funds at their net asset value on the  
date of distribution. Dividends are not paid out to contractowners as           
additional units, but are reflected as changes in unit values.                  

Addition, deletion or substitution of investments                               
We reserve the right, within the law, to make additions, deletions and          
substitutions for the series and/or any funds within the series in which the    
VAA participates. We may also add, delete, or substitute series or funds only   
for certain classes of contractowners. New or substitute funds may have         
different fees and expenses, and may only be offered to certain classes of      
contractowners.                                                                 

Substitutions may be made with respect to existing investments or the           
investments of future purchase payments, or both. We may close subaccounts to   
allocations of purchase payments or contract value, or both, at any time in our 
sole discretion. The funds, which sell their shares to the subaccounts pursuant 
to participation agreements, also may terminate these agreements and            
discontinue offering their shares to the subaccounts.                           

Substitutions might also occur if shares of a fund should no longer be          
available, or if investment in any fund's shares should become inappropriate,   
in the judgment of our management, for the purposes of the contract, or for any 
other reason in our sole discretion. We will not substitute shares of one fund  
for another without any necessary approval by the SEC. We will also provide you 
advance written notice.                                                         

Charges and other                                                               
deductions                                                                      

We will deduct the charges described below to cover our costs and expenses,     
services provided and risks assumed under the contracts. We incur certain costs 
and expenses for the distribution and administration of the contracts and for   
providing the benefits payable thereunder. More particularly, our               
administrative services include: processing applications for and issuing the    
contracts, processing purchases and redemptions of fund shares as required      
(including dollar cost averaging, cross-reinvestment, portfolio rebalancing and 
automatic withdrawal services--See Additional services and the SAI for more     
information about these programs), main taining records, administering annuity  
payouts, furnishing accounting and valuation services (including the            
calculation and monitoring of daily subaccount values), reconciling and         
depositing cash receipts, providing contract confirmations, providing toll-free 
inquiry services and furnishing telephone and electronic fund transfer          
services. The risks we assume include: the risk that annuitants receiving       
annuity payouts under contract live longer than we assumed when we calculated   
our guaranteed rates (these rates are incorporated in the contract and cannot   
be changed); the risk that death benefits paid under the EGMDB, will exceed the 
actual contract value; the risk that more owners than expected will qualify for 
waivers of the contingent deferred sales charge; and the risk that our costs in 
providing the services will exceed our revenues from contract charges (which we 
cannot change). The amount of a charge may not necessarily correspond to the    
costs associated with providing the services or benefits indicated by the       
description of the charge. For example, the contingent deferred sales load      
collected may not fully cover all of the sales and distribution expenses        
actually incurred by us. Any remaining expenses will be paid from our general   
account which may consist, among other things, of proceeds derived from         
mortality and expense risk charges deducted from the account. We may profit     
from one or more of the fees and charges deducted under the contract. We may    
use these profits for any corporate purpose, including financing the            
distribution of the contracts.                                                  

Deductions from the VAA                                                         

For contracts with the EGMDB, we deduct from the VAA an amount, computed daily, 
which is equal to an annual rate of 1.70% (1.60% for contracts with the         
Guarantee of Principal death benefit) of the daily net asset value. The charge  
consists of a 0.10% administrative charge and a 1.60% (1.50% for contracts with 
the Guarantee of Principal death benefit) mortality and expense risk charge.    

Surrender charge                                                                
A surrender charge applies (except as described below) to surrenders and        
withdrawals of other purchase payments that have been invested for the periods  
indicated as follows:

A surrender charge does not apply to:                                           

1.A surrender or withdrawal of purchase payments that have been invested at   
least four full contract years.                                           

                                                                           9

2.Withdrawals of contract value during a contract year to the extent that the 
total contract value withdrawn during the current contract year does not  
 exceed the free amount, which is equal to the greater of 10% of the current
contract value or 10% of the total purchase payments.                     

3.Automatic withdrawals in total not in excess of the greater of 10% of of the
 contract value or 10% of the purchase payments during a contract year, made
by non-trustee contractowners who are at least 59 1/2.                    

4.A surrender or withdrawal of any purchase payments after the onset of a     
permanent and total disability of the contractowner, which disability     
occurred and has existed continuously for a period of twelve months before
the 65th birthday of the contractowner.                                   

5.A surrender or withdrawal of any purchase payments as a result of admittance
  of the contractowner to an accredited nursing home or equivalent health care
facility, where the admittance into the nursing home occurs after the     
 effective date of the contract and the owner has been confined for at least
90 consecutive days.                                                      

6.A surrender or withdrawal of any purchase payments as a result of the       
diagnosis of a terminal illness that is after the effective date of the   
contract and results in a life expectancy of less than one year as        
determined by a qualified professional medical practitioner.              

7.When the surviving spouse assumes ownership of the contract as a result of  
the death of the original owner.                                          

8.A surrender of the contract as a result of the death of the contractowner,  
  joint owner, if applicable or annuitant. However, if an annuitant is changed
for any reason other than death of a prior annuitant, the surrender charge
 is not waived. See The Contracts--Death benefit before annuity commencement
date.                                                                     

9.Contract value applied to calculate the benefit amount under any annuity    
payout option made available by LNY.                                      

10.Periodic payments made under any annuity payout option made available by LNY.

For purposes of calculating the surrender charge on withdrawals on contracts    
where the contractowner is not a Charitable Remainder Trust, LNY assumes that:  

a.The free amount will be withdrawn from purchase payments on a "first in-first 
out (FIFO)" basis.                                                          

b.Prior to the fourth anniversary of the contract, any amount withdrawn above   
the free amount during a contract year will be withdrawn in the following   
order:                                                                      

1.from purchase payments (on a FIFO basis) until exhausted; then            

2.from earnings.                                                            

c.On or after the fourth anniversary of the contract, any amount withdrawn      
above the free amount during a contract year will be withdrawn in the       
following order:                                                            

1.from purchase payments (on a FIFO basis) to which a surrender charge no   
longer applies until exhausted; then                                    

2.from earnings and persistency credits until exhausted; then               

3.from purchase payments (on a FIFO basis) to which a surrender charge still
applies.                                                                

For purposes of calculating the surrender charge on withdrawals on contracts    
where the contractowner is a Charitable Remainder Trust, LNY assumes that:      

a.The free amount will be withdrawn from purchase payments on a "first in-first 
out (FIFO)" basis.                                                          

b.Any amount withdrawn above the free amount during a contract year will be     
withdrawn in the following order:                                           

1.from purchase payments (on a FIFO basis) to which a surrender charge no   
longer applies until exhausted; then                                    

2.from earnings and persistency credits until exhausted; then               

3.from purchase payments (on a FIFO basis) to which a surrender charge still
applies.                                                                

We apply the surrender charge as a percentage of purchase payments, which means 
that you would pay the same surrender charge at the time of surrender           
regardless of whether your contract value has increased or decreased. The       
surrender charge is calculated separately for each contract year's purchase     
payments to which a charge applies. The surrender charges associated with       
surrender or withdrawal are paid to us to compensate us for the loss we         
experience on contract distribution costs when contractowners surrender or      
withdraw before distribution costs have been recovered.                         

If the contractowner is a corporation or other non-individual (non-natural      
person), the annuitant or joint annuitant will be considered the contractowner  
or joint owner for purposes of determining when a surrender charge does not     
apply.                                                                          

Transfer fee                                                                    

We reserve the right to impose in the future a $25 fee for transfers over 12    
times during any contract year. Automatic dollar cost averaging and automatic   
rebalancing transfers are not included in the limit of twelve transfers.        

10

Rider charges                                                                   
A fee or expense may also be deducted in connection with any benefits added to  
the contract by rider or endorsement. See the rider for any applicable fee or   
expense.                                                                        

Deductions for premium taxes                                                    
Any premium tax or other tax levied by any govern-mental entity as a result of  
the existence of the contracts or the VAA will be deducted from the contract    
value when incurred, or at another time of our choosing.                        

The applicable premium tax rates that states and other governmental entities    
impose on the purchase of an annuity are subject to change by legislation, by   
administrative interpretation or by judicial action. These premium taxes        
generally depend upon the law of your state of residence. The tax ranges from   
zero to 3.5%. Currently there is no premium tax levied for New York residents.  

Other charges and deductions                                                    

Charges may also be imposed during the annuity payout period. See Annuity       
payouts.                                                                        

There are additional deductions from and expenses paid out of the assets of the 
underlying series that are more fully described in the prospectus for the       
series. Among these deductions and expenses are 12b-1 fees which reimburse LNY  
for certain expenses incurred in connection with certain administrative and     
distribution support services provided to the series.                           

Additional information                                                          
The administrative and surrender charges described previously may be reduced or 
eliminated for any particular contract. However, these charges will be reduced  
only to the extent that we anticipate lower distribution and/or administrative  
expenses, or that we perform fewer sales or administrative services than those  
originally contemplated in establishing the level of those charges. Lower       
distribution and administrative expenses may be the result of economies         
associated with (1) the use of mass enrollment procedures, (2) the performance  
of administrative or sales functions by the employer, (3) the use by an         
employer of automated techniques in submitting deposits or information related  
to deposits on behalf of its employees or (4) any other circumstances which     
reduce distribution or administrative expenses. The exact amount of             
administrative and surrender charges applicable to a particular contract will   
be stated in that contract.                                                     

The contract                                                                    

Purchase of contract                                                            
The contract is available in New York. If you wish to purchase a contract, you  
must apply for it through a sales representative authorized by us. The          
completed application is sent to us and we decide whether to accept or reject   
it. If the application is accepted, a contract is prepared and executed by our  
legally authorized officers. The contract is then sent to you through your      
sales representative. See Distribution of the contracts.                        

When a completed application and all other information necessary for processing 
a purchase order is received at our servicing office, an initial purchase       
payment will be priced no later than two business days after we receive the     
order. If you submit your application and/or initial purchase payment to your   
agent (other than through Lincoln Financial Advisors Corp.), we will not begin  
processing your purchase order until we receive the application and initial     
purchase payment from your agent's broker-dealer. While attempting to finish an 
incomplete application, we may hold the initial purchase payment for no more    
than five business days. If the incomplete application cannot be completed      
within those five days, you will be informed of the reasons, and the purchase   
payment will be returned immediately. Once the application is complete, the     
initial purchase payment must be priced within two business days.               

Who can invest                                                                  
To apply for a contract, you must be of legal age in New York where the         
contracts may be lawfully sold and also be eligible to participate in any of    
the qualified or nonqualified plans for which the contracts are designed. The   
contractowner, joint owner, and annuitant cannot be older than age 89.          

If you are purchasing the contract through a tax-favored arrangement, including 
traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs, you should consider carefully the costs and     
benefits of that contract (including annuity income benefits) before purchasing 
the contract, since the tax-favored arrangement itself provides tax-sheltered   
growth.                                                                         

Replacement of existing insurance                                               
Careful consideration should be given prior to surrendering or withdrawing      
money from an existing contract to purchase the contract described in this      
Prospectus. Surrender charges may be imposed on your existing contract and/or a 
new surrender charge period may be imposed with the purchase of or transfer     
into a new contract. An investment representative or tax adviser should be      
consulted prior to making an exchange. Cash surrenders from an existing         
contract may be subject to tax and tax penalties.                               

Purchase payments                                                               

Purchase payments are payable to us at a frequency and in an amount selected by 
you in the application. You may change the amount and/or frequency of purchase  
payments at any time. The minimum initial purchase payment is $25,000. The      
minimum annual amount for additional purchase payments is $300 for nonqualified 
and qualified contracts. The minimum payment to the contract at any one time    
must be at least $100 ($25 if transmitted electronically).  If you stop making  
purchase payments, the contract will remain in force as a paid-up               

                                                                            11

contract. However, we may terminate the contract as allowed by New York's       
non-forfeiture law for individual deferred annuities. Purchase payments may be  
made or, if stopped, resumed at any time until the annuity commencement date,   
the surrender of the contract, maturity date or the death of the contractowner, 
whichever comes first. LNY reserves the right to limit purchase payments made   
to the contract.                                                                

Persistency credits                                                             
Contractowners will receive a persistency credit on a quarterly basis after the 
seventh contract anniversary. The amount of the persistency credit is           
calculated by multiplying the contract value, less any purchase payments that   
have not been invested in the contract for at least seven years, by 0.075%.     
This persistency credit will be allocated to the variable subaccounts and the   
fixed account in proportion to the contract value in each variable subaccount   
and fixed account at the time the persistency credit is paid into the contract. 

There is no additional charge to receive this persistency credit, and in no     
case will the persistency credit be less than zero.                             
Valuation date                                                                  
Accumulation and annuity units will be valued once daily at the close of        
trading (normally, 4:00 p.m., New York time) on each day the New York Stock     
Exchange is open (valuation date). On any date other than a valuation date, the 
accumulation unit value and the annuity unit value will not change.             

Allocation of purchase payments                                                 
Purchase payments are placed into the VAA's subaccounts, each of which invests  
in shares of the class of its corresponding fund of the series, according to    
your instructions.                                                              

The minimum amount of any purchase payment which can be put into any one        
subaccount is $20. Upon allocation to a subaccount, purchase payments are       
converted into accumulation units. The number of accumulation units credited is 
determined by dividing the amount allocated to each subaccount by the value of  
an accumulation unit for that subaccount on the valuation date on which the     
purchase payment is received at our servicing office if received before 4:00    
p.m., New York time. If the purchase payment is received at or after 4:00 p.m., 
New York time, we will use the accumulation unit value computed on the next     
valuation date. Please note: If you submit your purchase payment to your agent  
(other than through Lincoln Financial Advisors Corp.), we will not begin        
processing the purchase payment until we receive it from your agent's           
broker-dealer. The number of accumulation units determined in this way is not   
changed by any subsequent change in the value of an accumulation unit. However, 
the dollar value of an accumulation unit will vary depending not only upon how  
well the underlying fund's investments perform, but also upon the expenses of   
the VAA and the underlying funds.                                               

Valuation of accumulation units                                                 
Purchase payments allocated to the VAA are converted into accumulation units.   
This is done by dividing each purchase payment by the value of an accumulation  
unit for the valuation period during which the purchase payment is allocated to 
the VAA. The accumulation unit value for each subaccount was or will be         
established at the inception of the subaccount. It may increase or decrease     
from valuation period to valuation period. Accumulation unit values are         
affected by investment performance of the funds, expenses, and deduction of     
certain charges. The accumulation unit  value for a subaccount for a later      
valuation period is determined as follows:                                      

(1) The total value of the fund shares held in the subaccount is calculated by  
multiplying the number of fund shares owned by the subaccount at the beginning  
of the valuation period by the net asset value per share of the fund at the end 
of the valuation period, and adding any dividend or other distribution of the   
fund if an ex-dividend date occurs during the valuation period; minus           

(2) The liabilities of the subaccount at the end of the valuation period; these 
liabilities include daily charges imposed on the subaccount, and may include a  
charge or credit with respect to any taxes paid or reserved for by us that we   
determine result from the operations of the VAA; and                            

(3) The result of (2) is divided by the number of subaccount units outstanding  
at the beginning of the valuation period.                                       

The daily charges imposed on a subaccount for any valuation period are equal to 
the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge 
multiplied by the number of calendar days in the valuation period. Because a    
different daily charge is imposed for contracts with the EGMDB than for those   
with the Guarantee of Principal, each of the two types of contracts will have   
different corresponding accumulation unit values on any given day.              

In certain circumstances, and when permitted by law, it may be prudent for us   
to use a different standard industry method for this calculation, called the    
Net Investment Factor method. We will achieve substantially the same result     
using either method.                                                            

Transfers between subaccounts on or before the annuity commencement date        

After the first thirty days from the effective date of your contract, you may   
transfer all or a portion of your investment from one subaccount to another. A  
transfer involves the surrender of accumulation units in one subaccount and the 
purchase of accumulation units in the other subaccount. A transfer will be done 
using the respective accumulation unit values determined at the end             

12                                                                              

P-->N-4/A14th�Page�of�87TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�14th
of the valuation date on which the transfer request is received.                

Transfers without a charge are limited to 12 per contract year. Currently,      
there is no charge for a transfer. However, we reserve the right to impose a    
charge in the future of up to $25 per transfer, for transfers after the first   
12 within a contract year. This limit does not apply to transfers made under    
the automatic transfer programs of dollar cost averaging, portfolio             
rebalancing, or cross-reinvestment elected on forms available from us. (See     
Additional services and the SAI for more information about these programs.) The 
minimum amount which may be transferred between subaccounts is $300 (or the     
entire amount in the subaccount, if less than $300). If the transfer from a     
subaccount would leave you with less than $300 in the subaccount, we may        
transfer the total balance of the subaccount.                                   

A transfer request may be made to our servicing office using written, telephone 
or electronic instructions, if the appropriate authorization is on file with    
us. In order to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent transfers, we may require    
certain identifying information before we will act upon instructions. We may    
also assign the contractowner a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to serve   
as identification. We will not be liable for following instructions we          
reasonably believe are genuine. Telephone requests will be recorded and written 
confirmation of all transfer requests will be mailed to the contractowner on    
the next valuation date.                                                        

Please note that the telephone and/or electronic devices may not always be      
available. Any telephone or electronic device, whether it is yours, your        
service provider's, or your agent's, can experience outages or slow-downs for a 
variety of reasons. These outages or slow-downs may delay or prevent our        
processing of your request. Although we have taken precautions to limit these   
problems at LNY, we cannot promise complete reliability under all               
circumstances. If you are experiencing problems, you should make your transfer  
request by writing to our servicing office.                                     

Requests for transfers will be processed on the valuation date that they are    
received when they are received in our servicing office before the end of the   
valuation date (normally, 4 p.m. New York time).                                

When thinking about a transfer of contract value, you should consider the       
inherent risk involved. Frequent transfers based on short-term expectations may 
increase the risk that a transfer will be made at an inopportune time. This     
contract is not designed for professional market timing organizations or other  
entities using programmed and frequent transfers. Repeated patterns of frequent 
transfers are disruptive to the operation of the subaccounts, and should LNY    
become aware of such disruptive practices, LNY may refuse to permit such        
transfers.                                                                      

Transfers may be delayed as permitted by the 1940 Act. See Delay of payments.   

Transfers to and from the                                                       

general account on or before the                                                

annuity commencement date                                                       

After the first thirty days from the effective date of your contract, you may   
transfer all or any part of the contract value from the subaccount(s) to the    
fixed side of the contract. The minimum amount which can be transferred to the  
fixed side is $300 or the total amount in the subaccount, if less than $300.    
However, if a transfer from a subaccount would leave you with less than $300 in 
the subaccount, we may transfer the total amount to the fixed side.             

You may also transfer all or any part of the contract value from the fixed side 
of your contract to the various sub-account(s) subject to the following         
restrictions: (1) the sum of the percentages of fixed value transferred is      
limited to 25% of the value of the fixed side in any 12  month period and (2)   
the minimum amount which can be transferred is $300 or the amount in the        
fixed account.                                                                  

Currently, there is no charge to you for a transfer. However, we reserve the    
right to impose a charge in the future for any transfers to and from the        
general account.                                                                

For a discussion on telephone and electronic transfers, see Transfers between   
subaccounts on or before the annuity commencement date.                         

Transfers after the annuity commencement date                                   

You may transfer all or a portion of your investment in one subaccount to       
another subaccount or to the fixed side of the contract. Those transfers will   
be limited to three times per contract year. Currently, there is no charge for  
these transfers. However, we reserve the right in the future to impose a charge 
of up to $25 per transfer. No transfers are allowed from the fixed side of the  
contract to the subaccounts.                                                    

Additional services                                                             
There are four additional services available to you at no extra charge under    
your contract: dollar-cost averaging (DCA), automatic withdrawal service (AWS), 
cross-reinvestment service and portfolio rebalancing. In order to take          
advantage of one of these services, you will need to complete the election form 
for the service that is available from us. For further detailed information on  
these services, please see Additional services in the SAI.                      

Dollar-cost averaging allows you to transfer amounts from the fixed account or  
certain variable subaccounts into the variable subaccounts on a monthly basis.  
If you have more than one DCA program in effect at a time, the interest rate    
credited for the initial DCA program will not be extended to additional DCA     
programs. See the SAI for additional provisions applicable to multiple DCA      
programs.                                                                       

The automatic withdrawal service (AWS) provides for an automatic periodic       
withdrawal of your contract value.                                              

                                                                            13

P-->N-4/A15th�Page�of�87TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
The cross-reinvestment service allows you to automatically transfer the account 
value in a designated variable subaccount that exceeds a baseline amount to     
another specific variable subaccount at specific intervals.                     

Portfolio rebalancing is an option that restores to a pre-determined level the  
percentage of contract value allocated to each variable account subaccount. The 
rebalancing may take place monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually.       

Death benefit before the annuity commencement date                              
You may designate a beneficiary during your lifetime and change the beneficiary 
by filing a written request with our servicing office. Each change of           
beneficiary revokes any previous designation. We reserve the right to request   
that you send us the contract for endorsement of a change of beneficiary. You   
may pre-select an annuity payout option as a method of paying the death benefit 
to a beneficiary. If you do, the beneficiary cannot change this payout option.  

Upon the death of the contractowner, a death benefit will be paid to the        
beneficiary. Upon the death of a joint owner, the death benefit will be paid to 
the surviving joint owner. Upon the death of an annuitant who is not the        
contractowner or joint owner, a death benefit may be paid to the contractowner  
(and joint owner, if applicable, in equal shares). If the contractowner is a    
corporation or other non-individual (non-natural person), the death of the      
annuitant will be treated as death of the contractowner. Only the contract      
value as of the day LNY approves the payment of the claim is available on the   
death of the contractowner or joint owner, if the contractowner or joint owner  
was changed subsequent to the effective date of this contract for any reason    
other than death. Death benefits are taxable. See Federal tax matters.          

If an annuitant who is not the contractowner or joint owner dies, then the      
contingent annuitant, if named, becomes the annuitant and no death benefit is   
payable on the death of the annuitant. If no contingent annuitant is named, the 
contractowner (or younger of joint owners) becomes the annuitant.               
Alternatively, a death benefit may be paid to the contractowner (and joint      
owner, if applicable, in equal shares) provided the annuitant named on the      
contract has not been changed (except within the first 30 days after the        
contract is issued or upon the death of a prior annuitant).                     

Notification of the election of this death benefit must be received by LNY      
within 75 days of the death of the annuitant. If no contractowner is living on  
the date of death of the annuitant, the death benefit will be available to the  
beneficiary. The contract terminates when any death benefit is paid due to the  
death of the annuitant. A death benefit payable on the death of the annuitant   
will not be paid if the annuitant has been changed subsequent to the effective  
date of this contract unless the change occurred during the first 30 days       
subsequent to the effective date of the contract, or because of the death of a  
prior annuitant.                                                                

Enhanced Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (EGMDB)                               

The death benefit, if the EGMDB is in effect, will be equal to the greatest of: 
(1) the contract value as of the day on which LNY approves the payment of the   
claim; (2) the sum of all purchase payments decreased by withdrawals (including 
applicable charges and premium taxes incurred) in the same proportion that      
withdrawals (including applicable charges and premium taxes incurred) reduced   
the contract value; or (3) the highest contract value which the contract        
attains on any contract anniversary (including the inception date) (determined  
before the allocation of any purchase payments on that contract anniversary)    
prior to the 81st birthday of the deceased contractowner, joint owner or        
annuitant and prior to the death of the contractowner, joint owner or annuitant 
for whom the death claim is approved for payment. The highest contract value is 
increased by purchase payments and is decreased by withdrawals subsequent to    
that anniversary date (including applicable charges and premium taxes incurred) 
in the same proportion that withdrawals (including applicable charges and       
premium taxes incurred) reduced the contract value.                             

When applying for a contract, an applicant can request a contract without the   
EGMDB. The EGMDB is not available under contracts issued to a contractowner,    
joint owner or annuitant, who is age 80 or older at the time of issuance.       

After a contract is issued, the contractowner may discontinue the EGMDB at any  
time by completing the Enhanced Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit Discontinuance 
form and sending it to our servicing office. The benefit will be discontinued   
as of the valuation date we receive the request, and we will stop deducting the 
charge for the benefit as of that date. See Charges and other deductions.       

Guarantee of Principal Death Benefit                                            

If the EGMDB is not in effect, the death benefit will be equal to the Guarantee 
of Principal death benefit, which is equal to the greater of contract value as  
of the day LNY approves the payment of the claim or the sum of all purchase     
payments minus any withdrawals, including any applicable charges, or premium    
taxes incurred.                                                                 

General death benefit information                                               

The Guarantee of Principal death benefit and the EGMDB are separate death       
benefit elections. Only one of these death benefit elections may be in effect   
at any one time.                                                                

If there are joint owners, upon the death of the first contractowner, LNY will  
pay a death benefit to the surviving joint owner. The surviving joint owner     
will be treated as the primary, designated beneficiary. Any other beneficiary   
designation on record at the time of death will be treated as a contingent      
beneficiary. If the surviving joint owner is the spouse of the deceased joint   
owner he/she                                                                    

14                                                                              

P-->N-4/A16th�Page�of�87TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
may continue the contract as sole contractowner. Upon the death of the spouse   
who continues the contract, LNY will pay a death benefit to the designated      
beneficiary(s).                                                                 

Upon the death of a contractowner, joint owner or annuitant, if the surviving   
spouse continues the contract, any portion of the death benefit that would have 
been payable (if the contract had not been continued) that exceeds the current  
contract value will be credited to the contract. This provision applies only    
one time for each contract.                                                     

The value of the death benefit will be determined as of the date on which the   
death claim is approved for payment. Approval of payment will occur after       
receipt of: (1) proof (e.g. an original certified death certificate), or any    
other proof of death satisfactory to us, of the death of the contractowner; (2) 
written authorization for payment; and (3) our receipt of all required claim    
forms, fully completed (including selection of a settlement option). If the     
beneficiary is a minor, court documents appointing the guardian/custodian must  
be submitted.                                                                   

Unless otherwise provided in the beneficiary designation, one of the following  
procedures will take place on the death of a beneficiary:                       

1.If any beneficiary dies before the contractowner, that beneficiary's interest 
will go to any other beneficiaries named, according to their respective     
interests (There are no restrictions on the beneficiary's use of the        
proceeds.); and/or                                                          

2.If no beneficiary survives the contractowner, the proceeds will be paid to    
the contractowner's estate.                                                 

Unless the contractowner has already selected a settlement option, the          
beneficiary must choose the method of payment of the death benefit. The death   
benefit payable to the beneficiary or joint owner must be distributed within    
five years of the contractowner's date of death unless the beneficiary begins   
receiving within one year of the contractowner's death the distribution in the  
form of a life annuity or an annuity for a designated period not extending      
beyond the beneficiary's life expectancy.                                       

If the death benefit becomes payable, the recipient may elect to receive        
payment either in the form of a lump sum settlement or an annuity payout. Upon  
the death of the annuitant Federal law requires that an annuity payout be made  
no later than 60 days after LNY has approved the death claim.                   

If a lump sum settlement is elected, the proceeds will be mailed within seven   
days of approval by us of the claim subject to the laws, regulations and tax    
code governing payment of death benefits. This payment may be postponed as      
permitted by the 1940 Act.                                                      

Notwithstanding any provision of the contract to the contrary, the payment of   
death benefits provided under the contract must be made in compliance with Code 
Section 72(s) or 401(a)(9) as applicable, as amended from time to time. Death   
benefits may be taxable. See Federal tax matters.                               

Annuitant                                                                       
The following rules apply prior to the annuity commencement date. You may name  
only one annuitant [unless you are an exempt organization under Internal        
Revenue Code section 501(c), then you can name two joint annuitants]. You (if   
the contractowner is a natural person) have the right to change the annuitant   
at any time by notifying the servicing office of the change. The new annuitant  
must be under age 90 as of the effective date of the change. This change may    
cause a reduction of the death benefit on the death of the annuitant. See The   
con- tracts--Death benefit before the annuity commencement date. A contingent   
annuitant may be named or changed by notifying the servicing office in writing. 

On or after the annuity commencement date, the annuitant or joint annuitants    
may not be changed. Contingent annuitant designations are no longer applicable. 

Ownership                                                                       
As contractowner, you have all rights under the contract. According to New York 
law, the assets of the VAA are held for the exclusive benefit of all            
contractowners and their designated beneficiaries; and the assets of the VAA    
are not chargeable with liabilities arising from any other business that we may 
conduct. Qualified contracts may not be assigned or transferred except as       
permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 and    
upon written notification to us. We assume no responsibility for the validity   
or effect of any assignment. Consult your tax advisor about the tax             
consequences of an assignment.                                                  

Joint ownership                                                                 
The joint owners shall be treated as having equal undivided interests in the    
contract. Either owner, independently of the other, may exercise any ownership  
rights in this contract. Not more than two owners (an owner and joint owner)    
may be named and contingent owners are not permitted.                           

Surrenders and withdrawals                                                      

Before the annuity commencement date, we will allow the surrender of the        
contract or a withdrawal of the contract value upon your written request,       
subject to the rules discussed below. Surrender or withdrawal rights after the  
annuity commencement date depend upon the annuity payout option selected. See   
Annuity payouts--Annuity options.                                               

The amount available upon surrender/withdrawal is the cash surrender value      
(contract value less any applicable charges, fees, and taxes) at the end of the 
valuation period during which the written request for surrender/withdrawal is   
received at the servicing office. Unless a request for withdrawal specifies     
otherwise, withdrawals will be made from all subaccounts within the VAA and     
from the general account in the same proportion that the amount of withdrawal   
bears to the total contract value. The minimum amount which can be withdrawn is 

                                                                            15

P-->N-4/A17th�Page�of�87TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
$300. Unless prohibited, surrender/withdrawal payments will be mailed within    
seven days after we receive a valid written request at the servicing office.    
The payment may be postponed as permitted by the 1940 Act.                      

The tax consequences of a surrender/withdrawal are discussed later in this      
Prospectus. See Federal tax matters.                                            

There are charges associated with surrender of a contract or withdrawal of      
contract value. You may specify whether these charges are deducted from the     
amount you request to be withdrawn or from the remaining contract value. See    
Charges and other deductions.                                                   

Small contract surrenders                                                       

LNY may surrender your IRA or nonqualified contract, in accordance with New     
York law if: 1) your contract value drops below $2,000 for any reason,          
including if your contract value decreases due to the performance of the        
subaccounts you selected; and 2) no purchase payments have been received for    
three (3) full consecutive contract years, or 3) the paid up annuity benefit at 
maturity would be less than $20.00 per month.                                   

At least 60 days before we surrender your contract, we will send you a letter   
at your last address we have on file, to inform you that your contract will be  
surrendered. You will have the opportunity to make additional purchase payments 
to bring your contract value above the minimum level to avoid surrender. If we  
surrender your contract, we will not assess any surrender charge.               

Delay of payments                                                               

Contract proceeds from the VAA will be paid within seven days, except (i) when  
the NYSE is closed (other than weekends and holidays); (ii) times when market   
trading is restricted or the SEC declares an emergency, and we cannot value     
units or the funds cannot redeem shares; or (iii) when the SEC so orders to     
protect contractowners.                                                         

Reinvestment privilege                                                          
You may elect to make a reinvestment purchase with any part of the proceeds of  
a surrender/withdrawal, and we will recredit that portion of the                
surrender/withdrawal charges attributable to the amount returned. This election 
must be made within 30 days of the date of the surrender/withdrawal, and the    
repur-chase must be of a contract covered by this Prospectus. A representation  
must be made that the proceeds being used to make the purchase have retained    
their tax-favored status under an arrangement for which the contracts offered   
by this Prospectus are designed. The number of accumulation units which will be 
credited when the proceeds are reinvested will be based on the value of the     
accumulation unit(s) on the next valuation date. This computation will occur    
following receipt of the proceeds and request for reinvestment at the servicing 
office. You may utilize the reinvestment privilege only once. For tax reporting 
purposes, we will treat a surrender/withdrawal and a subsequent reinvestment    
purchase as separate transactions. You should consult a tax adviser before you  
request a surrender/withdrawal or subsequent reinvestment purchase.             

Amendment of contract                                                           

We reserve the right to amend the contract to meet the requirements of the 1940 
Act or other applicable federal or state laws or regulations. Any changes are   
subject to prior approval by the New York Superintendent of Insurance. If any   
proposed change legally requires a vote of the contractowners, we will notify   
you about the nature of the proposed change and request your vote on the matter 
before implementing such a change. You will be notified in writing of any       
changes, modifications or waivers.                                              

Commissions                                                                     

Commissions are paid to dealers under different commission options. The maximum 
commission paid as a percentage of each purchase payment is 5.00%, with ongoing 
annual compensation of up to 1.00%. Alternate commission schedules are          
available with lower initial commission amounts based on purchase payments,     
plus ongoing annual compensation. At times, additional sales incentives         
(including an annual continuing 0.10% of contract value) may be provided to     
dealers maintaining certain sales volume levels. Upon annuitization, the        
commissions paid to dealers are a maximum of 4.00% of account annuitized and/or 
an annual continuing commission of up to 1.00% (or up to 1.10% for dealers      
maintaining certain sales volume levels) of statutory reserves. These           
commissions are not deducted from purchase payments or contract value; they are 
paid by us.                                                                     

LNY may offer the contracts through its registered representatives or through   
registered representatives of broker-dealers it maintains selling agreements    
with. Registered representatives offering the contracts are registered with the 
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) and their               
broker-dealers are members of the National Association of Securities Dealers,   
Inc. (NASD). Commissions may be paid to such brokerdealers on behalf of their   
registered representatives and these broker-dealers may retain a portion of the 
commissions paid. LNY may pay additional compensation to these broker-dealers   
and/or reimburse them for portions of contract sales expenses. These            
broker-dealers may pay their registered representatives a portion of the        
reimbursement allowance. LNY may pay additional cash benefits and/or offer      
non-cash compensation programs, such as conferences or trips, to its registered 
representatives and/or these broker-dealers.                                    

Contractowner questions                                                         

The obligations to purchasers under the contracts are those of LNY. This        
Prospectus provides a general description of the contract. Questions about your 
contract should be directed to us at 1-800-942-5500.

Annuity payouts                                                                 

When you apply for a contract, you may select any annuity commencement date     
permitted by law.                                                               

The contract provides optional forms of payouts of annuities (annuity options), 
each of which is payable on a variable basis, a fixed basis or a combination of 
both as you specify. The contract provides that all or part of the contract     
value may be used to purchase an annuity.                                       

You may elect annuity payouts in monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual       
installments. If the payouts from any subaccount would be or become less than   
$50, we have the right to reduce their frequency until the payouts are at least 
$50 each. Following are explanations of the annuity options available.          

Annuity options                                                                 
Life Annuity. This option offers a periodic payout during the lifetime of the   
annuitant and ends with the last payout before the death of the annuitant. This 
option offers the highest periodic payout since there is no guarantee of a      
minimum number of payouts or provision for a death benefit for beneficiaries.   
However, there is the risk under this option that the recipient would receive   
no payouts if the annuitant dies before the date set for the first payout; only 
one payout if death occurs before the second scheduled payout, and so on.       

Life Annuity with Guaranteed Period. This option guarantees periodic payouts    
during a designated period, usually 10 or 20 years, and then continues          
throughout the lifetime of the annuitant. The designated period is selected by  
the contractowner.                                                              

Joint Life Annuity. This option offers a periodic payout during the joint       
lifetime of the annuitant and a designated joint annuitant. The payouts         
continue during the lifetime of the survivor.                                   

Joint Life Annuity with Guaranteed Period. This option guarantees periodic      
payouts during a designated period, usually 10 or 20 years, and continues       
during the joint lifetime of the annuitant and a designated joint annuitant.    
The payouts continue during the lifetime of the survivor. The designated period 
is selected by the contractowner.                                               

Joint Life and Two-Thirds Survivor Annuity. This option provides a periodic     
payout during the joint lifetime of the annuitant and a designated joint        
annuitant. When one of the joint annuitants dies, the survivor receives two     
thirds of the periodic payout made when both were alive.                        

Joint Life and Two-Thirds Survivor Annuity with Guaranteed Period. This option  
provides a periodic payout during the joint lifetime of the annuitant and a     
joint annuitant. When one of the joint annuitants dies, the survivor receives   
two thirds of the periodic payout made when both were alive. This option        
further provides that should one or both of the annuitants dies during the      
elected guaranteed period, usually 10 or 20 years, full benefit payment will    
continue for the rest of the guaranteed period.                                 

Unit Refund Life Annuity. This option offers a periodic payout during the       
lifetime of the annuitant with the guarantee that upon death a payout will be   
made of the value of the number of annuity units (see Variable annuity payouts) 
equal to the excess, if any, of: (a) the total amount applied under this option 
divided by the annuity unit value for the date payouts begin, minus (b) the     
annuity units represented by each payout to the annuitant multiplied by the     
number of payouts paid before death. The value of the number of annuity units   
is computed on the date the death claim is approved for payment by the          
servicing office.                                                               

Life Annuity with Cash Refund. This option is only available for fixed annuity  
benefit payments. Payments will be made for the lifetime of the annuitant with  
the guarantee that upon death, should (a) the total dollar amount applied to    
purchase this option be greater than (b) the fixed annuity benefit payment      
multiplied by the number of annuity benefit payments paid prior to death, then  
a refund payment equal to the dollar amount of (a) minus (b) will be made.      

Under the annuity options listed above, you may not make withdrawals. Other     
options, with or without withdrawal features, may be made available by us.      
Options are only available to the extent they are consistent with the           
requirements of the contract as well as Sections 72(s) and 401(a)(9) of the tax 
code, if applicable. A mortality and expense risk charge of 1.30% and the       
charge for administrative services of 0.10% will be assessed on all variable    
annuity payouts,including options that may be offered that do not have a life   
contingency and therefore no mortality risk.                                    

Variable annuity payouts                                                        
Variable annuity payouts will be determined using:                              

1.The contract value on the annuity commencement date less any applicable       
premium taxes;                                                              

2.The annuity tables contained in the contract;                                 

3.The annuity option selected; and                                              

4.The investment performance of the fund(s) selected.                           

To determine the amount of payouts, we make this calculation:                   

1.Determine the dollar amount of the first periodic payout; then                

2.Credit the contract with a fixed number of annuity units equal to the first   
periodic payout divided by the annuity unit value; and                      

3.Calculate the value of the annuity units each period thereafter.              

                                                                            17

Annuity payouts assume an investment return of 3%, 4%, or 5% per year, as       
applied to the applicable mortality table. You must choose your assumed         
interest rate at the time you elect a variable annuity payout on the            
administrative form provided by LNY. The higher the assumed interest rate you   
choose, the higher your initial annuity payment will be. The amount of each     
payout after the initial payout will depend upon how the underlying fund(s)     
perform, relative to the assumed rate. If the actual net investment rate        
(annualized) exceeds the assumed rate, the payment will increase at a rate      
proportional to the amount of such excess. Conversely, if the actual rate is    
less than the assumed rate, annuity payments will decrease. The higher the      
assumed interest rate, the less likely future annuity payments are to increase, 
or the payments will increase more slowly than if a lower assumed rate was      
used. There is a more complete explanation of this calculation in the SAI.      

General information                                                             

The Guarantee of Principal death benefit and the EGMDB are not available after  
the annuity commencement date.                                                  

The annuity commencement date must be on or before the annuitant's 90th         
birthday. You may change the annuity commencement date, change the annuity      
option or change the allocation of the investment among subaccounts up to 30    
days before the scheduled annuity commencement date, upon written notice to the 
servicing office. You must give us at least 30 days notice before the date on   
which you want payouts to begin. Annuity payouts cannot commence within 12      
months of the effective date of the contract. If proceeds become available to a 
beneficiary in a lump sum, the beneficiary may choose any annuity payout option.

Unless you select another option, the contract automatically provides for a     
life annuity with annuity payouts guaranteed for 10 years (on a fixed, variable 
or combination fixed and variable basis, in proportion to the account           
allocations at the time of annuitization) except when a joint life payout is    
required by law. Under any option providing for guaranteed period payouts, the  
number of payouts which remain unpaid at the date of the annuitant's death (or  
surviving annuitant's death in case of joint life annuity) will be paid to your 
beneficiary as payouts become due after LNY is in receipt of: (1) proof,        
satisfactory to LNY of the death; (2) written authorization for payment; and    
(3) all claim forms, fully completed.                                           

Federal tax matters                                                             

Introduction                                                                    
The Federal income tax treatment of the contract is complex and sometimes       
uncertain. The Federal income tax rules may vary with your particular           
circumstances. This discussion does not include all the Federal income tax      
rules that may affect you and your contract. This discussion also does not      
address other Federal tax consequences (including consequences of sales to      
foreign individuals or entities), or state or local tax consequences,           
associated with the contract. As a result, you should always consult a tax      
adviser about the application of tax rules to your individual situation.        

Nonqualified annuities                                                          
This part of the discussion describes some of the Federal income tax rules      
applicable to nonqualified annuities. A nonqualified annuity is a contract not  
issued in connection with a qualified retirement plan, such as an IRA or a      
section 403(b) plan, receiving special tax treatment under the tax code. We may 
not offer nonqualified annuities for all of our annuity products.               

Tax deferral on earnings                                                        
The Federal income tax law generally does not tax any increase in your contract 
value until you receive a contract distribution. However, for this general rule 
to apply, certain requirements must be satisfied:                               

.. An individual must own the contract (or the tax law must treat the contract  
as owned by an individual).                                                 

.. The investments of the VAA must be "adequately diversified" in accordance    
with IRS regulations.                                                       

.. Your right to choose particular investments for a contract must be limited.  

.. The annuity commencement date must not occur near the end of the annuitant's 
life expectancy.                                                            

Contracts not owned by an individual                                            
If a contract is owned by an entity (rather than an individual) the tax code    
generally does not treat it as an annuity contract for Federal income tax       
purposes. This means that the entity owning the contract pays tax currently on  
the excess of the contract value over the purchase payments for the contract.   
Examples of contracts where the owner pays current tax on the contract's        
earnings, bonus credits and persistency credits are contracts issued to a       
corporation or a trust. Exceptions to this rule exist. For example, the tax     
code treats a contract as owned by an individual if the named owner is a trust  
or other entity that holds the contract as an agent for an individual. However, 
this exception does not apply in the case of any employer that owns a contract  
to provide deferred compensation for its employees.                             

Investments in the VAA must be diversified                                      
For a contract to be treated as an annuity for Federal income tax purposes, the 
investments of the VAA must be "adequately diversified." IRS regulations define 
standards for determining whether the investments of the VAA are adequately     
diversified. If the VAA fails to comply with these diversification standards,   
you could be required to pay tax currently on the excess of the                 

18                                                                              

P-->N-4/A20th�Page�of�87TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
contract value over the contract purchase payments. Although we do not control  
the investments of the under lying investment options, we expect that the       
underlying investment options will comply with the IRS regulations so that the  
VAA will be considered "adequately diversified."                                

Restrictions                                                                    
Federal income tax law limits your right to choose particular investments for   
the contract. Because the IRS has not issued guidance specifying those limits,  
the limits are uncertain and your right to allocate contract values among the   
subaccounts may exceed those limits. If so, you would be treated as the owner   
of the assets of the VAA and thus subject to current taxation on the income,    
bonus credits, persistency credits and gains from those assets. We do not know  
what limits may be set by the IRS in any guidance that it may issue and whether 
any such limits will apply to existing contracts. We reserve the right to       
modify the contract without your consent to try to prevent the tax law from     
considering you as the owner of the assets of the VAA.                          

Loss of interest deduction                                                      
After June 8, 1997, if a contract is issued to a taxpayer that is not an        
individual, or if a contract is held for the benefit of an entity, the entity   
will lose a portion of its deduction for otherwise deductible interest expenses.

Age at which annuity payouts begin                                              
Federal income tax rules do not expressly identify a particular age by which    
annuity payouts must begin. How ever, those rules do require that an annuity    
contract provide for amortization, through annuity payouts, of the contract's   
purchase payments, bonus credits, persistency credits and earnings. If annuity  
payouts under the contract begin or are scheduled to begin on a date past the   
annuitant's 85th birthday, it is possible that the tax law will not treat the   
contract as an annuity for Federal income tax purposes. In that event, you      
would be currently taxed on the excess of the contract value over the purchase  
payments of the contract.                                                       

Tax treatment of payments                                                       
We make no guarantees regarding the tax treatment of any contract or of any     
transaction involving a contract. However, the rest of this discussion assumes  
that your contract will be treated as an annuity for Federal income tax         
purposes and that the tax law will not tax any increase in your contract value  
until there is a distribution from your contract.                               

Taxation of withdrawals and surrenders                                          
You will pay tax on withdrawals to the extent your contract value exceeds your  
purchase payments in the contract. This income (and all other income from your  
contract) is considered ordinary income (and does not receive capital gains     
treatment). A higher rate of tax is paid on ordinary income than on capital     
gains. You will pay tax on a surrender to the extent the amount you receive     
exceeds your purchase payments. In certain circumstances, your purchase         
payments are reduced by amounts received from your contract that were not       
included in income.                                                             

Taxation of annuity payouts                                                     

The tax code imposes tax on a portion of each annuity payout (at ordinary       
income tax rates) and treats a portion as a nontaxable return of your purchase  
payments in the contract. We will notify you annually of the taxable amount of  
your annuity payout. Once you have recovered the total amount of the purchase   
payment in the contract, you will pay tax on the full amount of your annuity    
payouts. If annuity payouts end because of the annuitant's death and before the 
total amount in the contract have been distributed, the amount not received     
will generally be deductible.                                                   

Taxation of death benefits                                                      
We may distribute amounts from your contract because of the death of a          
contractowner or an annuitant. The tax treatment of these amounts depends on    
whether you or the annuitant dies before or after the annuity commencement date.

.. Death prior to the annuity commencement date--                               

  . If the beneficiary receives death benefits under an annuity payout option,
they are taxed in the same manner as annuity payouts.                 

.. If the beneficiary does not receive death benefits under an annuity payout   
option, they are taxed in the same manner as a withdrawal.                  

.. Death after the annuity commencement date--                                  

. If death benefits are received in accordance with the existing annuity  
  payout option, they are excludible from income if they do not exceed the
purchase payments not yet distributed from the contract. All annuity  
payouts in excess of the purchase payments not previously received are
includible in income.                                                 

. If death benefits are received in a lump sum, the tax law imposes tax on
    the amount of death benefits which exceeds the amount of purchase payments
not previously received.                                              

Penalty taxes payable on withdrawals, surrenders, or annuity payouts            
The tax code may impose a 10% penalty tax on any distribution from your         
contract which you must include in your gross income. The 10% penalty tax does  
not apply if one of several exceptions exists. These exceptions include         
withdrawals, surrenders, or annuity payouts that:                               

.. you receive on or after you reach age 59 1/2,                                

.. you receive because you became disabled (as defined in the tax law),         

                                                                            19

P-->N-4/A21st�Page�of�87TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
.. a beneficiary receives on or after your death, or                            

.. you receive as a series of substantially equal periodic payments for your    
life (or life expectancy).                                                  

Special rules if you own more than one annuity contract                         
In certain circumstances, you must combine some or all of the nonqualified      
annuity contracts you own in order to determine the amount of an annuity        
payout, a surrender, or a withdrawal that you must include in income. For       
example, if you purchase two or more deferred annuity contracts from the same   
life insurance company (or its affiliates) during any calendar year, the tax    
code treats all such contracts as one contract. Treating two or more contracts  
as one contract could affect the amount of a surrender, a withdrawal or an      
annuity payout that you must include in income and the amount that might be     
subject to the penalty tax described previously.                                

Loans and assignments                                                           
Except for certain qualified contracts, the tax code treats any amount received 
as a loan under your contract, and any assignment or pledge (or agreement to    
assign or pledge) any portion of your contract value, as a withdrawal of such   
amount or portion.                                                              

Gifting a contract                                                              

If you transfer ownership of your contract to a person other than your spouse   
(or to your former spouse in- cident to divorce), and receive a payment less    
than your contract's value, you will pay tax on your contract value to the      
extent it exceeds your purchase payments not previously received. The new       
owner's purchase payments in the contract would then be increased to reflect    
the amount included in income.                                                  

Charges for a contract's death benefit                                          
Your contract automatically includes a basic death benefit. Certain             
enhancements to the basic death benefit may also be available to you. The cost  
of the basic death benefit and any enhancements to such death benefit are       
deducted from your contract. It is possible that the tax law may treat all or a 
portion of the death benefit charge as a contract withdrawal.                   

Qualified retirement plans                                                      
We also designed the contracts for use in connection with certain types of      
retirement plans that receive favorable treatment under the tax code. Contracts 
issued to or in connection with a qualified retirement plan are called          
"qualified contracts." We issue contracts for use with various types of         
qualified plans. The Federal income tax rules applicable to those plans are     
complex and varied. As a result, this Prospectus does not attempt to provide    
more than general information about the use of the contract with the various    
types of qualified plans. Persons planning to use the contract in connection    
with a qualified plan should obtain advice from a competent tax adviser.        

Types of qualified contracts and terms of contracts                             

Currently, we issue contracts in connection with the following types of         
qualified plans:                                                                

.. Individual Retirement Accounts and Annuities ("Traditional IRAs")            

.. Roth IRAs                                                                    

.. Traditional IRA that is part of a Simplified Employee Pension Plan ("SEP")   

.. SIMPLE 401(k) plans (Savings Incentive Matched Plan for Employees)           

.. 403(b) plans (public school system and tax-exempt organization annuity plans)

.. 401(a) plans (qualified corporate employee pension and profit-sharing plans) 

.. 403(a) plans (qualified annuity plans)                                       

.. H.R. 10 or Keogh Plans (self-employed individual plans)                      

.. 457(b) plans (deferred compensation plans for state and local governments and
tax-exempt organizations).                                                  

We may issue a contract for use with other types of qualified plans in the      
future. We may not offer certain types of qualified plans for all of our        
annuity products.                                                               

We will amend contracts to be used with a qualified plan as generally necessary 
to conform to the tax law requirements for the type of plan. However, the       
rights of a person to any qualified plan benefits may be subject to the plan's  
terms and conditions, regardless of the contract's terms and conditions. In     
addition, we are not bound by the terms and conditions of qualified plans to    
the extent such terms and conditions contradict the contract, unless we consent.

Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001                       
The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA") made a 
number of changes to the rules pertaining to qualified plans. These changes     
became effective January 1, 2002. Some changes that EGTRRA has introduced are   
the ability to move money from traditional IRAs to other qualified plans (and   
from qualified plans to traditional IRAs), increased contribution amounts to    
qualified plans and catch-up contributions to IRAs. It is important to note     
that while the contribution limits for federal tax purposes have increased,     
applicable state law may not permit increased contributions to your IRAs or     
other qualified plans. Applicable state law may also limit your ability to move 
your funds among your various qualified plans.

Tax treatment of qualified contracts                                            
The Federal income tax rules applicable to qualified plans and qualified        
contracts vary with the type of plan and contract. For example,                 

.. Federal tax rules limit the amount of purchase payments that can be made, and
 the tax deduction or exclusion that may be allowed for the purchase payments.
These limits vary depending on the type of qualified plan and the plan      
participant's specific circumstances, e.g., the participant's compensation. 

.. Under most qualified plans, such as a traditional IRA, the owner must begin  
receiving payments from the contract minimum amounts by a certain age,      
 typically age 70 1/2. Other qualified plans may allow the participant to take
required distributions upon the later of reaching age 70 1/2 or retirement. 

.. Loans are allowed under certain types of qualified plans, but Federal income 
tax rules prohibit loans under other types of qualified plans. For example, 
Federal income tax rules permit loans under some section 403(b) plans, but  
 prohibit loans under Traditional and Roth IRAs. If allowed, loans are subject
to a variety of limitations, including restrictions as to the loan amount,  
the loan's duration, the rate of interest, and the manner of repayment. Your
contract or plan may not permit loans.                                      

Tax treatment of payments                                                       
The Federal income tax rules generally include distributions from a qualified   
contract in the recipient's income as ordinary income. These taxable            
distributions will include purchase payments that were deductible or excludible 
from income. Thus, under many qualified contracts, the total amount received is 
included in income since a deduction or exclusion from income was taken for     
purchase payments. There are exceptions. For example, you do not include        
amounts received from a Roth IRA in income if certain conditions are satisfied. 

Required minimum distributions                                                  
Under most qualified plans, you must begin receiving payments from the contract 
minimum amounts by the later of age 70 1/2 or retirement. You are required to   
take distributions from your traditional IRAs beginning in the year you reach   
age 70 1/2. If you own a Roth IRA, you are not required to receive minimum      
distributions from your Roth IRA during your life.                              

Failure to comply with the minimum distribution rules applicable to certain     
qualified plans, such as Traditional IRAs, will result in the imposition of an  
excise tax. This excise tax equals 50% of the amount by which a minimum         
required distribution exceeds the actual distribution from the qualified plan.  

The IRS has issued new proposed regulations concerning required minimum         
distributions. The proposed regulations may impact the distribution method you  
have chosen and the amount of your distributions. Under new proposed            
regulations, the presence of an enhanced death benefit may require you to take  
additional distributions. Please contact your tax adviser regarding any tax     
ramifications.                                                                  

Federal penalty taxes payable on distributions                                  
The tax code may impose a 10% penalty tax on a distribution from a qualified    
contract that must be included in income. The tax code does not impose the      
penalty tax if one of several exceptions applies. The exceptions vary depending 
on the type of qualified contract you purchase. For example, in the case of an  
IRA, exceptions provide that the penalty tax does not apply to a withdrawal,    
surrender, or annuity payout:                                                   

.. received on or after the annuitant reaches age 59 1/2,                       

.. received on or after the annuitant's death or because of the annuitant's     
disability (as defined in the tax law),                                     

.. received as a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the        
annuitant's life (or life expectancy), or                                   

.. received as reimbursement for certain amounts paid for medical care.         

These exceptions, as well as certain others not described here, generally apply 
to taxable distributions from other qualified plans. However, the specific      
requirements of the exception may vary.                                         

Transfers and direct rollovers                                                  
As a result of EGTRRA, you may be able to move funds between different types of 
qualified plans, such as 403(b) and 457(b) governmental plans, by means of a    
rollover or transfer. You may be able to rollover or transfer amounts between   
qualified plans and traditional IRAs. These rules do not apply to Roth IRAs and 
457(b) nongovernmental tax-exempt plans. There are special rules that apply to  
rollovers, direct rollovers and transfers (including rollovers or transfers of  
after-tax amounts). If the applicable rules are not followed, you may incur     
adverse Federal income tax consequences, including paying taxes which you might 
not otherwise have had to pay. Before we send a rollover distribution, we will  
provide a notice explaining tax withholding requirements (see Federal Income    
Tax Withholding). We are not required to send you such notice for your IRA. You 
should always consult your tax adviser before you move or attempt to move any   
funds.                                                                          

Federal income tax withholding                                                  
We will withhold and remit to the IRS a part of the taxable portion of each     
distribution made under a contract unless you notify us prior to the            
distribution that tax is not to be withheld. In certain circumstances, Federal  
income tax rules may require us to withhold tax. At the                         

                                                                            21

P-->N-4/A23rd�Page�of�87TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
time a withdrawal, surrender, or annuity payout is requested, we will give you  
an explanation of the withholding requirements.                                 

Certain payments from your contract may be considered eligible rollover         
distributions (even if such payments are not being rolled over). Such           
distributions may be subject to special tax withholding requirements. The       
Federal income tax withholding rules require that we withhold 20% of the        
eligible rollover distribution from the payment amount, unless you elect to     
have the amount directly transferred to certain qualified plans or contracts.   
The IRS requires that tax be withheld, even if you have requested otherwise.    
Such tax withholding requirements are generally applicable to 401(a), 403(a) or 
(b), HR 10, and 457(b) governmental plans and contracts used in connection with 
these types of plans.                                                           

Tax status of LNY                                                               

Under existing Federal income tax laws, LNY does not pay tax on investment      
income and realized capital gains of the VAA. LNY does not expect that it will  
incur any Federal income tax liability on the income and gains earned by the    
VAA. Therefore, we do not impose a charge for Federal income taxes. If Federal  
income tax law changes and we must pay tax on some or all of the income and     
gains earned by the VAA, we may impose a charge against the VAA to pay the      
taxes.                                                                          

Changes in the law                                                              
The above discussion is based on the tax code, IRS regulations, and             
interpretations existing on the date of this Prospectus. However, Congress, the 
IRS, and the courts may modify these authorities, sometimes retroactively.      

Voting rights                                                                   

As required by law, we will vote the series shares held in the VAA at meetings  
of the shareholders of the series. The voting will be done according to the     
instructions of contractowners who have interests in any subaccounts which      
invest in classes of funds of the series. If the 1940 Act or any regulation     
under it should be amended or if present interpretations should change, and if  
as a result we determine that we are permitted to vote the series shares in our 
own right, we may elect to do so.                                               

The number of votes which you have the right to cast will be determined by      
applying your percentage interest in a subaccount to the total number of votes  
attributable to the subaccount. In determining the number of votes, fractional  
shares will be recognized.                                                      

Series shares of a class held in a subaccount for which no timely instructions  
are received will be voted by us in proportion to the voting instructions which 
are received for all contracts participating in that subaccount. Voting         
instructions to abstain on any item to be voted on will be applied on a         
pro-rata basis to reduce the number of votes eligible to be cast.               

Whenever a shareholder's meeting is called, each person having a voting         
interest in a subaccount will receive proxy voting material, reports and other  
materials relating to the series. Since the series engages in shared funding,   
other persons or entities besides LNY may vote series shares. See Fund shares.  

Distribution of the contracts                                                   

American Funds Distributors, Inc. (AFD), 333 South Hope Street, Los Angeles, CA
90071, is the distributor and principal underwriter of the contracts. They will

who participates in the VAA is subject to the risk of a market loss during the  
free-look period.

General information and                                                         
history of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York ("LNY")                   

LNY is a life insurance company founded in New York on June 6, 1996. LNY is a   
subsidiary of Lincoln Life. Lincoln Life is one of the largest stock life       
insurance companies in the United States. Lincoln Life, an Indiana corporation, 
is owned by Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) which is also organized under Indiana  
law. LNC's primary businesses are insurance and financial services.             

Special terms                                                                   

The special terms used in this SAI are the ones defined in the Prospectus. In

Services                                                                        

Independent auditors                                                            
The financial statements of the variable annuity account (VAA) and the          
statutory-basis financial statements of LNY appearing in this SAI and           
Registration Statement have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent      
auditors, 2300 National City Center, 110 West Berry Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana
46802, as set forth in their reports also appearing elsewhere in this document  
and in the Registration Statement. The financial statements audited by Ernst &  
Young LLP have been included in this document in reliance on their reports      
given on their authority as experts in accounting and auditing.                 

Keeper of records                                                               
All accounts, books, records and other documents which are required to be       
maintained for the VAA are maintained by LNY or by third parties responsible to 
LNY. We have entered into an agreement with the Delaware Management Company,    
2005 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19203, to provide accounting services to   
the VAA. No separate charge against the assets of the VAA is made by LNY for    
this service. Administrative services necessary for the operation of the VAA    
and the contracts are currently provided by Lincoln Life. However, neither the  
assets of Lincoln Life nor the assets of LNC support the obligations of Lincoln 
Life under the contracts.                                                       

Principal underwriter                                                           

LNY has contracted with American Funds Distributors, Inc. (AFD), 333 South Hope 
Street, Los Angeles, California 90071, a licensed broker-dealer, to distribute  
the contracts through certain legally authorized sales persons and              
organizations (brokers). AFD and its brokers are compensated under a standard   
compensation schedule.                                                          

In 2001, AFD received underwriting commissions of $50,887 and retained $38,988. 

Purchase of securities being offered                                            

The contracts are offered to the public through certain securities              
broker/dealers who have entered into selling agreements with AFD and whose      
personnel are legally authorized to sell annuity products. There are no special 
purchase plans for any class of prospective buyers. However, under certain      
limited circumstances described in the Prospectus under the section Charges and 
other deductions, the surrender charge may be reduced or waived.                

Both before and after the annuity commencement date, there are exchange         
privileges between subaccounts, and from the VAA to the General Account subject 
to restrictions set out in the Prospectus. See The contracts, in the            
Prospectus. No exchanges are permitted between the VAA and other separate       
accounts.                                                                       

The offering of the contracts is continuous.                                    

Calculation of investment results                                               

The paragraphs set forth below represent yield and total return performance     
information for the VAA and the subaccounts calculated in several different     
ways.                                                                           

The seven-day yield is determined by calculating the change in unit value for   
the base period (the 7-day period ended December 31.); then dividing this       
figure by the account value at the beginning of the period; then annualizing    
this result by the factor of 365/7. This yield includes all deductions charged  
to the contractowner's account, and excludes any realized gains and losses from 
the sale of securities.                                                         

Standard investment results:                                                    
Standard performance is based on a formula to calculate performance that is     
prescribed by the SEC. Under rules issued by the SEC, standard performance must 
be included in any marketing material that discusses the                        

B-2

performance of the VAA and the subaccounts. This information represents past    
performance and does not indicate or represent future performance.              

Average annual return for each period is determined by finding the average      
annual compounded rate of return over each period that would equate the initial 
amount invested to the ending redeemable value for that period, according to    
the following formula:                                                          

P(1+T)n = ERV 

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                         
Where:   P =   a hypothetical initial purchase payment of
               $1,000                                    
         T =   average annual total return for the       
               period in question                        
         N =   number of years                           
       ERV =   ending redeemable value (as of the end    
               of the period in question) of a           
               hypothetical $1,000 purchase payment      
               made at the beginning of the 1-year,      
               5-year, or 10-year period in question     
               (or fractional period thereof)            

The formula assumes that: (1) all recurring fees have been charged to the       
contractowner accounts; (2) all applicable non-recurring charges (including any 
surrender charges) are deducted at the end of the period in question; and (3)   
there will be a complete redemption upon the anniversary of the 1-year, 5-year, 
or 10-year period in question.                                                  

In accordance with SEC guidelines, we will report standard performance back to  
the first date that a fund became available in the VAA. Because standard        
performance reporting periods of less than one year could be misleading, we may 
report "N/A's" for standard performance until one year after a fund became      
available in the VAA.                                                           

                                                                           B-3

Non-standard investment results:                                                

The VAA may report its results over various periods--daily, monthly,            
three-month, six-month, year-to-date, yearly (fiscal year), three, five, ten    
years or more and lifetime--and compare its results to indices and other        
variable annuities in sales materials including advertisements, brochures and   
reports. Performance information for the periods prior to the date that a fund  
became available in the VAA will be calculated based on (1) the performance of  
the fund adjusted for contract charges (ie: mortality and expense risk fees,    
any applicable administrative charges, and the management and other expenses of 
the fund) and (2) the assumption that the subaccounts were in existence for the 
same periods as indicated for the fund. It may or may not reflect charges for   
any riders (ie: EGMDB) that were in effect during the time periods shown. This  
performance is referred to as non-standardized performance data. Such results   
may be computed on a cumulative and/or annualized basis. We may provide         
illustrations of income payments and values during the annuity payout period,   
based on historical or hypothetical rates of return that are not guaranteed. We 
may also report non-standard performance assuming you deposited $10,000 into a  
subaccount at inception of the underlying fund or 10 years ago (whichever is    
less). This non-standard performance may be shown as a graph illustrating how   
that deposit would have increased or decreased in value over time based on the  
performance of the underlying fund adjusted for contract charges. This          
information represents past performance and does not indicate or represent      
future performance. The investment return and value of a contract will          
fluctuate so that contractowner's investment may be worth more or less than the 
original investment. Cumulative quotations are arrived at by calculating the    
change in accumulation unit value between the first and last day of the base    
period being measured, and expressing the difference as a percentage of the     
unit value at the beginning of the base period. Annualized quotations are       
arrived at by applying a formula which reflects the level rate of return, which 
if earned over the entire base period, would produce the cumulative return.     

The performance numbers in the following tables do not reflect surrender        
charges.

Annuity payouts                                                                 

Variable annuity payouts                                                        
Variable annuity payouts will be determined on the basis of: (1) the dollar     
value of the contract on the annuity commencement date; (2) the annuity tables  
contained in the contract; (3) the type of annuity option selected; and (4) the 
investment results of the fund(s) selected. In order to determine the amount of 
variable annuity payouts, LNY makes the following calculation: first, it        
determines the dollar amount of the first payout; second, it credits the        
contract with a fixed number of annuity units based on the amount of the first  
payout; and third, it calculates the value of the annuity units each period     
thereafter. These steps are explained below.                                    

The dollar amount of the first periodic variable annuity payout is determined   
by applying the total value of the accumulation units credited under the        
contract valued as of the annuity commencement date (less any premium taxes) to 
the annuity tables contained in the contract. The first variable annuity payout 
will be paid 14 days after the annuity commencement date. This day of the month 
will become the day on which all future annuity payouts will be paid. Amounts   
shown in the tables are based on the 1983 Table "a" Individual Annuity          
Mortality Tables, modified, with an assumed investment return at the rate of    
3%, 4% or 5% per annum. The first annuity payout is determined by multiplying   
the benefit per $1,000 of value shown in the contract tables by the number of   
thousands of dollars of value accumulated under the contract. These annuity     
tables vary according to the form of annuity selected and the age of the        
annuitant at the annuity commencement date. The assumed interest rate stated    
above is the measuring point for subsequent annuity payouts. If the actual net  
investment rate (annualized) exceeds the assumed interest rate, the payout will 
increase at a rate equal to the amount of such excess. Conversely, if the       
actual rate is less than the assumed interest rate, annuity payouts will        
decrease. If the assumed rate of interest were to be increased, annuity payouts 
would start at a higher level but would decrease more rapidly or increase more  
slowly.                                                                         

LNY will use sex distinct annuity tables in the contracts, except for those     
contracts associated with employer sponsored plans and where prohibited by law. 

At an annuity commencement date, the contract is credited with annuity units    
for each subaccount on which variable annuity payouts are based. The number of  
annuity units to be credited is determined by dividing the amount of the first  
periodic payout by the value of an annuity unit in each subaccount selected.    
Although the number of annuity units is fixed by this process, the value of     
such units will vary with the value of the underlying fund. The amount of the   
second and subsequent periodic payouts is determined by multiplying the         
contractowner's fixed number of annuity units in each subaccount by the         
appropriate annuity unit value for the valuation date ending 14 days prior to   
the date that payout is due.                                                    

The value of each subaccount's annuity unit will be set initially at an         
arbitrary dollar amount. The annuity unit value for each subaccount at the end  
of any valuation date is determined by multiplying the subaccount annuity unit  
value for the immediately preceding valuation date by the product of:           

(a)The net investment factor of the subaccount for the valuation period for     
which the annuity unit value is being determined, and                     

(b)A factor to neutralize the assumed investment return in the annuity table.   

The value of the annuity units is determined as of a valuation date 14 days     
prior to the payment date in order to permit calculation of amounts of annuity  
payouts and mailing of checks in advance of their due dates. Such checks will   
normally be issued and mailed at least three days before the due date.          

Proof of age, sex and survival                                                  
LNY may require proof of age, sex, or survival of any payee upon whose age,     
sex, or survival payments depend.

literature.                                                                     

Additional services                                                             

Dollar-Cost Averaging. (DCA) -- You may systematically transfer on a monthly    
basis, amounts from certain subaccounts, into the variable subaccounts. You may 
elect to participate in the DCA program at the time of application or at        
anytime before the annuity commencement date by completing an election form     
available from us. The minimum amount to be dollar-cost averaged is $10,000.    
DCA transfers can take place over any period between six and 60 months. Once    
elected, the program will remain in effect until the earlier of: (1) the        
annuity commencement date; (2) the value of the amount being DCA'd is depleted; 
or (3) you cancel the program by written request or by telephone if we have     
your telephone authorization on file. Currently, there is no charge for this    
service. However, we reserve the right to impose one. A transfer under this     
program is not considered a transfer for purposes of limiting the number of     
transfers that may be made, or assessing any charges which may apply to         
transfers. We reserve the right to discontinue this program at any time. DCA    
does not assure a profit or protect against loss. Upon receipt of additional    
purchase payments allocated to a DCA program, the length of time of the         
existing program will be extended to reflect the end date of the new DCA        
program. However, the existing interest crediting rate will not be extended.    
The existing interest crediting rate will expire at its originally scheduled    
expiration date and the value remaining in the DCA account from the original    
amount as well as the additional purchase payments will be credited with        
interest at the rate applicable to the new DCA program. If the DCA program is   
in effect, you may not participate in the automatic withdrawal service,         
cross-reinvestment service, or portfolio rebalancing.                           

Automatic Withdrawal Service. (AWS) -- AWS provides an automatic, periodic      
withdrawal of contract value to you. AWS may take place on either a monthly,    
quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis, as selected by the contractowner. You   
may elect to participate in AWS at the time of application or at any time       
before the annuity commencement date by sending a written request to our        
servicing office. The minimum contract value required to establish AWS is       
$10,000. You may cancel or make changes to your AWS program at any time by      
sending a                                                                       

B-6

written request to our servicing office. If telephone authorization has been    
elected, certain changes may be made by telephone. Notwithstanding the          
requirements of the program, any withdrawal must be permitted by Section        
401(a)(9) of the code for qualified plans or permitted under Section 72 for     
non-qualified contracts. To the extent that withdrawals under AWS do            
not qualify for an exemption from the contingent deferred sales charge, we will 
assess any applicable surrender charges on those withdrawals. See Contingent    
deferred sales charges. Currently, there is no charge for this service.         
However, we reserve the right to impose one. We reserve the right to            
discontinue this service at any time. If the AWS program is in effect, you may  
not participate in the DCA program, cross-reinvestment service, or portfolio    
rebalancing.                                                                    

Cross-reinvestment Service. -- Under this option, account value in a designated 
variable subaccount or the fixed side of the contract that exceeds a certain    
baseline amount is automatically transferred to another specific variable       
subaccount(s) or the fixed side of the contract at specific intervals. You may  
elect to participate in cross-reinvestment at the time of application or at any 
time before the annuity commencement date by sending a written request to our   
servicing office or by telephone if we have your telephone authorization on     
file. You designate the holding account, the receiving account(s), and the      
baseline amount. Cross-reinvestment will continue until we receive              
authorization to terminate the program.                                         

The minimum holding account value required to establish cross-reinvestment is   
$10,000 and the minimum amount transferred is $50.00. Currently, there is no    
charge for this service. However, we reserve the right to impose one. A         
transfer under this program is not considered a transfer for purposes of        
limiting the number of transfers that may be made, or assessing any charges     
which may apply to transfers. We reserve the right to discontinue this service  
at any time. This program is not available if you are utilizing an automatic    
deposit feature. Also you may not use the DCA program, the AWS or portfolio     
rebalancing, if you are using this cross-reinvestment service.                  

Portfolio Rebalancing. -- Portfolio rebalancing is an option which, if elected  
by the contractowner, restores to a pre-determined level the percentage of      
contract value allocated to each variable account subaccount (e.g., 20% Money   
Market, 50% Growth, 30% International). This predetermined level will be the    
allocation initially selected when the contract was purchased, unless           
subsequently changed. The portfolio rebalancing allocation may be changed at    
any time by submitting a request to our servicing office.                       

If the portfolio rebalancing is elected, all purchase payments allocated to the 
variable accounts subaccounts must be subject to portfolio rebalancing.         

Portfolio rebalancing may take place on either a monthly, quarterly,            
semi-annual or annual basis, as selected by the contractowner. Once the         
portfolio rebalancing option is activated, any variable account subaccount      
transfers executed outside of the portfolio rebalancing option will terminate   
the portfolio rebalancing option. Any subsequent purchase payment or withdrawal 
that modifies the account balance within each variable subaccount may also      
cause termination of the portfolio rebalancing option. Any such termination     
will be confirmed to the contractowner. The contractowner may terminate the     
portfolio rebalancing option or re-enroll at any time by writing our servicing  
office. If telephone authorization has been elected, the contractowner may make 
these elections by phone.                                                       

The portfolio rebalancing program is not available following the annuity        
commencement date. Currently, there is no charge for this service. However, we  
reserve the right to impose one. This program is not available if you are       
utilizing the DCA program, AWS, or cross-reinvestment service.

mutual funds, managed accounts, institutional investment management and         
financial planning and advisory services.                                       

LNY's customers. Sales literature for the VAA and the series' funds may refer

Due to differences in redemption rates, tax treatment or other considerations,  
the interests of contractowners under the variable life accounts could conflict 
with those of contractowners under the VAA. In those cases, where assets from   
variable life and variable annuity separate accounts are invested in the same   
fund(s) (i.e., where mixed funding occurs), the Boards of Directors of the fund 
involved will monitor for any material conflicts and determine what action, if  
any, should be taken. If it

AFIS is registered as an open-ended management investment company. Investment   
in the Funds are stated at the closing net asset value per share on December
31, 2001, which approximates fair value. The difference between cost and fair   
value is reflected as unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments.  

Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade date-basis. The cost of    
investments sold is determined by the average-cost method.                      

Dividends:                                                                      
Dividends paid to the Variable Account are automatically reinvested in shares   
of the Funds on the payable date. Dividend income is recorded on the            
ex-dividend date.                                                               

Federal Income Taxes:                                                           
Operations of the Variable Account form a part of and are taxed with operations 
of the Company, which is taxed as a "life insurance company" under the Internal 
Revenue Code. The Variable Account will not be taxed as a regulated investment  
company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. Under      
current federal income tax law, no federal income taxes are payable with        
respect to the Variable Account's net investment income and the net realized    
gain on investments.

Reserves on contracts not involving life contingencies are calculated using an  
assumed investment rate of 4%. Reserves on contracts involving life             
contingencies are calculated using a modification of the 1971 Individual        
Annuitant Mortality Table and an assumed investment rate of 4%.

(1)These amounts represent the dividends, excluding distributions of capital    
gains, received by the subaccount from the underlying mutual fund, net of 
management fees assessed by the fund manager, divided by the average net  
assets. These ratios exclude those expenses, such as mortality and expense
charges, that result in direct reductions in the unit values. The         
  recognition of investment income by the subaccount is affected by the timing
of the declaration of dividends by the underlying fund in which the       
subaccounts invest.

Board of Directors of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York                
and                                                                             
Contract Owners of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company Variable Annuity Account H    

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Lincoln 
Life & Annuity Company Variable Annuity Account H ("Variable Account")          
(comprised of the following subaccounts: AFIS Asset Allocation Class II, AFIS   
Blue Chip Income and Growth Class II, AFIS Bond Class II, AFIS Cash Management  
Class II, AFIS Global Discovery Class II, AFIS Global Growth Class II, AFIS     
Global Small Capitalization Class II, AFIS Growth Class II, AFIS Growth-Income  
Class II, AFIS High-Yield Bond Class II, AFIS International Class II, AFIS New  
World Class II and AFIS U.S. Government/AAA-Rated Securities Class II), as of   
December 31, 2001, the related statement of operations for the respective year  
or period then ended, and the statements of changes in net assets for the       
respective year or period then ended, and for the period from June 1, 2000      
(inception) to December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the            
responsibility of the Variable Account's management. Our responsibility is to   
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.           

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally         
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test       
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial         
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of     
December 31, 2001, by correspondence with the custodian. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by      
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.          

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of each of the respective         
subaccounts constituting the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company Variable Annuity    
Account H as of December 31, 2001, the results of their operations for the      
respective year or period then ended, and the changes in their net assets for   
the respective year or period then ended, and the period from June 1, 2000      
(inception) to December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles      
generally accepted in the United States.

Notes to Financial Statements -- Statutory Basis                                

December 31, 2001                                                               

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Organization                                                                    
Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (the "Company") is a wholly-owned    
subsidiary of The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company ("Lincoln Life"),     
which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lincoln National Corporation ("LNC"). In  
1996, the Company was organized under the laws of the State of New York as a    
life insurance company and received approval from the New York Insurance        
Department (the "Department") to operate as a licensed insurance company in the 
State of New York.                                                              

The Company's principal business consists of underwriting annuities and life    
insurance contracts sold through multiple distribution channels. The Company    
conducts business only in the State of New York.                                

Use of Estimates                                                                
The preparation of financial statements of insurance companies requires         
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported   
in the statutory-basis financial statements and accompanying notes. Such        
estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information        
becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.     

Basis of Presentation                                                           
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with     
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Department, which practices 
differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States       
("GAAP"). The more significant variances from GAAP are as follows:              

Investments                                                                   
Bonds are reported at cost or amortized cost or fair value based on their     
National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") rating. For GAAP, the
Company's bonds are classified as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are    
reported at fair value with changes in the fair values reported directly in   
shareholder's equity after adjustments for related amortization of deferred   
acquisition costs, additional policyholder commitments and deferred income    
taxes.                                                                        

Effective January 1, 2001 if it is determined that a decline in the fair value
of a bond is other than temporary, the cost basis of the bond is written down 
to fair value. The provision for such declines is charged to realized loss.   
Impairment is considered to have occurred if it is probable that the Company  
will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms  
of a debt security in effect at the date of acquisition.                      

All mortgage-backed/asset-backed securities (e.g., CMOs) are adjusted for the 
effects of changes in prepayment assumptions on the related accretion of      
discount or amortization of premium of such securities using the retrospective
method. If it is determined that a decline in fair value is other than        
temporary, the cost basis of the security is written down to the undiscounted 
estimated future cash flows. Prior to April 1, 2001 under GAAP, the Company   
accounted for the effects of changes in prepayment assumptions in the same    
manner. Effective April 1, 2001 for GAAP purposes, all securities, purchased  
or retained, that represent beneficial interests in securitized assets, other 
than securitized assets that are of high credit quality securities, are       
adjusted using the prospective method when there is a change in estimated     
future cash flows. If it is determined that a decline in fair value is other  
than temporary, the cost basis of the security is written down to its fair    
value. If high credit quality securities are adjusted, the retrospective      
method is used.                                                               

Under a formula prescribed by the NAIC, the Company defers the portion of     
realized capital gains and losses on sales of fixed income investments,       
principally bonds and mortgage loans, attributable to changes in the general  
level of interest rates and amortizes those deferrals over the remaining      
period to maturity of the individual security sold. The net deferral is       
reported as the interest maintenance reserve ("IMR"). Realized capital gains  
and losses are reported in income net of federal income taxes and transfers to
the IMR. When the net amount deferred is a loss, the IMR is recorded at zero, 
as is the case for the Company at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Under GAAP,     
realized capital gains and losses are reported in net income, on a pre-tax    
basis, in the period that the asset giving rise to the gain or loss is sold.  
Such realized capital gains and losses are reported net of associated         
amortization of deferred acquisition costs and investment expenses, using the 
specific identification method.                                               

The asset valuation reserve ("AVR") provides a valuation allowance for        
invested assets. The AVR is determined by an NAIC prescribed formula, and is  
reported as a liability, with changes reflected directly in unassigned        
surplus. AVR is not recognized for GAAP.                                      

Policy Acquisition Costs                                                      
The costs of acquiring and renewing business are expensed when incurred. Under
GAAP, acquisition costs related to traditional life insurance, to the extent  
recoverable from future policy revenues, are deferred and amortized over the  
premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent    
with those used in computing policy benefit reserves. For universal life      
insurance, annuity and other investment-type products, deferred policy        
acquisition costs, to the extent recoverable from future gross profits, are   
amortized generally in proportion to the present value of expected gross      
profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality, expense margins and 
actual realized gain (loss) on investments.                                   

Nonadmitted Assets                                                            
Certain assets designated as "nonadmitted," principally investment income due 
and accrued past due over 90 days, furniture and equipment, certain           
receivables, and other assets not specifically identified as an admitted asset
within                                                                        

S-6

Notes to Financial Statements -- Statutory Basis (continued)                    

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)      

the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual ("NAIC APPM"--See Note 2),
are excluded from the accompanying balance sheets and are charged directly to 
unassigned surplus. Under GAAP, such assets are included in the balance sheet.

Universal Life and Annuity Policies                                           
Revenues for universal life policies and annuity policies consist of the      
entire premium received. Under GAAP, premiums received in excess of policy    
charges are not recognized as premium revenue. Death benefits paid, policy and
contract withdrawals, and the change in policy reserves on universal life     
policies and annuity policies are reported as benefits and settlement expenses
in the accompanying Statements of Operations. Under GAAP, withdrawals are     
treated as a reduction of the policy or contract liabilities and benefits     
represent the excess of benefits paid over the policy account value and       
interest credited to the account values.                                      

Benefits Reserves                                                             
Certain policy reserves are calculated based on statutorily required interest 
and mortality assumptions rather than on estimated expected experience or     
actual account balances as would be required under GAAP.                      

Reinsurance                                                                   
Premiums, claims and policy benefits and contract liabilities are reported in 
the accompanying financial statements net of reinsurance amounts. For GAAP,   
assets and liabilities related to reinsurance ceded contracts are reported on 
a gross basis.                                                                

A liability for reinsurance balances has been provided for unsecured policy   
reserves and unearned premiums ceded to reinsurers not authorized by the      
Department to assume such business. Changes to those amounts are credited or  
charged directly to unassigned surplus. Under GAAP, an allowance for amounts  
deemed uncollectible is established through a charge to income.               

Commission allowances on business ceded are reported as income when received  
rather than being deferred and amortized with deferred policy acquisition     
costs. Business assumed under 100% indemnity reinsurance agreements is        
accounted for as a purchase for GAAP reporting purposes and the ceding        
commission represents the purchase price. Under purchase accounting, assets   
acquired and liabilities assumed are reported at fair value at the date of the
transaction and the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the amounts  
assigned to assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill
and amortized over future periods, not to exceed 40 years, in accordance with 
benefits expected to be derived from the acquisitions. On a statutory-basis,  
the ceding commission is expensed when paid and reinsurance premiums and      
benefits are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting  
for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.  

Employee Benefits                                                             
For purposes of calculating the Company's pension and postretirement benefit  
obligations, only vested participants and current retirees are included in the
valuation. Under GAAP, active participants not currently eligible also would  
be included.                                                                  

Deferred Income Taxes                                                         
Deferred income taxes are not provided for differences between financial      
statement amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities.                    

Policyholder Dividends                                                        
Policyholder dividends are recognized when declared rather than over the term 
of the related policies.                                                      

Statements of Cash Flow                                                       
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in the Statements of Cash  
Flow Represent cash balances and investments with initial maturities of one   
year or less. Under GAAP, the corresponding captions of cash and cash         
equivalents include cash balances and investments with initial maturities of  
three months or less.                                                         

                                                                           S-7

Other significant accounting practices are as follows:                          

Investments                                                                   
Bonds not backed by loans are principally stated at amortized cost and the    
discount or premium is amortized using the scientific method.                 

Mortgage-backed bonds (e.g., CMO's) are valued at amortized cost and income is
recognized using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments  
and the estimated economic life of the securities. When actual prepayments    
differ significantly from anticipated prepayments, the effective yield is     
recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future        
payments. The net investment in the securities is adjusted to the amount that 
would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the         
acquisition of the securities (i.e., the retrospective method). The Company   
has elected to use actual cost data as of January 1, 1994 as the cost of      
applying the retrospective method to securities purchased prior to that date. 

Short-term investments include investments with maturities of one year or less
at the date of acquisition and are principally stated at amortized cost.      

Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original      
maturities of three months or less, and are principally stated at amortized   
cost.                                                                         

Other investments consist of the Company's ownership interest in a limited    
partnership, which is carried based on the Company's interest in the          
underlying GAAP equity of the partnership. Increases or decreases in the      
carrying value are credited or charged directly to unassigned surplus as      
changes in unrealized gain or loss.                                           

Mortgage loans on real estate are reported at unpaid balances, less allowances
for impairments. A mortgage loan is considered to be impaired, when, based on 
current information and events, it is probable that the Company will          
be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the  
contractual terms of the mortgage agree- ment. The impairment is other than   
temporary when management determines foreclosure is probable. Then, the       
mortgage loan is written down to fair value and a realized loss is recognized.

Policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.                       

Realized capital gains and losses on investments sold are determined using the
specific identification method. Changes in admitted asset carrying amounts of 
bonds and mortgage loans, which result from impairment or premium and discount
amortization are credited or charged to income. Other changes in the admitted 
asset carrying amounts of bonds and mortgage loans are credited or charged    
directly to unassigned surplus.                                               

Premiums                                                                      
Premiums for group tax-qualified annuity business are recognized as revenue   
when deposited. Life insurance and individual annuity premiums are recognized 
as revenue when due.                                                          

Benefit Reserves                                                              
Life, annuity and accident and health benefit reserves are computed in        
accordance with actuarial standards. The reserves are based on actuarial      
assumptions that produce reserves at least as great as those called for in any
contract provision as to reserve basis and method, and are in accordance with 
all other contract provisions. The reserves

are at least as great as the minimum aggregate amounts required by the        
Insurance Department.                                                         

The Company waives deduction of deferred fractional premiums on the death of  
life and annuity policy insureds and returns any premium beyond the date of   
death. Surrender values on policies do not exceed the corresponding benefit   
reserves.                                                                     

Ordinary policies issued substandard are valued on the multiple table reserve 
basis. A reserve of 50% of the net extra premiums is carried on policies with 
flat extra premiums.                                                          

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had $3.9 million and $4.7       
million in reserves, respectively, on $414.5 million and $408.1 million of    
insurance inforce, respectively, on the life line of business for which the   
gross premiums are less than the net premiums according to the standard of    
valuation required by the Department. The Company anticipates investment      
income as a factor in the premium deficiency calculation.                     

Tabular interest, tabular reserves less actual reserves released and tabular  
cost have been determined by formula or from the basic data for such items.   
Tabular interest funds not involving life contingencies has been determined   
using actual interest credited to the funds plus the change in accrued        
interest.                                                                     

Net of reinsurance, liabilities related to deposit-type liabilities, such as  
dividend accumulations, generally are equal to fund balances less applicable  
surrender charges.                                                            

Reinsurance Ceded and Assumed                                                 
Reinsurance premiums, benefits and claims and claim adjustment expenses are   
accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the       
original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.          

Pension Benefits                                                              
Costs associated with the Company's defined benefit pension plans are         
systematically accrued during the expected period of active service of the    
covered employees.                                                            

Income Taxes                                                                  
The Company's federal income tax return is not consolidated with any other    
entities. Beginning in 2002, the Company has elected to file consolidated     
federal income tax returns with LNC and certain LNC subsidiaries.             

Assets Held in Separate Accounts and Liabilities Related to Separate Accounts 
Separate account assets and liabilities reported in the accompanying balance  
sheets represent segregated funds administered and invested for the exclusive 
benefit of variable annuity and universal life contractholders and for which  
the contractholders, rather than the Company, bear the investment risk.       
Separate account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. The       
operations of the separate accounts are not included in the accompanying      
financial statements. Policy administration and investment management fees    
charged on separate account policyholder deposits and mortality charges on    
variable universal life contracts are included in income from surrender, cost 
of insurance, and mortality and expense charges. Fees charged relative to     
variable life and annuity administration agreements for separate account      
products sold by other insurance companies and not recorded on the Company's  
financial statements are included in income from surrender, cost of insurance,
and mortality and expense charges.                                            

Reclassifications                                                             
Certain amounts reported in the prior years' statutory-basis financial        
statements have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in 
the current year. These reclassifications had no effect on unassigned         
surplus-deficit or on net income of the prior years.                          

2. Accounting Change and Permitted Statutory Accounting Practice                
The Company prepares its statutory-based financial statements in conformity     
with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of New York.     
Effective January 1, 2001, the State of New York required that insurance        
companies domiciled in New York prepare their statutory-basis financial         
statements in accordance with the NAIC APPM, as adopted by New York.            

Accounting changes adopted to conform to the provisions of the NAIC APPM, as    
adopted by New York, are reported as changes in accounting principles. The      
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles is reported as an         
adjustment to unassigned surplus in the period of the change. The cumulative    
effect is the difference between the amount of capital and surplus at the       
beginning of the year and the amount of capital and surplus that would have     
been reported at that date if the new accounting principles had been applied    
retroactively for all prior periods. As a result of these changes, the Company  
reported a change of accounting principle, as an adjustment that decreased      
capital and surplus by $1.4 million as of January 1, 2001. Included in this     
total adjustment are the following items:

The Department recognizes only statutory accounting practices prescribed or     
permitted by the State of New York for determining and reporting the financial  
condition and results of operations of an insurance company for determining its 
solvency under the New York Insurance Law. The NAIC APPM, has been adopted as a 
component of prescribed prac-

2. Accounting Change and Permitted Statutory Accounting Practice (continued)    

adopted certain prescribed accounting practices that differ from those found in 
NAIC APPM. The primary differences that affect the Company are the calculation  
of annuity reserves and the reporting of deferred income taxes.                 

The NAIC APPM states that reserves should be calculated using the Commissioners 
Annuity Reserve Valuation Method ("CARVM"), using the "curtate" method. Under   
curtate CARVM, reserves are calculated as the greatest of the present values    
(as of the date of valuation) of the future guaranteed benefits provided by the 
contract at the end of each contract year, less the present value of any future 
net deposit considerations that are required to be paid. The State of New York, 
however, requires reserves to be computed using "continuous" CARVM, which       
utilizes the greatest of the present values of future guaranteed benefits on    
any day (as opposed to the end of each contract year).                          

Continuous CARVM reserves tend to be slightly larger than curtate CARVM         
reserves. If curtate CARVM was applied, future policy benefits and claims and   
other policyholder funds would decrease by $2.2 million, and net transfers due  
from separate accounts would decrease by $1.2 million, at December 31, 2001.    
Surplus would increase by $3.4 million at December 31, 2001, and net income for 
the year ended December 31, 2001 would decrease by $0.3 million.                

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are not included in the balance      
sheet per New York Insurance Law. According to                                  
the NAIC APPM, these amounts should be reported. The Company had unrecorded net 
deferred tax assets of $14.9 million and $19.2 million at December 31, 2001 and 
January 1, 2001, respectively. If these items were recorded, surplus would      
increase by the same amounts at those dates. The Commissioner of Insurance of   
the State of New York has the right to permit other specific practices that     
deviate from practices prescribed by the NAIC APPM.                             

A reconciliation of the Company's capital and surplus and net income as stated  
in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the Department ("New York 
statutory-basis") and as would be stated pursuant strictly to the NAIC APPM, is 
shown below.

The expected maturities may differ from the contractual maturities in the

amount, which had been advanced but not repaid and not included in the mortgage 
loan total. There are no impaired mortgage loans without an allowance for       
credit losses at December 31, 2001 or 2000. At December 31, 2001, the Company's 
recorded investment in impaired securities that have been restructured is $2.0  
million, after writedowns. The total impairment recognized as a realized loss   
during 2001 was $2.1 million.                                                   

All properties covered by mortgage loans have fire insurance at least equal to  
the excess of the loan over the maximum loan that would be allowed on the land  
without the building.

days past due. No accrued investment income was nonadmitted at December 31,
2000.

4. Federal Income Taxes                                                         

Income before federal income taxes differs from the taxable income principally  
due to the use of net operating loss carryforwards in 2001, 2000 and 1999 of    
$16.3 million, $29.3 million and $12.7 million, respectively. The remaining     
portion of the net operating loss at December 31, 2001, of $13.7 million, will  
be available for use to offset taxable income in future years. The net          
operating loss carryforward expires in 2013.                                    

No federal income tax payments were made in 1999. The Company received a refund 
of $3.2 million in 1999 as a result of the utilization of a portion of the net  
operating loss carryforward. The Company made federal income tax payments of    
$1.2 million and $0.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, as a result of    
alternative minimum income tax liabilities. Alternative minimum tax liabilities 
in 2001, 2000 and 1999 of $0.4 million, $0.6 million and $0.2 million,          
respectively, are available for recoupment in the event of future net losses.   

The components of federal income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:          

                                                                [Download Table]

The Company's federal income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount      
obtained by applying the federal statutory rate of 35% to Gain from operations  
before federal income tax (benefit) and net realized loss on investments for    
the following reasons:

5. Reserves and Reinsurance                                                     

The balance sheet caption "Other admitted assets" includes amounts recoverable  
from other insurers for claims paid by the Company of $0.6 million at December
31, 2001. The balance sheet caption, "Future policy benefits and claims" has    
been reduced for insurance ceded by $100.3 million and $87.8 million at         
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.                                       

The caption "Life and annuity premiums" in the Statements of Operations         
includes $116.5 million, $122.9 million and $137.7 million of premiums assumed  
and $31.4 million, $27.0 million and $44.2 million of premiums ceded in 2001,   
2000 and 1999, respectively. The caption "Benefits and settlement expenses" in  
the Statements of Operations is net of reinsurance recoveries of $38.1 million, 
$16.7 million and $71.8 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.          

The Company cedes insurance to other companies, including certain affiliates. A 
portion of risks exceeding the Company's retention limit is reinsured with      
Lincoln Life. The Company limits its maximum coverage that it retains on an     
individual to $0.5 million. The accompanying financial statements reflect       
premiums, benefits and reserves for policy benefits, net of insurance ceded.    
The Company remains liable if its reinsurers are unable to meet their           
contractual obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreements.            

On January 2, 1998, the Company and Lincoln Life entered into an indemnity      
reinsurance transaction whereby the Company and Lincoln Life reinsured 100% of  
a block of individual life insurance and annuity business from CIGNA            
Corporation ("CIGNA"). In 1999, the Company received $5.8 million from CIGNA as 
a result of the final settlement of the statutory-basis values of assets and    
liabilities for the reinsured business. The $5.8 million is included in the     
Statements of Operations line item "Other income."                              

On November 1, 1999, the Company and Lincoln Life reached an agreement to       
retrocede virtually 100% of the disability income business assumed from CIGNA.  
A gain on the transaction of $4.6 million, net of tax, was recorded directly in 
unassigned surplus and is being recognized in statutory earnings over the life  
of the business with $0.5 million and $0.6 million recognized in income in 2001 
and 2000, respectively.                                                         

The regulatory required liability for unsecured reserves ceded to unauthorized  
reinsurers was $0.4 million and $0.5 at December 31, 2001 and 2000,             
respectively. Amounts payable or recoverable for reinsurance on policy and      
contract liabilities are not subject to periodic or maximum limits. At December
31, 2001, the Company's reinsurance recoverables are not material and no        
individual reinsurer owed the Company an amount that was equal to or greater    
than 3% of the Company's surplus.                                               

In 2001 and 2000, the Company did not commute any ceded reinsurance. The        
Company did not record reinsurance credits on existing policies during 2001 as  
a result of new or amended reinsurance agreements.                              

Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates control any non-affiliated        
reinsurers with which they do business. No policies issued by the Company have  
been reinsured with a foreign company, which is controlled, either directly or  
indirectly, by a party not primarily engaged in the business of insurance. The  
Company does not have any reinsurance agreements in effect under which the      
reinsurer may unilaterally cancel the agreement. At December 31, 2001, there    
are no reinsurance agreements in effect such that the amount of losses paid or  
accrued exceed the total direct premium collected.                              

At December 31, 2001, the Company had no uncollectible reinsurance and during   
2001, the Company established no provision for uncollectible reinsurance and    
did not write off any ceded reinsurance balances.                               

                                                                          S-13

6. Capital and Surplus                                                          

Life insurance companies are subject to certain Risk-Based Capital ("RBC")      
requirements as specified by the NAIC. Under those requirements, the amount of  
capital and surplus maintained by a life insurance company is to be determined  
based on the various risk factors related to it. At December 31, 2001, the      
Company exceeds the RBC requirements.                                           

The payment of shareholder dividends by the Company requires 30 day advance     
notice to the Department and requires that the Superintendent of the department 
has not disapproved the dividend within such time.                              

Total assets have been decreased by $2.2 million for non-admitted assets as     
required by statutory guidance.                                                 

7. Employee Benefit Plans                                                       

LNC maintains defined benefit pension plans for its employees (including        
Company employees) and a defined contribution plan for the Company's agents.    
LNC also maintains 401(k) plans, deferred compensation plans and postretirement 
medical and life insurance plans for its employees and agents (including the    
Company's employees and agents). The aggregate expenses and accumulated         
obligations for the Company's portion of these plans are not material to the    
Company's statutory-basis results of operations or financial position for any   
of the periods shown.                                                           

LNC has various incentive plans for employees, agents and directors of LNC and  
its subsidiaries that provide for the issuance of stock options, stock          
appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and stock incentive awards. These  
plans are comprised primarily of stock option incentive plans. Stock options    
awarded under the stock option incentive plans are granted with an exercise     
price equal to the market value of LNC stock at the date of grant and, subject  
to termination of employment, expire ten years from the date of grant. Such     
options are transferable only upon death. Options become exercisable in 25%     
increments over the four-year period following the option grant anniversary     
date. A "reload option" feature was added on May 14, 1997. In most cases,       
persons exercising an option after that date have been granted new options in   
an amount equal to the number of matured shares tendered to exercise the        
original option award. The reload options are granted for the remaining term of 
the related original option and have an exercise price equal to the market      
value of LNC stock at the date of the reload award. Reload options can be       
exercised two years after the grant date if the value of the new option has     
appreciated by at least 25%.

7. Employee Benefit Plans (continued)                                           

As of December 31, 2001, there were 44,709 shares of LNC common stock subject   
to options granted to Company employees under the stock option incentive plans  
of which 19,906 were exercisable on that date. The exercise prices of the       
outstanding options range from $24.72 to $50.83.                                
During 2001, 2000 and 1999, 21,686, 8,235 and 10,201 options became             
exercisable, respectively. During 2001, 14,949 options were exercised and 4,000 
options were forfeited. No options were exercised or forfeited in 2000. During  
1999, 2,066 options were exercised and 1,600 options were forfeited.            

8. Restrictions, Commitments and Contingencies                                  

Marketing and Compliance Matters                                                
Regulators continue to focus on market conduct and compliance issues. Under     
certain circumstances, companies operating in the insurance and financial       
services markets have been held responsible for providing incomplete or         
misleading sales materials and for replacing existing policies with policies    
that were less advantageous to the policyholder. The Company's management       
continues to monitor the Company's sales materials and compliance procedures    
and is making an extensive effort to minimize any potential liability. Due to   
the uncertainty surrounding such matters, it is not possible to provide a       
meaningful estimate of the range of potential outcomes at this time; however,   
it is management's opinion that such future development will not materially     
affect the financial position of the Company.                                   

Vulnerability from Concentrations                                               
At December 31, 2001, the Company did not have a material concentration of      
financial instruments in a single investee or industry. The Company's           
investments in mortgage loans principally involve commercial real estate. At    
December 31, 2001, 30% of such mortgages, or $45.8 million, involved properties 
located in New York and California. Such investments consist of first mortgage  
liens on completed income-producing properties and the mortgage outstanding on  
any individual property does not exceed $6.7 million.                           

At December 31, 2001, the Company did not have a concentration of: 1) business  
transactions with a particular customer, lender or distributor; 2) revenues     
from a particular product or service; 3) sources of supply of labor or services 
used in the business or 4) a market or geographic area in which business is     
conducted that makes it vulnerable to an event that is at least reasonably      
possible to occur in the near term and which could cause a severe impact to the 
Company's financial condition.                                                  

Contingency Matters                                                             
The Company is occasionally involved in various pending or threatened legal     
proceedings arising from the conduct of business. Most of these proceedings are 
routine in the ordinary course of business. The Company maintains professional  
liability insurance coverage for certain claims in excess of $10 million. The   
degree of applicability of this coverage will depend on the specific facts of   
each proceeding. In some instances, these proceedings include claims for        
unspecified or substantial punitive damages and similar types of relief in      
addition to amounts for alleged contractual liability or requests for equitable 
relief. After consultation with legal counsel and a review of available facts,  
it is management's opinion that these proceedings ultimately will be resolved   
without materially affecting the financial position of the Company.             

State guaranty funds assess insurance companies to cover losses to              
policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated companies. Mandatory assessments    
may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes. The     
Company has accrued for expected assessments net of estimated future premium    
tax deductions.                                                                 

9. Fair Value of Financial Instruments                                          

The following methodologies and assumptions were used to determine the          
estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments. Considerable      
judgment is required to develop these fair values. Accordingly, the estimates   
shown are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a 
one-time, current market exchange of the Company's financial instruments.       

Bonds                                                                           
Fair values of bonds are based on quoted market prices, where available. For    
bonds not actively traded, fair values are estimated using values obtained from 
independent pricing services. In the case of private placements, fair values    
are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a current market  
rate applicable to the coupon rate, credit quality and maturity of the          
investments.                                                                    

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate                                                   
The estimated fair values of mortgage loans on real estate are established      
using a discounted cash flow method based on credit rating, maturity and future 
income. The rating for mortgages in good standing are based on property type,   
location, market conditions, occupancy, debt service coverage, loan to value,   
caliber of tenancy, borrower and payment record. Fair values for impaired       
mortgage loans are based on: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows 
discounted at the loan's effective interest rate; 2) the loan's market prices   
or 3) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.     

                                                                          S-15

Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York                                      

Notes to Financial Statements -- Statutory Basis (continued)                    

9. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)                              

Policy Loans                                                                    
The estimated fair value of investments in policy loans was calculated on a     
composite discounted cash flow basis using Treasury interest rates consistent   
with the maturity durations assumed. These durations were based on historical   
experience.                                                                     

Other Investments and Cash and Short-Term Investments                           
The carrying value for assets classified as other investments, cash and cash    
equivalents and short-term investments in the accompanying statutory-basis      
balance sheets approximate their fair value.                                    

Investment-type Insurance Contracts                                             
The balance sheet caption, "Future policy benefits and claims" includes         
contracts that are considered to be investment-type contracts for GAAP purposes 
(i.e., certain annuity contracts). The fair values for the majority of these    
contracts are based on their approximate surrender values.                      

The remainder of the balance sheet caption "Future policy benefits and claims"  
that do not fit the definition of "investment-type insurance contracts" for     
GAAP are considered insurance contracts. Fair value disclosures are not         
required for these insurance contracts and fair values have not been determined 
by the Company. It is the Company's position that the disclosure of the fair    
value of these insurance contracts is important because readers of these        
financial statements could draw inappropriate conclusions about the Company's   
capital and surplus determined on a fair value basis. It could be misleading if 
only the fair value of assets and liabilities defined as financial instruments  
are disclosed. The Company and other companies in the insurance industry are    
monitoring the related actions of the various rule-making bodies and attempting 
to determine an appropriate methodology for estimating and disclosing the "fair 
value" of their insurance contract liabilities.                                 

Separate Accounts                                                               
Assets held in separate accounts are reported in the accompanying               
statutory-basis balance sheets at fair value. The related liabilities are also  
reported at fair value in amounts equal to the separate account assets. Seed    
money deposited into the separate accounts by the Company is included as a      
separate account asset, but not as a separate account liability.                

The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company's financial        
instruments are as follows:

Notes to Financial Statements -- Statutory Basis (continued)                    

11. Separate Accounts                                                           

Separate account assets held by the Company consist primarily of mutual funds,  
long-term bonds, common stocks and short-term investments and are carried at    
fair value. None of the separate accounts have any minimum income guarantees    
and the investment risks associated with market value changes are borne         
entirely by the policyholder.                                                   

Separate account premiums, deposits and other considerations amounted to $114.2 
million, $61.6 million and $109.6 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 
Reserves for separate accounts with assets at fair value were $341.2 million    
and $317.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. All reserves    
are subject to discretionary withdrawal at market value.                        
A reconciliation of transfers to the Company from the separate accounts is as   
follows:

Report of Independent Auditors                                                  

Board of Directors                                                              
Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York                                      

We have audited the accompanying statutory-basis balance sheets of Lincoln Life 
& Annuity Company of New York (a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Lincoln   
National Corporation) as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related         
statutory-basis statements of operations, changes in capital and surplus and    
cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.    
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits.                                                                  

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally         
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test       
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial         
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall     
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a          
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company presents its    
financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or      
permitted by the New York Insurance Department, which practices differ from     
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The variances    
between such practices and accounting principles generally accepted in the      
United States and the effects on the accompanying financial statements are also 
described in Note 1.                                                            

In our opinion, because of the effects of the matter described in the preceding 
paragraph, the financial statements referred to above do not present fairly, in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,  
the financial position of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York at         
December 31, 2001 and 2000, or the results of its operations or its cash flow   
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.              

However, in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present     
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lincoln Life &      
Annuity Company of New York at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of   
its operations and its cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or        
permitted by the New York Insurance Department.                                 

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed 
various accounting policies to be in accordance with the revised NAIC           
Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, as adopted by the New York          
Insurance Department.

INDEMNIFICATION--UNDERTAKING  

(a)  Brief description of indemnification provisions.                           

In general, Article VII, Section 2, of the By-Laws of Lincoln Life &  
  Annuity Co. of NY (LNY) provides that LNY will indemnify certain persons
   against expenses, judgments and certain other specified costs incurred by
 any such person if he/she is made a party or is threatened to be made a
  party to a suit or proceeding because he/she was a director, officer, or
employee of LNY, as long as he/she acted in good faith and in a manner
   he/she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of, or not opposed
to the best interests of, LNY. Certain additional conditions apply to 
indemnification in criminal proceedings.                              

 In particular, separate conditions govern indemnification of directors,
officers, and employees of LNY in connection with suits by, or in the 
rights of LNY.                                                        

Please refer to Article VII of the By-Laws of LNY (Exhibit No. 6(a)   
hereto) for the full text of the indemnification provisions.          
 Indemnification is permitted by, and is subject to the requirements of,
New York law.                                                         

(b)  Undertaking pursuant to Rule 484 of Regulation C under the Securities Act  
of 1933:                                                              

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
    of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of
    the Registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item 28(a) above or
otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the 
   Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,unenforceable. In the
     event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than
   the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director,
    officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense
of any such action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, 
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being 
   registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
     appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
   against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the
final adjudication of such issue.

What Is an Annuity?
Simply stated, an annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company in which you pay a sum of money, either in a lump sum or through periodic contributions, and in return receive regular payments for life or for a stated period of time.
The money grows on a tax-deferred basis until you begin receiving it, typically after age 59 1/2. Annuities are especially appealing during your retirement years because they help offer protection against outliving your assets.
Annuities are often confused with life insurance, but they are not the same. Once an annuity is converted into payments (annuitized), it can provide a steady stream of income while you are alive; a life insurance policy pays off upon your death and benefits your heirs.
Annuities differ from CDs and government bonds as well, since they are not federally insured or guaranteed. With an annuity, you must depend on the financial strength of the insurance company. Insurance company financial strength is rated by various service companies such as A.M. Best or Moody's. You may want to consider only those insurance companies that carry an A or A+ rating.
There are two basic types of annuities: fixed and variable.
Fixed Annuities
Fixed annuities can pay a fixed rate of interest for a certain period, usually one to five years. After the guarantee period is over, your assets are automatically rolled over for a new time period at a new rate. The new rate will have moved up or down, depending on the general direction of interest rates. Most fixed annuities have a "floor" or guarantee below which your return will not drop. This floor, often tied to the Treasury bill rate or other index, lasts the life of the annuity.
In general, a fixed annuity is characterized by:

Tax-deferred fixed interest rates during the accumulation (growth) phase.
Fixed payments during the income (distribution) phase.
Return of principal (the amount you invested) guaranteed by the insurance company. The ability for the insurance company to meet these obligations to policyholders are subject to sufficient capital, liquidity, cash flow and other resources of the insurance company.
Risk/return: Fixed annuities generally offer a lower return than variable annuities, but also carry a lower level of risk.

There are several hybrids of fixed annuities to choose from including the Market Value Adjusted Annuity (MVA), the Single Premium Deferred Annuity (SPDA), the CD-type annuity and the Fixed Index Annuity.
Variable Annuities
Variable annuities are essentially an insurance contract combined with an investment product. Through a professionally managed "subaccount" (similar to a mutual fund portfolio) within your variable annuity, you invest in stocks, bonds or money market funds or a combination thereof.
Depending on market fluctuations, the performance of these investments will vary, hence leading to a variable return on the annuity. The insurance company does not guarantee a specified rate of return, nor does it guarantee a return of the principal. Your return could potentially be higher than a fixed annuity, but your risk is higher too.
In general, a variable annuity is characterized by:

Variable rates of return during the accumulation (growth) phase
Principal not guaranteed by the insurance company
Payments that vary depending on the performance of the underlying investment option(s)
Death benefit: Most variable annuities provide a guaranteed death benefit. This assures that the owner's heirs will receive at least the sum of all premiums paid less any withdrawals. More liberal guaranteed death benefits may be available.

An added risk protection is that variable annuity assets are held in a separate account of the insurance company. Thus, the assets are more protected from the claims of the insurance company's creditors.
The separate account of a variable annuity is not a mutual fund. While separate accounts may have a name similar to a mutual fund, it is not the same pool of funds and will experience different performance than the mutual fund of the same or similar name. In addition the financial ratings of the issuing insurance company do not apply to any non-guaranteed separate accounts. The value of the separate accounts that are not guaranteed will fluctuate in response to the market changes and other factors.

  At a Glance: Fixed vs. Variable Annuities

Investment Options
None
Investor has multiple choices


Investment Risk

Investor is at risk


Where assets held
Insurance company general account
Insurance company separate account so less exposure to company's creditors 



Accessing Your Annuity
For most tax types, it is more advantageous not to take payments from an annuity until the age of 59 1/2, There are several ways your money can be returned to you:

Lump sum
Regular monthly payments for a specified period of time or
Lifetime income for you and your spouse

Annuity payments vary depending on:

Amount you have contributed
Your age
Length of time your money has been compounding
Rate of return on the portfolios

If you don't need the income stream your annuity can provide, it can pass to your beneficiaries outside the probate process (although the proceeds will be taxable to them).
Penalties and Surrender Charges
Taking payments from your annuity before age 59 1/2 can be expensive since the IRS imposes a 10% penalty on the monies withdrawn in most cases.
Due to the 10% IRS penalty for money taken out before you reach age 59 1/2, most insurance companies allow you to withdraw up to 10% of your assets before they impose a surrender charge.
The combination of surrender charges and a possible 10% penalty means that you may want to view an annuity as a long-term investment.

1Assumes the policy is funded as specified. To maintain the guaranteed death benefit protection, automatic rebalancing is required and the use of the money market investment option is limited to the right-to-examine period, or as an account from which to transfer funds for the dollar cost averaging (DCA) program.



2Our Premium Reserve Rider give you access to any potential cash value, above a predetermined threshold without impacting the guaranteed benefit. The Premium Reserve Rider is included where available, and is subject to certain fees and account credits.



3Distributions are taken through loans and withdrawals which reduce your policy’s cash surrender value and death benefit and may cause the policy to lapse.  Loans are not considered income and are tax free. Withdrawals and surrenders are tax-free up to your cost basis, provided your policy is not a modified endowment contract (MEC). A MEC policy is one in which the life insurance limits exceed certain high levels of premium, or the cumulative premium payments exceed certain amounts specified under the Internal Revenue Code. For policies that are MECs, distributions during the life of the insured, including loans, are first treated as taxable to the extent of income in the contract, and an additional 10% federal income tax may apply for withdrawals made prior to age 59½.
