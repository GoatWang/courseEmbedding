This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) said today it has 
      named Robert F. Probst as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial 
      Officer. Probst will assume his position in October and work with 
      retiring Ventas CFO Richard A. Schweinhart through the transition. In 
      his position, Probst will be a member of the Ventas executive leadership 
      team, reporting to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro.
    


      “Bob is a seasoned, successful executive who will be a key partner in 
      our executive ranks as we continue to elevate Ventas as a leading S&P 
      500 company and global REIT; we are delighted he is joining Ventas,” 
      Cafaro said. “With nearly 25 years of experience in finance and capital 
      markets within multiple industries, Bob has overseen significant 
      shareholder value creation through efficiency, strategy and mergers and 
      acquisitions. He will add meaningful international depth to the Ventas 
      team, while also sharing our values of integrity and collaboration. Bob 
      will be a leader within the Company as we continue to drive growth, 
      shareholder value and excellence at Ventas.”
    

      Probst, who will be based in the Company’s Chicago headquarters office, 
      will have responsibility for accounting, treasury, capital markets and 
      information technology functions.
    

      Probst, 46, served as senior vice president and chief financial officer 
      for Beam Inc. from 2008 to 2014. He was a key player in establishing the 
      former unit of Fortune Brands as a standalone publicly traded spirits 
      company in 2011. Probst was Beam’s chief financial officer from its 
      inception as an independent, S&P 500 company to its $16 billion sale to 
      Suntory Holdings Limited earlier this year. During his tenure at Beam, 
      Probst played a key role in the transformation of the company to a 
      consistent outperformer with a clear growth strategy, focused execution, 
      entrepreneurial culture and top talent. His responsibilities at Beam 
      included finance, IT, strategy, M&A, and investor relations.
    

      From 2005 to 2008, Probst was vice president of finance, strategy and 
      M&A for Baxter International Inc.’s $4 billion Medication Delivery 
      business. Prior to that, he was with London-based Diageo plc, a global 
      premium drinks business, from 1997 to 2005. In his last position as CFO 
      – Global Supply Chain, he was responsible for financial operations for 
      the end-to-end manufacturing value chain from procurement through 
      distribution globally. Earlier in his career, he was a finance manager 
      for The Pillsbury Company and a commercial lending officer with the 
      Northern Trust Bank.
    

      Probst earned his B.A. with honors in Economics from Duke University in 
      1990, where he was a member of the 1986 NCAA national championship men’s 
      soccer team. He received his M.B.A. with highest honors in Finance and 
      Accounting from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 
      1993. Probst serves on the boards of the Chicago Botanic Garden and Camp 
      Kesem, as well as the advisory board of the Duke University Financial 
      Economics program.
    

      Ventas, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a leading real estate investment 
      trust. Its diverse portfolio of more than 1,500 assets in the United 
      States, Canada and the United Kingdom consists of seniors housing

      Probst, 46, served as senior vice president and chief financial officer 
      for Beam Inc. from 2008 to 2014. He was a key player in establishing the 
      former unit of Fortune Brands as a standalone publicly traded spirits 
      company in 2011. Probst was Beam’s chief financial officer from its 
      inception as an independent, S&P 500 company to its $16 billion sale to 
      Suntory Holdings Limited earlier this year. During his tenure at Beam, 
      Probst played a key role in the transformation of the company to a 
      consistent outperformer with a clear growth strategy, focused execution, 
      entrepreneurial culture and top talent. His responsibilities at Beam 
      included finance, IT, strategy, M&A, and investor relations.
    

      From 2005 to 2008, Probst was vice president of finance, strategy and 
      M&A for Baxter International Inc.’s $4 billion Medication Delivery 
      business. Prior to that, he was with London-based Diageo plc, a global 
      premium drinks business, from 1997 to 2005. In his last position as CFO 
      – Global Supply Chain, he was responsible for financial operations for 
      the end-to-end manufacturing value chain from procurement through 
      distribution globally. Earlier in his career, he was a finance manager 
      for The Pillsbury Company and a commercial lending officer with the 
      Northern Trust Bank.
    

      Probst earned his B.A. with honors in Economics from Duke University in 
      1990, where he was a member of the 1986 NCAA national championship men’s 
      soccer team. He received his M.B.A. with highest honors in Finance and 
      Accounting from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 
      1993. Probst serves on the boards of the Chicago Botanic Garden and Camp 
      Kesem, as well as the advisory board of the Duke University Financial 
      Economics program.
