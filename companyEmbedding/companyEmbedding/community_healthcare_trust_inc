Cash Dividend On The Way From Community Healthcare Trust (CHCT)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 5/17/17, Community Healthcare Trust Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.39, payable on 6/2/17.

Community Healthcare Trust Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 6.49% Yield (CHCT)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

CHCT: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 09/15/2016 settlement date, and Community Healthcare Trust Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 6.72 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.85. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS

 














Community Healthcare Trust is investing in non-urban healthcare real estate where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers that offer high quality healthcare services in sustainable non-urban markets. We are investing in properties that are integral to providing need based healthcare services to a stable or growing population base.
 
We believe healthcare providers will need to invest a significant amount of capital in non-urban areas over the next several decades in order to:
 

provide lower cost healthcare in the patients’ local communities than they can by transporting the non-urban population to high cost urban centers, and

 

ramp up their services as there are natural population increases in the non urban areas and as the Affordable Care Act brings more of the non-urban population base into some type of insurance coverage.

 
Our goal is to develop relationships with these healthcare providers and invest, with them, in their local communities.
 
Tenants of our properties include many nationally recognized healthcare providers (or their affiliates), such as Adventist, HCA, Fresenius, and AmSurg.

Our investment portfolio is widely diversified among healthcare facility type and segments such as ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral facilities, dialysis clinics, medical office buildings, oncology centers, and physician clinics, as well as being diverse both geographically and with respect to our tenant base.

INVESTOR RELATIONS

 














Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles — relationship investing, portfolio diversification and conservative balance sheet management.

 




Relationship Investing

 




We generate relationships and make investment decisions that are expected to increase shareholder value by driving profitable growth. We attempt to develop relationships that create situations that allow us to meet our goals and investment criteria. We acquire and lease properties to healthcare providers.


 




Portfolio Diversification

 




We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment, geography and operator. Diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business. It allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics.

 




While pursuing our strategy of diversification, we monitor our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type, geographic location, or the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator. With investments in multiple segments geographic locations and multiple operators, we can focus on opportunities with the best risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole.

 




Conservative Balance Sheet

 




A conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our business strategy. We continuously strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet. We will actively manage our debt-to-equity levels and maintain multiple sources of liquidity – such as a revolving line of credit and access to capital markets & secured debt lenders. We will attempt to match the duration of our investments with long term financing.

 





We structure transactions as master leases, require operator insurance and indemnifications, obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk. We will finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize a revolving line of credit or arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We will arrange for longer-term financing through offerings of equity and debt securities.

INVESTOR RELATIONS

 














Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles — relationship investing, portfolio diversification and conservative balance sheet management.

 




Relationship Investing

 




We generate relationships and make investment decisions that are expected to increase shareholder value by driving profitable growth. We attempt to develop relationships that create situations that allow us to meet our goals and investment criteria. We acquire and lease properties to healthcare providers.


 




Portfolio Diversification

 




We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment, geography and operator. Diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business. It allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics.

 




While pursuing our strategy of diversification, we monitor our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type, geographic location, or the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator. With investments in multiple segments geographic locations and multiple operators, we can focus on opportunities with the best risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole.

 




Conservative Balance Sheet

 




A conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our business strategy. We continuously strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet. We will actively manage our debt-to-equity levels and maintain multiple sources of liquidity – such as a revolving line of credit and access to capital markets & secured debt lenders. We will attempt to match the duration of our investments with long term financing.

 





We structure transactions as master leases, require operator insurance and indemnifications, obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk. We will finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize a revolving line of credit or arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We will arrange for longer-term financing through offerings of equity and debt securities.

Our primary strategies to achieve our business objective are to invest in, own and proactively manage a diversified portfolio of healthcare properties, which we believe will drive reliable, increasing rental revenue and cash flow.

 
Growth Strategies
 
We intend to continue to grow our portfolio of healthcare properties primarily through acquisitions of non-Urban healthcare facilities that provide stable revenue growth and predictable long-term cash flows. We generally focus on individual acquisition opportunities of $10 million or less in off-market or lightly marketed transactions and do not intend to participate in competitive bidding or auctions of properties. We believe that there are abundant opportunities to acquire attractive healthcare properties in our target markets either from third-party owners of existing healthcare facilities or directly with healthcare providers through sale-leaseback transactions. We believe there is significantly less competition for these Non-Urban assets from existing REITs and institutional buyers than for comparable assets in urban areas, thereby increasing the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, we may acquire healthcare properties on a non-cash basis in a tax efficient manner through the issuance of OP units as consideration for the transaction.
 
We intend for our investment portfolio to be diversified among healthcare facility type and segments such as ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral facilities, dialysis clinics, medical office buildings, oncology centers, physician clinics, acute care hospitals, assisted living facilities, post-acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and specialty hospitals, as well as being diverse both geographically and with respect to our tenant base. We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers that offer need-based healthcare services in our target markets.

WELCOME TO COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE TRUST

 














Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated is a self-managed, fully-integrated healthcare real estate company that acquires, owns or finances real estate properties that are leased to hospitals, doctors, healthcare systems or other healthcare service providers located in geographic areas primarily outside of urban centers. As a result of favorable demographic trends affecting the healthcare industry, continuing increases in healthcare spending and the continuing shift in the delivery of healthcare services to community-based outpatient facilities, we believe our properties are essential for healthcare providers to serve their local markets.

 




Our management team has significant healthcare, real estate and public real estate investment trust, or REIT, experience and has long-established relationships with a wide range of healthcare providers, which we believe provide us a competitive advantage in sourcing growth opportunities that produce attractive risk-adjusted returns.

After deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and estimated expenses
of this offering payable by us, we expect to receive net proceeds from this 
offering and the concurrent private placements of approximately $111,023,296 
(or approximately $127,588,921 if the underwriters' option to purchase 
additional shares is exercised in full).

We will contribute the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent 
private placements to our operating partnership. Our operating partnership 
intends to use the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placements as follows:

. approximately $114.5 million to acquire the Initial Properties;

. the balance, if any, for general corporate and working capital purposes, 
  including payment of expenses associated with this offering, the acquisition 
  of the Initial Properties and possible future acquisitions and development
  activities.

Pending application of net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placements, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing accounts, 
money market accounts and interest-bearing securities in a manner that is 
consistent with our intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Such 
investments may include, for example, government and government agency 
certificates, government bonds, certificates of deposit, interest-bearing bank
deposits, money market accounts and mortgage loan participations.


We compete for property acquisitions with other investors, healthcare providers,
other healthcare related REITs, real estate partnerships and financial 
institutions. The operation of all of our properties, including the Initial 
Properties, will be subject to competition from similar properties. Certain 
tenants of other properties may have greater capital resources than we do. In 
addition, the extent to which the Initial Properties are utilized depends upon 
several factors, including the number of physicians using, or referring patients
to, the healthcare facilities leasing the Initial Properties, competitive 
systems of healthcare delivery, and the area population, size and composition. 
Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and 
regulations may also have a significant effect on the utilization of the 
properties. Virtually all of the Initial Properties operate in a competitive 
environment and patients and referral sources, including physicians, may change
their preferences for a healthcare facility from time to time.


Company Description
We are a fully-integrated healthcare real estate company that was recently 
organized as a Maryland corporation to acquire and own properties that are
leased to hospitals, doctors, healthcare systems or other healthcare service
providers in Non-Urban markets. Our strategic focus is to invest in


 real estate
that is diversified across healthcare provider, geography, facility type and
industry segment. We believe that favorable demographic trends, continuing
increases in healthcare spending and the continuing shift in the delivery of
healthcare services to community-based outpatient facilities create attractive
opportunities for us. We intend to focus on Non-Urban healthcare facilities
because we believe these properties are essential to healthcare providers in
their local markets and can generate more attractive risk-adjusted returns than
similar facilities in urban markets. In addition, we believe our management
team's extensive relationships with healthcare providers and owners of
healthcare facilities will provide us with the opportunity to acquire attractive
Non-Urban healthcare facilities outside of a competitive bidding process.
Furthermore, we believe there is significantly less competition from existing
REITs and institutional buyers for these Non-Urban assets.

Upon completion of this offering and the acquisition of our Initial Properties,
we will own 35 properties comprised of an aggregate of approximately 623,000 
leasable square feet located in 18 states. Our Initial Properties are leased by
healthcare providers across a diverse range of both facility types and 
healthcare industry segments, including ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral
facilities, dialysis clinics, medical office buildings, oncology centers, and
physician clinics. As of March 31, 2015, the Initial Properties were
approximately 94% leased to 69 separate tenants. We believe our staggered lease
maturity schedule and active asset management will optimize the value of our
portfolio by consistently achieving market rental rates in new leases when the
existing leases expire.

Substantially all of our revenues will be derived from net leases pursuant to 
which our tenants are generally responsible for substantially all of the 
operating expenses relating to the property, including real estate taxes, 
utilities, property insurance, routine maintenance and repairs and property
management. We believe this net lease structure helps insulate us from increases
in certain operating expenses and provides more predictable cash flow. The
leases for our Initial Properties typically include rent escalation provisions
designed to provide us with annual growth in our rental revenues. Tenants of our
Initial Properties include many nationally recognized healthcare providers (or
their affiliates), such as Adventist HealthCare, Inc., or Adventist, Hospital
Corporation of America, or HCA, Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co., KGaA, or
Fresenius, and AmSurg Corp., or AmSurg. Through these property investments and
corresponding operating income, we seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted
returns for our stockholders through a combination of stable and increasing
dividends and potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties
and the value of our shares of common stock.

We were formed as a Maryland corporation on March 28, 2014. Our corporate
offices are located at 354 Cool Springs Blvd, Suite 106, Franklin, TN 37067. Our
