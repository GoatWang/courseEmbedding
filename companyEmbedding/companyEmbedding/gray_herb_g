                        Excellent coverage of grey
                    

                            Posted by Reviewer2324933 on Jul 14, 2013
                    


                            This is not an easy to use product, but it really did a nice job of covering the grey in the front of my hair.  I had been using Surya and really loved the look and the ease of application, but it began to take on a pink tone, probably as my grey hair increased.  Naturally, it's all in the front.  This product did a nice job of covering it without making it look pink, but it is not that easy to apply.  I let the mixtures sit for 3 hours as one of the methods advised and the product was hard when it was time to apply.  I think adding a little water right before application might make application easier and still give good color.  I have re-ordered this product and am happy with the results, but it is not an easy product to apply.  It is in powder form and must be mixed to use.

                            I was so excited to try this all natural color/conditioner, but... it was horrible to work with!  I have to condition my hair much more now.  Had to wash my hair twice after coloring to get the grit and 'muddy' look out of it.  I'm very disappointed in this product.  You really do need a paintbrush to apply this; and you would definitely need two people!

Excellent coverage of grey

This is not an easy to use product, but it really did a nice job of covering the grey in the front of my hair.  I had been using Surya and really loved the look and the ease of application, but it began to take on a pink tone, probably as my grey hair increased.  Naturally, it's all in the front.  This product did a nice job of covering it without making it look pink, but it is not that easy to apply.  I let the mixtures sit for 3 hours as one of the methods advised and the product was hard when it was time to apply.  I think adding a little water right before application might make application easier and still give good color.  I have re-ordered this product and am happy with the results, but it is not an easy product to apply.  It is in powder form and must be mixed to use.

Use lemon juice and have patience

This henna is excellent and very effective, especially for grays!  Don't listen to those comments with no patience or intelligence to read the directions...it will take a long time, so nuture yourself for a few hours and enjoy fantastic color...with no toxic chemicals.  As you use henna your hair will become darker over a few days, IF you use LEMON JUICE or another acidic such as vinegar.  Lemons smell better...Ginger or clove will reduce the odor of henna if you don't like the smell.  Do an internet search for henna use information if you're truly interested in nourishing yourself and your hair, instead of using a quick toxic fix.

Lasted 4 weeks, the chestnut variety seemed to last longer. Tried putting essence of lavender in to reduce the "swamp gunk" smell, and it worked beautifully.  Am going to try the next lighter color next time.

Light Mountain Mahogany

If you are like me and concerned about the carcinogenic effects of using hair color this is a good alternative.  It is a two-step process and you have to allow time for the henna to cure so it takes a little more time than regular coloring—so plan accordingly. I did not have all the chemical residue from the last coloring out of my hair so the color came out with more gold tones that mahogany but still a nice color.  I got good grey hair coverage and my hair felt soft and conditioned, not brittle and dried out like with regular hair color.

Color the grey. This product is amazing. I developed a nasty allergy to chemical hair dyes . This product hs saved my sanity. First of all it's easy and simple to order. Delivery is super fast. Instructions supplied are clearly written. Did a test patch as instructed then proceeded to apply. It mixes easy and coats hair beautifully.  Four hours later ...super shiny,glossy hair. The colour!. Wow!. It covered every single grey hair. It has reduced the frizz on my curly hair and it remains,four weeks later, so soft. Many thanks. Will not use another brand again!. X

Appreciate that this item is USDA Organic and contains 100% pure botanical hair color. I like that this is ammonia and peroxide free. You get a complete application kit in this complete all natural hair color and conditioning program. This mahogany color contains only pure botanicals and nothing else!

Natural Hair Color

I have really liked the color change after using this product. My hair veers towards red (even without hear) so this came out a little dark red, but I loved it. The only things I will say I didn't like are the fact that it was very messy actually coloring it, and the gritty consistency took a while to wash all the way out. Also, the color bleeds a little each time you wash, so beware of using white towels at all while your hair is color with this. Even several weeks later. Overall though, I love the color. Thanks!

A number of natural remedies are said to reverse or stop graying hair, a problem commonly associated with the aging process. Although there's no scientific support for the claims that these remedies can fight gray hair, it's possible that certain lifestyle practices may affect changes in your hair coloring.Why Does Your Hair Turn Gray?For help in making sense of the remedies used to reverse or stop gray hair, it's important to understand why hair turns gray in the first place.









Each of our hair follicles contains pigment cells known as melanocytes. Melanocytes are responsible for producing melanin, which is a chemical that gives hair its color.As we get older, activity in melanocytes slows down until the cells stop making pigment. Once melanin is no longer produced, new hairs grow in without pigment and are gray, white, or silver in color.Natural Remedies for Gray HairThe following remedies are often said to reverse or stop the graying of hair:barley grassblack seed oilblack teacoconut oilcurry leavesonion juiceDespite claims for their effectiveness, there's no scientific evidence showing that these remedies can keep you from going gray or return gray hair to its original color.Traditional Chinese MedicineAccording to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), prematurely gray hair signals an underlying health issue. Practitioners of TCM suggest that hair reflects the quality of blood and the strength of the kidneys.



A variety of natural substances are used to strengthen the blood and kidneys in TCM. These substances include:chlorophyllhijikiblackstrap molassesblack sesame seedsnettleswheatgrassAvoiding excessive consumption of meat, dairy, and salt is also said to benefit the blood and kidneys.In addition, an herb called Fo-Ti is sometimes used by TCM practitioners to restore hair's natural color, however it has been associated with serious adverse effects.









 Here is more information about the potential benefits and possible health risks associated with use of Fo-Ti.Ayurvedic MedicineIn ayurveda (a form of alternative medicine that originated in India), premature graying is believed to be linked to imbalances in the pitta or vata dosha. Ayurvedic practitioners use several remedies to treat gray hair, including bhringaraj oil and amla oil.Are Health Conditions Linked With Gray Hair?In most cases, the onset of gray hair is determined by genetics. However, certain conditions may cause hair to turn gray more quickly than normal. These conditions include thyroid disorders (such as Grave's disease, Hashimoto's disease, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism), vitiligo, and early menopause.1) Vitamin B12 Deficiency AnemiaA condition known as vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is also linked to the premature graying of hair. In some cases, this condition results from diets lacking in vitamin B12 (a nutrient found mainly in meat, eggs, and milk).Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia can also occur when the stomach is unable to absorb vitamin B12. This inability may be due to issues such as surgery involving the stomach or small intestine (including gastric bypass surgery) or diseases affecting the small intestine (including Crohn's disease and celiac disease).









2) SmokingSome research indicates that smoking cigarettes may be associated with premature graying of hair.Several studies have shown that alternative therapies such as acupuncture and hypnosis may be helpful to people who are attempting to quit smoking.Related: Natural anti-smoking aids3) ObesityIn a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in 2015, scientists observed that obese people may face an increased risk of early onset of gray hair. You can learn about natural approaches to obesity prevention and alternative strategies for weight maintenance here.4) Oxidative Stress
Emerging research suggests that oxidative stress may play a role in the premature graying of hair. It's thought that oxidative stress may contribute to the graying of hair by promoting the breakdown of melanocytes.Following a diet high in antioxidants may help protect against the damaging effects of oxidative stress. While there's no evidence that it can reverse or stop the graying of hair, boosting your intake of antioxidant-rich foods may be beneficial to your overall health.SourcesShin H, Ryu HH, Yoon J, Jo S, Jang S, Choi M, Kwon O, Jo SJ. “Association of premature hair graying with family history, smoking, and obesity: a cross-sectional study.” J Am Acad Dermatol. 2015 Feb;72(2):321-7.Trüeb RM1. “Oxidative stress in ageing of hair.” Int J Trichology. 2009 Jan;1(1):6-14.Trüeb RM1. “Pharmacologic interventions in aging hair.” Clin Interv Aging. 2006;1(2):121-9.Disclaimer: The information contained on this site is intended for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice, diagnosis or treatment by a licensed physician.

                        Gray Disappear
                    

                            Posted by Reviewer2318294 on Sep 27, 2014
                    


                            I love this product. My hair grows really fast and it's great to use in between colouring. You actually can't tell you're using anything as it blends in so well with my hair colour and it's so easy to use. It feels nice as well. I've used other brands and they make your hair feel stiff and yuck. This is definitely the best.

                            Average coverage and a hard, unnatural look to the hair once the product dries. I won't be buying this again, but to be fair, I am not going to use any kind of hair mascara any more.

I have some growing white hair at the roots. It is very tedious to apply the mascara on every strand. It takes time to apply but it works.

As a "touch" up it is nice.  Works pretty well.

Recently, I had a chance to visit my grandmother, and I was excited because I only see her about three times a year. I was also eager to fill her in on an amazing trip I was about to embark on, lobbying in Washington, D.C. 
Grandma's response was, "What's wrong with your hair? It's so gray." 
Normally, a comment like that would have me running straight for the henna powder, but this time I chose to brush it off. I'm embracing my changing body and the new hair color my head has decided to sprout. I had been afraid of facing my roots, but now I'm ready to tackle this phase of my life.





Color-treated hair is a fine choice for many, but for me it's messy, time-consuming and expensive. So, what are some options for beautiful gray hair with minimum care?
Use a shampoo that is formulated to boost shine, which gray hair can often lack. ShiKai Color Reflect Platinum Shampoo is a shampoo that minimizes yellow, a huge problem for gray hair. This product gives me crazy shine, like my head could stand-in for the sun on cloudy days.
Make friends with your conditioner. Consider it your bestie! You're going to want to keep your hair super-moisturized. Gray hair has less of a protective cuticle (who knew?) so strands can get coarser and tend to break more easily. It's crucial to keep that hair hydrated for optimal shape.
Giovanni 2chic Brazilian Keratin & Argan Oil Ultra-Sleek Conditioner is a conditioner that fights frizz, which can be a common issue for gray hair. This formula is like a gift straight from the goddess. 
Apply a deep conditioning treatment to pump up shine and repair hair cuticles about once a week — or whenever you damn well please. (It's your hair, for Pete's sake!) I like vitamin E because we tend to have an abundance of it in my house at all times, but coconut, olive and avocado oils are all groovy choices too. Slather your head with the oil of your choosing, slap a scarf on that noggin and go to sleep. Wake up, wash it out and get ready for the gushing you'll receive from strangers on the street.





Add vitamins B6 and B12 — and oh yeah, why not add a high quality fish oil while your at it — to your daily supplement regime because they are good for healthy hair growth.
Try to stick with lightweight styling products, because gray hair can take on a greasy look really quickly. Also avoid products containing alcohol which can be super drying to already fragile hair.
I like Alba Botanica Strong Hold Style Gel because it's fragrance-free, and the older I get, the more artificial scents really bother me. My nostrils have been assaulted enough in my lifetime, thank you very much.
Stay out of direct sunlight because it can make hair dull-looking; but if you’re "the outdoor type" (which is a really great song, by the way), wear a hat or a dramatic head wrap. Imagine you're Little Edie in Grey Gardens.
If your end goal is to stop dyeing your hair but you're really unhappy about the contrast between gray roots and your color-treated areas, professionals recommend getting lowlights to help ease the transition. Alternatively, you can shave your head. Or you can just not freak out about it and just let your hair be a few color different colors for a while. Think of it as your own personal rainbow.
Have you embraced gray hair? What products have worked best for you?

        For Natural Hair Color, Color Your Hair with Natural Dyes
    

        If your hair color is looking a little tarnished, color your hair with one of these natural dyes, including chamomile, sage, henna shrub and black walnut hulls.
    


By Robin Shepard  |    March/April 1982





















 

 








 By experimenting with the formulas in this article, you’ll be well on your way to achieving just about any hair shade you’d like, without resorting to expensive, unsafe chemical dyes.

DON SCHMIDT
Lots of people occasionally have the urge to change or enhance their hair color, but are unwilling to use the harsh and, in some cases, potentially harmful hair dying chemicals found in most commercial dyes and color rinses.
If you’re concerned about the hazards that hair color ingredients present, you’ll be glad to learn that you can achieve results similar to those possible with beauty shop products, quickly, inexpensively and safely. Just as men and women have done for thousands of years, you can change your basic hair color, put new highlights in your locks or naturally darken gray strands using natural hair colors.
How Natural Dyes Work
Although there are a few especially potent exceptions (such as henna and walnut hulls, both of which I’ll discuss later), most herbal dyes act progressively, that is, they should be used repetitively over a period of time until the desired shade is achieved. Furthermore, I don’t know of any herb that'll actually serve as a bleach, but there are plant-based colorants that will highlight, darken, lighten or cover the gray in your hair.
Despite their versatility, however, herbal infusions cannot match the strength of commercial preparations, and, unless you decide to dye your curls black, an organic rinse won't cover your hair’s present shade. The best idea is to simply enrich the natural color of your hair, so avoid trying to make drastic changes (such as turning blond tresses to a very deep shade or dyeing gray hair darker than it was originally). You should also keep in mind that herbal dyes aren’t permanent and will fade unless renewed occasionally.

If you’ve recently used commercial dyes, color rinses or straighteners on your hair, you’d be wise to test any herbaceous dyestuff before applying it to your head, since chemical residues left in your locks may make it impossible to predict the action of the natural treatment.
To perform the evaluation, you'll need to save some snips of hair from your next trim or cut a lock from the nape of your neck and prepare a small amount of whatever dye recipe you want to try. Following the instructions for that mixture, apply it to a sample of hair, then rinse the lock thoroughly and let it dry (in direct sunlight, if possible). Observe the result under strong, natural light, and if you want more or less color, simply adjust the number of rinses and/or the timing accordingly. After a couple of trial runs, you should be able to produce exactly the shade you want.READ MORE
Here are several “prescriptions” that should serve at least to introduce you to the ancient science of herbal hair coloring. These few formulas (the possibilities are almost unlimited) will allow you to produce some of the most frequently used natural rinses and dyes. Whether you’re fair- or dark-haired, you should be able to find something here that will give you attractive and safe results when you try it.
More Fun for Blonds
Chamomile is probably the most popular herbal hair colorant among blonds. A weekly rinse with this herb tea will also remedy the brown streaking that results from overexposure to the sun, and brighten “dishwater blond” hair.
To prepare a chamomile rinse, steep half a cup of the flowers in a quart of boiling water for half an hour. Then strain the mixture, and let it cool while you shampoo. Now, pour the brew through your towel-dried hair at least 15 times (catching it in a basin each time, in order to use it again). Wring the excess moisture out and leave the solution in your hair for a quarter of an hour before rinsing it out with clear water.

Don’t limit your herbal experiments to chamomile, however. Just about any yellow-blossomed flower or herb can be used on blond hair, including calendula (it’s also called pot marigold), mullein blooms and leaves, yellow broom flowers, saffron, turmeric and quassia chips.
Lemon is also a time-honored hair lightener. The juice of two of the citrus fruits, strained into a quart of water, makes an excellent rinse that can be used in the same way as the chamomile preparation. Try to dry your hair in the sun after using a lemon rinse, in order to get the most from the treatment’s lightening effect.
Another native dye favored by blonds is prepared from rhubarb root, and it’ll add attractive honey gold tones to light brown hair, as well. To put those glints in your locks, pour three cups of hot water over four tablespoons of chopped rhubarb root, and simmer the concoction for 20 minutes. Strain it, pour it through your freshly shampooed hair 15 or more times, rinse in clear water and again, weather permitting, dry it in the sun to strengthen the effect of the dyeing agent.
A Bonus for Brunets
For over 5,000 years, Egyptians have used a dark powder made from the henna shrub to give their hair and beards an auburn tint. Nowadays, you can buy henna powder from many herb supply houses and some health food stores and co-ops. It’s known as a safe, healthful dye, and — since it coats the cuticle layer of each strand — it’ll actually make your hair feel thicker. However, be warned that henna tends to produce an almost brassy orange-red shade when used alone, so it’s best to mix it with a “lighter” herb like chamomile. (Since it is so strong, henna shouldn’t be used at all by persons with white, gray or very light blond hair.)
Always try a timed test swatch first, too. Otherwise, you might end up with an unexpectedly bizarre orange head! If you’d like to mix up my favorite recipe (I’ve found that it puts pretty reddish gold highlights in my dark mane), measure one part of powdered chamomile and two parts of powdered henna into a nonmetal bowl, then add enough boiling water to make a thick paste. Stir in a tablespoon of vinegar (which will help release the plants’ colors) and let the blend cool for a few minutes.


-Advertisement-






When the paste is lukewarm, put on a pair of rubber gloves (henna can stain your palms and fingernails, too) and massage it into your clean, wet hair. Comb it through with a wide-toothed comb to insure even distribution of the dye. Next, pile up your hair, fit a plastic bag over it and wrap a heavy towel around your head to hold in the heat.
You’ll need to leave the dye and towel turban in place for anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours: The darker your natural hair is, the longer you'll have to wait for the henna-chamomile to take effect. When the time is up, remove the towel and bag and rinse your hair until the water comes clean, then allow the newly colored tresses to air-dry, as usual, in the sunshine if possible. (Any stains that the dye might leave on your hands or around your hairline can be removed with a little elbow grease and lemon juice.)
Should you prefer a simpler (and slower-acting) procedure, you can make a weaker solution of the herbs and use it as you would any of the previous color rinses. Just mix together one tablespoon each of henna, chamomile and vinegar, then steep them in a quart of boiling water for 15 minutes. Naturally, you should cool and strain the liquid before using it.
Some “Sage” Advice
Of course,darker-haired beauties sometimes need to enhance the color of their locks, too, and sage is one of the oldest (and most effective) colorants for use on dark brown or black hair. A rinse made from sage leaves can be used to deepen any brunet shade, and it’ll also effectively cover gray in dark hair.
A sage rinse can be made by steeping a handful of the dried herb in a quart of boiling water for 30 minutes (longer, if you want a darker tint). Cool the infusion, strain it and pour it through freshly shampooed hair 15 or more times. Then wait 10 minutes before washing the liquid out with clear water. Because a sage rinse is a progressive dye, you’ll have to apply it weekly until you produce the shade you want, and then continue using it once a month to maintain that color.
Tag alder bark is another popular hair-darkening botanical, but it generally produces a lighter tone than sage, so it’s best when used to darken blond hair or to cover gray in locks that are light to medium brown. To make a tag alder rinse, simmer an ounce of bark chips (your health food store can likely order them from an herb supply firm) in a quart of water for about half an hour, then cool and use it exactly as you would the sage rinse I’ve already described.
A very dark, sable-colored dye can be obtained from walnut hulls, but this one is tricky, since the nuts’ outer casings tend to stain everything they touch (for that reason, I recommend that you wear gloves throughout all stages of the process, and avoid rubbing the mixture into your scalp). To prepare the dark juice, first crush the hulls in a mortar, cover them with boiling water and a pinch of salt, and let them “soak” for three days. Then add three cups of boiling water and simmer the hulls, in a nonmetal container, for five hours (replacing the water as it steams away). Strain off the liquid, place the walnut hulls in a cloth sack, and twist it tightly to wring out all remaining juice. Finally, return the expressed liquid to the pot and reduce it, by boiling, to about a quarter of its original volume. The resulting brew can then be used to whip up a rich walnut dye, as follows.
Add a teaspoon of ground cloves or allspice to the prepared extract. Allow the dye mixture to steep in the refrigerator for about a week (shaking it frequently during that time). When it’s ready for use, strain the liquid (using a piece of cheesecloth) and pour it at least 15 times through freshly shampooed hair before rinsing it out thoroughly.
By experimenting with the formulas contained in this article, you’ll be well on your way to achieving just about any hair shade you’d like, without resorting to expensive, unsafe chemical dyes. Soon you should be able to experience the same pleasure I feel when dyeing my tresses with herbs. I know — while doing so — that I’m not only saving money by using easily gathered materials, but also protecting the health of my locks. If you experiment a little, you can have fun coloring your hair, too ... naturally!

                                    Henna/Indigo are the best!  It does no damage to the hair.  I use Rainbow Henna (available at healthfood stores or online) that is a mix of henna and other herbs such as indigo, chamomile, etc.  It makes my hair so soft and shiny.  It works just as well as regular hair dyes, but does not kill the hair.  I do have some greys, but I mix mine with black coffee, apple cider vinegar, and yogurt.  I leave it on for 90 min w/ a plastic bag and then a towel. It's a little messier than dye, but your hair will thank you, plus there are no chemicals like herbatint or naturcolor.  I do this every two months and I get tons of compliments.  It's only about $6 for a container of this henna.  Try it out!  If you like it, you can order it in bulk on Amazon!

                                    Faith- You are correct, there is no such thing as black henna. The powders and dyes sold as black henna usually have some nasty toxic chemicals in them. There is also no "clear" henna. Henna is red and that's it! You can modify the color with other herbs and extracts. To get a true black hair dye, you do a base layer of henna, and then another dye session using indigo. It gives a very nice natural black. I have to disagree with the author on henna. I have been using it since I was a teenager (I am 40 now). I have a lot of gray in my hair and henna covers it beautifully. Henna is brassy the first couple of days after dyeing, but it oxidizes to a more muted and natural shade very quickly. Henna also applies better as an "acid" dye. Human hair is like wool and other protien fibers. I mix mine with straight lemon juice and a little bit of coconut oil for extra conditioning. There is no need to heat anything, just let it sit covered for about 8 hours to get the best dye release. You can modify henna by making a strong tea of rose hips, or mexican saffron (you still use the lemon juice as the main liquid though). Beet juice, cherries, and red wine have all produced nice results too. The longer you leave a henna dye on, the more intense the color. I put a plastic shopping bag over my hair and cover it all up with a bandana and sleep on it.  There are some great resources on the web, and tons of photos of the varying shades you can achieve with henna mixed with other natural ingredients!

                                    Tips for walnut dying: After making the walnut "juice" (simmering, straining, etc), boil it down for another 30 minutes to thicken it. Add a tsp of corn starch (pre-dissolved in a tbsp of cold water).  You can then mix the (room temp / cold) dying liquid in with a blended avocado, or a whipped egg white, or honey and oil, or thick conditioner, or full fat mayo. This will make it WAY easier to apply (and it's so good for your hair) and it will give you a few seconds to wipe it off before your skin before it stains (pure liquid stains much more quickly). Use a squirt bottle to access the back of your head without drips.
Cover your head with a bag after and gently blow dry your head (don't melt the bag) - the heat will help the dying the process.

And while you can use just about any part of the walnut, the husks are the best. You can get these for free outside in the fall if you know where to look!  You'll want to use 5-10 walnut husks per dye application depending on the size of the husks, how finely you crush them and how much hair you have.  Freeze extra hulls for use during the rest of the year.

Don't forget to eat the walnuts! After hulling, let them dry for a month in an old onion bag and then crack with a hammer.

                                    I started dying my hair with tea a few months ago.  I use one large teabag of Lipton, one regular teabag of Rooibos (roy-boss).  I start the tea before bed (cold water), warm it slightly before my shower, then pour it over my towel-dried hair.  My silver hair is now a very soft and natural golden brown.  In the light it has definition and highlights.  I leave the tea in and let it dry.  I repeat every other day.  My commercially dyed ends are almost grown out.  The tea dye is much prettier than any commercial product I used.

                                    Naturtint Hair Color is the best! This is an excellent product and is all natural as far as I know. It covers gray hair and will not wash out like henna does. My hair look healthy and shiny. It does not dry your hair like the harsh chemicals do. I discovered it and will not use anything else.
My Grandmother died from breast cancer and have several aunts with breast cancer, so I try to be careful about the things I use and eat.

                                    use the organic soaps from www.theorganicsoapcompany.com after you and before you use a natural dye...your color will look and last much longer since you will be using an organic soap produc.

                                    Herbal preps are an excellent way to gently enhance colour/mask grey. I have successfully used a dried sage steep to enhance my honey tones/brown hair with quick and terrific results. [That's the plus side] Unfortunately, the sage has also sent my blood pressure temporarily through the roof. As a one-time chesmist, I did a bit of sleuthing and found that indeed sage does do this. The active ingredient in sage stimulates local ciruclation (terrific! as this will help hair growth) but it also has systemic effects (not so terrific :/ ). It is contraindicated for those with hypertension and should not be used in the 1st trimester of pregnancy.

So we shouldn't forget, that everything must be used respectfully and with caution.

Anyone tried wallnut hulls??

                                    Faith,

What you are speaking of is para-phenylenediamine (PPD), an amine compound used in many hair dyes that can cause serious reactions. The term "black henna" refers to something that doesn't exist: henna strictly imparts a red tone to hair. Any other color indicates there are other compounds added to the dye.

See this site for more information: http://www.hennaforhair.com/ppd/index.html

There are natural and safe ways to obtain brown or black hair through various mixes of henna and indigo plants, which are also listed on the above site in greater detail.

http://www.hennaforhair.com/mixes/index.html

Good luck.

                                    I really enjoyed the natural hair colorant article and just have one concern, based on rumors about black henna having dangerous compounds in it that leach into your body and cause some type of permanent damage to it.  This info came from a doctor that investigates ingredients in cosmetics and body care products. I used to use a henna with a black base pretty frequently as I wanted ash (not black, but light brown without the traditional red tones) color. I stopped after reading the article by a Dr. Christine --- as she seemed sincere and quite knowledgeable.  Since painting the hands with henna is popular, and black is often used, I would like to hear more about this as I am sure most people are unaware of any dangers here.  We should remember that just because a product is plant based does not mean that it may not have poisonous side effects.

Amazing Nutritive Ingredients


 


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
Comfrey Root Extract   (Symphytum officinale)It is a perennial plant with hairy stems and leaves, and can grow up to a height of two to five feet. The flowers can be white, creamy yellow, purple and red. Vitamin A and C are abundant in Comfrey. Besides, these essential vitamins, it is also rich in minerals such as calcium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc, and selenium. Comfrey roots and leaves are said to provide nutritive healing properties for all different types of ailments because of its high allantoin along with other substances that reduce inflammation and keep skin healthy.Horsetail Extract   (Equisetum arvense)It probably got its name due to its likeness to a horse's tail. In fact, the origin of its Latin name Equisetum, a combination of 'equs' meaning 'horse' and 'seta' meaning 'bristle' could be attributed to this resemblance. This relative of the fern is a descendant of large plants that grew on earth, some 270 million years ago. Silica in horsetail extract is thought not only to slow down hair loss in both men and women, but also encourages growth of new hair follicles. Horsetail extract helps to increase blood circulation, nourishes hair follicles and assist hair growth. The amino acids and phytosterols in horsetail help strengthen hair follicles while also reducing oil buildup on the scalp.Guava Leaf Extract   (Psidium guajava)Guava leaves has been traditionally used throughout history by many folk cultures. It can be used on damaged skin, acne, skin inflammations, irritation and itching. It is beneficial for fading blemishes and clearing dandruff. This leaf can be used on skin, scalp and hair. These leaves contain a number of beneficial substances, including antioxidants like vitamins A, C, B, K, Beta carotene, iron, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and flavonoids such as quercetin. Guava leaves contain powerful antibacterial compounds that work well for skin and scalp infections. It may help with inflammation and itching from dandruff.Banaba Extract   (Lagerstroemia speciosa)Banaba is a species of crepe myrtle tree that is native to Southeast Asia. It is believed that the leaves of banaba have therapeutic properties. Banaba Leaf Extract contains a compound known as Corosolic acid which is reputed for topical use to reduce lipid content of skin.Nettle Root Extract   (Urtica dioica)Nettle Root has been used since ancient times as a hair treatment, growth stimulant, and to help restore nutritive hair color and shine. It is said that the ancient Greeks, Romans and the native tribes of America, had used this herb for medicinal purposes. The root contains polysaccharides and lignans that have an effect similar to steroid hormones. It may that may possess antiviral properties and acts as an anti-inflammatory.  Plantain Extract  (Plantago major)Native Americans carried powdered roots of Plantain as protection against snake bites. The herb has a long history of use as an alternative medicine dating back to ancient times. Plantain contains allantoin which is an anti-inflammatory that kills germs, helps healing, and stimulates the growth of new skin cells thus benefiting your scalp and follicles.Burdock Root Extract   (Arctium lappa)It is popularly known as 'oriental ginseng' in Japan. The plant has large leaves and purple flowers resembling thistle flowers. The root of the plant is used for cosmetic and medicinal purposes, including promoting healthy hair. Burdock makes hair healthy by improving scalp circulation. It improves the strength and helps with hair loss. Burdock root is a very nutritious it contains a high amount of Vitamins A, C, B1, E, and K.Apple Cider Vinegar   (Malus domestica)Apple cider vinegar contains the mother of vinegar and is made using only the best freshly-pressed apples. The apple cider vinegar is raw, unfiltered and unpasteurized, preserving the fragile essential nutrients. It can inhibit bacteria, mold and germs, yet it is environmentally safe. Apple Cider Vinegar has been highly regarded throughout history. In 400 B.C. the great Hippocrates, Father of Medicine, used it for its amazing health qualities. It contains valuable enzymes, botanical acids and vitamins. Its nutritive acidity discourages build-up on the scalp and adjusts skin pH when applied topically. The acidity of apple cider vinegar changes the pH of your scalp, so it’s not an ideal environment for yeast that can cause dandruff to grow. Vinegar has been used for decades to help with dandruff.Aloe Vera   (Aloe barbadensis)Aloe Vera has been used for improving skin conditions as the ancient Egyptians called it the “plant of immortality.” A succulent plant with rejuvenating and soothing properties, aloe vera holds many benefits for the skin. It has been used topically for thousands of years to improve skin conditions. It contains vitamins A, C, E, B1, B2, B3, B6, and B12. Aloe Vera also contains over 200 other naturally occurring nutrients such as enzymes, amino acids and sterols. Aloe gel is extracted from the leaves of the plant and when applied to the skin, softens dead skin cells leaving the skin feeling soft and smooth.

I found your company online when grown my grey hair from coloring...it was damaged and there was tremendous hair loss.  Two years later I am still seeing hair growth!  My silver hair is moisturized, healthy & sparkly.  Your products smell amazing.  The skin care line is also unbelievable.  Thank you!!!  I get compliments all the time and refer people to your products.Debbie R  Victorville CAI think this ranks right up there with some of my favorite salon products!! I'm so glad I found this frizz hair butter treatment. I have fine hair that tends to be dry and frizzy and this makes my hair smooth, but doesn't weigh it down at all!Carol G Crawley WVI'm thrilled! This frizz butter transformed my fine, frizzy, color and heat damaged hair into soft, smooth shiny hair. I used this frizz hair butter and was amazed at how nice my hair felt. A little goes a long way, the frizz shea butter melts into your hair. I highly recommend it!Judith L Miami FLI have difficult hair - fine, frizz but thick and wavy.

Some people don’t mind it and embrace the salt and pepper look, while others do everything they can to keep the color alive. If you want to help your graying hair regain its natural color, we have the plant for you. You won’t have to resort to chemical dyes and other hair products. Sage is an ancient healing herb that has been used for thousands of years. People used to use it to help relieve gastric pain, but it has also been used to stop bleeding or as a natural disinfectant. Like the saying, “An apple a day keeps the doctor away,” there is a saying about sage that goes, “Who has sage in the garden does not need a doctor.” A sage plant in your garden works as a natural insect repellent, keeping your carrots, cabbage, strawberries, tomatoes, and marjoram fresh. Since dried sage leaves are fairly common, you can put them in your closet to keep it insect free. You can also use sage essential oil to make DIY cosmetic products. Sage leaves are commonly used in cooking and burning the dried leaves is a great way to make your house smell amazing. To keep the gray away, you have to make a natural solution that you’ll rinse through your hair. First, put 3-4 tablespoons of crushed, soaked sage in a half liter of water. Let that sit for 8 hours and then strain the liquid into a large pitcher. Don’t throw that crushed sage away because you are going to boil it in another half liter of water. Leave it boiling for five minutes and then remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool. Strain the liquid into the pitcher with the other sage water. How To Use: After washing your hair with a natural shampoo, rinse it with two cups of the sage solution. This will help restore your hair’s original color. If you have very dark or black hair, prepare the same solution, but use equal parts sage and black tea for best results. You can consume 1 cup of this mixture a day, or use 2 cups as a natural rinse. To whiten your teeth, you can rub fresh sage leaves on your teeth. You can also rinse your mouth with lukewarm sage tea to help prevent cavities. Rinsing with sage tea also helps to naturally freshen your breath! Source:http://goldenhealthylife.com/index.php/2017/05/24/sage-gray-hair-regains-color-teeth-become-whiter-discover-beauty-recipes-behind-plant/2017-07-05T17:19:20+00:00DherbsTags: Beautybeauty tipsDIYgray hairhairhair careherbssageShampooTeethwhiteningRelated ArticlesDherbs Launches New Detox Shampoo, Clary Sage3 DIY Herbal Deodorants That Definitely Don’t StinkMust-Eats For The Healthiest, Shiniest Hair EverRelated QuestionsClick here to view in a new windowQ: I have read that Peppermint, Lavender, Rosemary and Sage essential oils are all good for hair and stimulating hair growth. Would it be more beneficial to use them all at once for maximum result or should I just use the Rosemary and Sage only as you suggested? Also, I didn?t see any Almond oil so I was wondering if I could use Olive oil or Jojoba oil as a carrier oil.A: Yes they are great for stimulating hair growth; however, I would use them together or combined. ANY natural edible oil can be used - it's YOUR choice. Jojoba and/or sesame seed oil are the best oils for the hair.Click here to view in a new windowQ: Hi,    I just want to know how long is it safe to use the gray-less hair.

I have read even though herbs are natural there are side effects. Are they any long term side effects of sage? I believe I have read an article of long term use.

I forgot to tell you that I have been periodically been dying (coloring my hair) because I have so much  grey coming in. I am 40 years old and my hair is quite grey without the coloring. I recently switched to a brand that I bought in the health food store. Tell me is my hair falling out because I have  been coloring it? I just started coloring it the past four years due to greying. (I know young girls color their hair all the time just to experiment. I colored because of the grey). Is the coloring  getting me in trouble and causing the hair fall out. I color it myself not professionally. Tell me should I just stop all together with the coloring? What do you recommend to restore my hair?A: You cannot regain your hair without regaining your overall health including your hormonal health. First, detoxify your whole body (see Full Body Cleanse).

When her adult teeth came in, they were grey in color. I think she has only one cavity and she is 33, so her teeth seem to be strong, just an unattractive color. She has tried tooth whitening with no good results. It seems that they turned grey from the inside out. Is there anything natural that she can do to restore the white color that antibiotics robbed her teeth of?A: She has to reverse the damage of antibiotics by cleansing constantly to the duration contrasted with how long she took antibiotics. It's the only way since the problem originates from the inside out.Click here to view in a new windowQ: I was doing some research and ran across an article saying the right herbs could help with a spinal cord injury.

CONSIDER PERFORMING THE TOTAL WOMAN CLEANSE BUT ALSO CONSUMING FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SPECIFIC HERBS (VIA TEA, CAPSULES, OR EXTRACTS) DAILY. TAKE AS MUCH MSM SULFUR AS YOU CAN. THIS IS GREAT FOOD FOR THE HAIR AND KEEPS THE HAIR GROWING. TO FIX SPLIT ENDS, WORK ON YOUR OVARIES.Click here to view in a new windowQ: I usually wear an Afro, but now I keep my hair in braids under a hat. A month ago my hair began to break, and my scalp got very dry. So, I started using shea butter, and olive oil. It started to work, soon after I made the mistake of putting braids, with synthetic fibers in my hair. It tore the sides of my hair out. I have about 6 or more inches of my hair left. What should I do now?A: Pour the oil into your palms, and then rub into you hair and then comb! Hair should be shiny, and smell good.Click here to view in a new windowQ: My 12 year old daughter is losing her hair. Her hairline has significantly receded, and her hairline on the side of her face is behind her ears, are slick. She does not have a perm and has not for about 2 years now. It is ok to use the Hair Nail formula and the MSM Sulfur together? Should I change the dosage? I am also considering the Child Liquid Cleanser and the Green 10-day Cleanser. Can they be used together? Should I change the dosage? Backgroud: She had ringworm when she was about 6, and lost hair. It grew back. She got a perm around 10. After the second application I noticed that those spots that were lost when she was 6 were going bald again. She hasn't gotten another perm. In spite of that, the areas of loss have gotten larger. The natural hair stylist said it could be puberty induced alopecia. Please help...A: Target her nutrition! Put her on HAIR SKIN NAILS FORMULA, MSM SULFUR, IODINE PHOSPHATE, etc.Click here to view in a new windowQ: What can I do to stimulate and open up my hair shaft on the crown of my head?

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
