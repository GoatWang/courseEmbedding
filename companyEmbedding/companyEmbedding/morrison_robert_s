You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

He serves as a director of Illinois Tool Works Inc., where he is the lead director. 

The Board concluded that Mr. Morrison should continue to serve as a director of Aon due to his role as a chairman, president and chief executive officer of a large international food and beverage company and his additional executive background at large consumer product companies, which provide the Board with global management, financial and risk oversight experience.

Funeral Services for Robert S. Morrison, 92, of Ashtabula, a manufacturing entrepreneur, will be held 11 a.m. Friday at the Second Congregational Church, 319 Lake Ave., Ashtabula.



Mr. Morrison died Sept. 16, 2002, at his home after a lengthy illness.



Born November 19, 1909, in Ashtabula.



He graduated from Ashtabula High School and from Oberlin College with honors in economics.  He attended Harvard Business School and received numerous awards over the years including the Chamber of Commerce Award of Excellence.  Mr. Morrison received the President's Award and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the County Growth Partnership and Special Recognition by the State of Ohio Department of Developement.  He was the director of the Ohio Manufacturer's Association, Trustee of Grand River Academy and a member of the Second Congregational Church, serving as Chairman of the Board of Trustees and the Stewardship Committee.  He often said his social responsibility was to provide good employment for as many people as possible.



Always regarded as a man who expressed what he believed, he offered advice and encouragement to anyone who sought his help.  He was strongly instructive to elected officials about their responsibilities to the general public.  He knew what really mattered most to the average citizen.  



His love for animals led him to be instrumental in the construction of a new shelter for the Animal Protective League.  He and his wife, Helen, continued to be major benefactors to the league.  



Mr. Morrison's main hobby was golf and he supported local area golf teams



He wrote four books; The Con-Tax Plan; Inflation Can Be Stopped; Handbook For Manufacturing Entrepreneurs      and The Real War On Inflation Has Not Begun.  He was interviewed on national television many times and invited to discuss his ideas at the White House with President Ford's Board of Economic Advisors.  He was a frequent speaker before numerous groups around the USA.



He was a prolific and published writer, authoring a daily syndicated newspaper column as well as a series of articles for the Ashtabula Star Beacon on the importance of economics in daily living.



Mr. Morrison worked in economic  and marketing research in Milwaukee before moving to Ashtabula and establishing Morrison Motors, a Ford dealership.  He became President of the Ashtabula Industrial Corporation, which was founded by serveral Ashtabula businessmen to attract new industry to the area.



A lifelong entrepreneur he founded MFG in 1948, which eventually grew to include 12 divisions in serveral states.  He established a profit sharing bonus system for all MFG employees, which remains in effect today.  He was also a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Morrison Molded Fiber Glass Co. of Bristol, Va., MFG Justin Tank Company of Georgetown, Del., and Creative Millwork of Ohio in Ashtabula.  He assisted many companies in getting started in Ashtabula.



Robert Morrison developed many new processes and products, utilizing fiber glass reinforced plastics and was responsible for the Chevrolet Corvette having a fiber glass body.  For his contributions to the industry he was elected a charter member of the plastics Hall of Fame in 1973.



Survivors are wife, Helen (Scott); whom he married on July 22, 1939,; four children, Louise Raffa of Ashtabula; Robert D. Morrison of Ft. Wayne; Nancy Warner of Ashtabula and Richard Morrison of Concord Township; nine grandchildren, James and Douglas Morrison, Ann Qualls, Thomas, Robert and Alec Raffa, Garth Warner, Bethany Miller and Hilary Morrison; three great-grandchildren, Tyra Miller, Jalen Miller and Adil Morrison.



Friends may call 12-2 and 5-8 p.m. Thursday at the Ross-Billman Funeral Home, 526 W. Prospect Rd. Ashtabula.  The Rev. Glen Warner will officiate services.  Burial will be in Ridge View Cemetary, Ashtabula.



Family suggests contributions be made to the Second Congregational Church of the Animal Protective League.  Envelopes will be available at the funeral home and the church.
