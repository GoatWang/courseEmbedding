                    My husband & I recently moved to Klamath Falls, OR. We love it here with the small town atmosphere and is very easy to get around in town.  Very friendly town, everyone is happy to help, a close knit community.   Many homes have been around for a while, may need a little TLC. 
Weather is nice, and get about 4 feet of snow annually that doesn't stick around for very long. 
Oregon is absolutely Beautiful! Fresh, clean air. Oregon has lots of things to do and see, Hiking, Camping all around and Creator Lake is approximately 1 1/2 hours away and a must see plus so much more!
