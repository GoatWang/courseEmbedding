Operator
Good morning. My name is Nicole and I will be your conferencing operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call.
All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Randy Burkhalter. Please go ahead, sir.
John Randy Burkhalter - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. Our speakers today will be Jim Teague, Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise and Director of Enterprise General Partner; and Bryan Bulawa, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of our senior management team are in attendance today for the call.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information readily available to Enterprise's management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Thank you, Randy. Our business continued to perform well in the first quarter, benefiting from our integrated systems, the momentum from an improved price environment, but I think most of all from the relentless drive of our employees. As demand-oriented projects such as ethylene plants, fire generation, and LNG exports begin to come online, we believe the U.S. is entering into a period of strong demand growth.
While many companies have been busy trying to weather the storm of the last two years, we've positioned ourselves for the demand phase of the cycle and are set to benefit from the demand increases that are coming for U.S. hydrocarbons. It felt good to see the word record in our press release, and with production coming back and a number of our own long lead time projects coming online, we hope to be using that word more.
Total gross operating margin was $1.5 billion, up 11% from first quarter of last year. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion and our distributable cash flow was up 7% with a coverage ratio of 1.3. Three of our four business segments reported higher gross operating margins than the same quarter last year. We had record NGL pipeline transportation volumes, record marine terminal volumes, and record onshore liquids pipeline transportation volumes of 5.4 million barrels a day.

Our biggest demand project, our PDH, remains on target to be up and running in the third quarter. Permitting and engineering is moving along for our iBDH plant, which is expected to be up in the second half of 2019. Both of these projects are similar as the movement towards increased ethane cracking that brought us numerous feedstock opportunities is now giving us the opportunity to take growing LPG volumes and turn them into higher value propylene and butylene.
In April we announced that we'll develop ethylene storage and transportation in and around our U.S. Gulf Coast assets. Because we are already connected to every ethylene plant in the U.S. and supply them with substantial amounts of their ethane and propane, as well as their storage needs, we feel like we can add value to these customers storing and transporting their ethylene. We expect that to be online in 2018.
As to supply projects in the Permian, we recently announced a major NGL pipeline, our Chinook pipeline. The pipeline will have an initial capacity of 250,000 barrels a day but it's expandable to 600,000 barrels a day. We expect that in service in the first half of 2019. This pipe adds to our other west-to-east NGL pipelines in moving NGLs to our fractionation storage, distribution and export systems at Mont Belvieu.
We recently added two new processing plants in the Permian and have a third, our Orla plant, under construction, and frankly we expect to add more processing in that Basin as our forecast indicated that additional gas processing will be needed. We have Plant 9 (04:46) under construction in order to support all of these liquids, which is expected to be up and running in the first half of next year. Our Midland-to-Sealy crude pipeline is currently under construction with an expected in-service date late this year, ramping up to full capacity early next year.
There are two areas that have been seen as laggards over the last couple of years, the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville. Starting with the Haynesville, over the last 12 to 18 months, there have been significant M&A activity. The buyers are applying new drilling and completion techniques, have very low breakevens, and are experiencing significantly improved initial production rates and reserves, and they are committed to the Basin and are moving quickly to maximize their returns. After bottoming at 12 rigs last year, Haynesville rig counts have improved considerably to around 40, and there were over 100 wells drilled in the play in the first quarter.
With parties like Covey Park considering IPO, it appears that capital markets understand the capabilities of these new producers and the capabilities of the Haynesville. With this increased level of activity, volumes in our gathering systems are increasing rapidly. In fact by year-end we project that our State Line system in North Louisiana could exceed our peak volumes of a half of 1 Bcf set back in 2011.
This outlook was a key driver behind our recent acquisition of the Azure gathering and processing assets. These assets access both rich and lean Haynesville and Cotton Valley production and are an excellent fit with our systems in East Texas and Louisiana. In addition these assets complement our supply footprint and will help us grow our Gulf Coast markets. We feel good about what we have seen from this new type of Haynesville producer, and we like where the production sits relative to growing demand.
In the Eagle Ford, similar to what we have seen in the Haynesville, Eagle Ford acreage is now beginning to turn over in a trend that is expected to continue. The highest profile resale was Anadarko's sale to Sanchez, but there have been others, including Pioneer selling some of their Atascosa County acreage, and acreage sales by Newfield, SM, and Rosetta. Obviously the cost of entry is much lower in the Eagle Ford than the Permian, and the Basin has technical upside both in new drilling and completion techniques, and in the spec phase now being developed in the Upper Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk, and the Buda.

After hitting the low of 30 rigs last October, the Eagle Ford rig count has moved up to around 80, with 800 wells permitted and 500 horizontal wells drilled during the first quarter. While rig count increases – instantaneously bring incremental volumes, we project that Eagle Ford production is now stabilizing and will soon begin to grow. As Eagle Ford production grows, we have the capacity in our existing assets, so increased production means cash flow upside. And from a competitive standpoint, our Enterprise value chain is hard to match.
We also believe there isn't a better Basin situated for the growth in the crude, NGL and gas markets including exports.
Finally, we think it's important that the market appreciates the ability of the Houston Ship Channel to handle the growth in energy exports that we expect to occur over the next 5 to 10 years. With our facilities at our Enterprise hydrocarbons terminal and at Morgan's Point, there isn't a company that has more experience and more conviction around the capabilities of the Houston Ship Channel than Enterprise. Over the years we've become used to rhetoric from competitors trying to get a toehold into exports. But recently, the Houston Ship Channel has been the recipient of deceptive allegations from folks promoting other Texas ports. Frankly, because they don't have and can't get a position on the Ship Channel. I've read commentary from so-called experts, many of whom have never loaded a ship, about growing congestion on the Houston Ship Channel. People are entitled to their own opinions. They are not entitled to their own facts. Here are the facts.
Actual ship traffic data shows that the Houston Ship Channel operates at well under 60% of its peak day capacity. Nothing compares to the Ship Channel's capabilities. Nowhere has the combination of over 100 pilots, designated barge lanes, two-way traffic, a draft of 45 feet, max beam of 170 feet, air draft of 175 feet, and probably most important, somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 berths. The ability to stage a lot of vessels at multiple docks is what really allows ship traffic to move in and out smoothly. There's a reason the Houston area is considered the energy capital of the world. One reason is the Houston Ship Channel.
Another reason is refining capacity that offers producers a domestic market of 4.5 million barrels a day of crude and more storage than all other Gulf Coast locations combined. All of these gives producers the two things they value the most: full assurance and market choices. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bryan.
Bryan F. Bulawa - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.
I will discuss a few income statement items for the first quarter; provide an update on our growth and sustained capital spending for 2017, and wrap up with an overview of our balance sheet metrics and capital raising activities for the quarter. But before doing so, I'd like to reiterate comments I've made in the past regarding revenue and seasonality.
The changes in revenue and operating costs and expenses are largely influenced by changes in commodity prices and are not typically an accurate depiction of the partnership's performance. In contrast to the past few quarters, the first quarter of 2017 revenue was up 46% when compared to the same quarter of 2016 while associated costs and expenses were up 53%. We believe total gross operating margin is a better performance-based metric. And as Jim mentioned, it increased 11% to $1.5 billion for the first quarter of 2017 when compared with the first quarter of 2016.
Also it's important to be reminded that the fourth and first quarters are typically our seasonally stronger financial performance quarters.
Now moving along to income items for the quarter, net income attributable to limited partners for the first quarter of 2017 was $761 million or $0.36 per unit on a fully diluted basis compared to $661 million or $0.32 per unit on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter of 2016. It was a relatively clean quarter with no material nonrecurring items.

Total capital spending in the first quarter of 2017 was $460 million, including $48 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For the full year of 2017 we expect organic growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.75 billion and sustaining capital expenditures to come in right around $250 million. This is slightly elevated from the levels provided during the Analyst Day given the number of new organic projects we've announced and were mentioned earlier in Jim's comments.
In addition, we recently closed the previously announced $189 million acquisition of the Midstream assets – Midstream business and assets of Azure Midstream Partners through a bankruptcy-directed auction process. At March 31, 2017, our total debt principal outstanding was $23.6 billion. The average life of our debt portfolio was 16 years. And our effective average cost of debt was 4.6%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017 was $5.3 billion, and our consolidated leverage ratio continues to trend lower after peaking near 4.5 times in third quarter 2016. For the first quarter of 2017 it was 4.27 times after adjusting debt for the 50% equity treatment ascribed by the rating agencies for the hybrid debt securities and we reduce it further for cash and cash equivalents.
Further, when we adjust debt for elevated working capital levels associated with short-term continuing opportunities across commodities and contracted growth projects under construction, our adjusted leverage ratio was just under 4.2 and 4 times, respectively.
For the first quarter of 2017 we retained $238 million of distributable cash flow and raised $449 million in net equity proceeds from our distribution reinvestment program, our employee unit purchase program, and the aftermarket or ATM program. To that end we had record unaffiliated unitholder participation in our distribution reinvestment program that was paid in February, which raised $90 million in equity proceeds.
Finally, our consolidated liquidity was approximately $4.1 billion at March 31, 2017, which included available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Randy.

Certainly. It is now time for the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to see if you could give a little more color on how to think about the competitive positioning of your oil, gas, and NGL pipelines in the Permian. You've mentioned before that your crude acreage dedication could be a primary feeder to your oil pipeline. Would those be the same customers on your other pipelines? Or is it just a totally different set that you're pitching?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
I think it's a mix. Some of the customers will be the same, but there will be others that will be different.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. So the acreage dedications support the crude pipeline, but not necessarily the other pipeline?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
That's correct. They would be individual, per pipeline.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And separately, I get a lot of questions about whether processing capacity could be a bottleneck in the Permian. I think you've said before that you don't expect that due to the no permitting and quick build time for the plant, but I just wanted to get your latest view on that.

A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
I'm sorry, I missed your question. You said what now?
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Whether processing capacity could be a bottleneck in the Permian?
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Not if we have anything to do with it.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP

Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Good morning, everyone.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Good morning, Brandon.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Let's see. I'll circle back on the NGL pipeline. What, just broadly from a macro perspective, what are you guys seeing in terms of takeaway capacity over the next five years for NGLs out of the Permian? And are you thinking – how do you think about market share gains relative to your competitors over that five-year period for NGL takeaway in the Basin?
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Brandon, this is Tony. When we made our announcement on our NGL pipeline we said it was expandable, and as we see the numbers at current drilling rates, that we think there's a good chance that over the time period that you discussed that we will be expanding it. That's how we see it.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. Related topic, the Texas interstate system – natural gas system – saw a downtick year-over-year. What's, and probably for Tony, what's the trajectory there from your expectations going forward?
Bradley Motal - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Hi, this is Brad. I think that from a trajectory perspective we – kind of seen the bottom and I suspect that we'll start to see some upside on a go-forward basis as we maximize the use of the pipes out of the Permian going east and south and then with the pick-up of the Eagle Ford we should see some revenue growth there as well.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's my two. I'll circle back. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of TJ Schultz with RBC Capital Markets.
TJ Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess just first, if you can give any update on Centennial, just discussions with customers on needs for diversification and how much that may ultimately play into the dynamic, I guess just to find a second market for NGLs.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Well, the Centennial project is a slow play right now. These projects require a multitude of players to be involved. They have fast phases and slow phases and we're in slow phase. We've suspended work in the field. We're pressing on with our negotiations with shippers, Northeast producers that want additional access to the Gulf Coast market for their propane. And we're calling on other people to see if they would be interested to be shippers. And when there's sufficient volume, demand, there'll be a project. I think we're a long way from talking about abandonment but until there's a volume at acceptable levels to justify a project, it won't go forward. But the good news I think in that is that because of the acceptable range of volumes that would justify the high end of that is very realistic; it should be just a matter of timing. But until it's there, until the demand's there, there's no project.
In a nutshell, TJ, we're not going to chase it. If people want it, we'll do it, but we're not going to chase it.
TJ Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, that makes sense. I guess second would just be on the Eagle Ford and Haynesville, you spent some time there. So you see leases turning over; you just bought the Azure assets. I guess, are there other assets in those particular Basins that you think make sense potentially from an M&A perspective or is Azure kind of a one-off and the message is just that more that there's open capacity right now in your system that you'll participate in with minimal CapEx?

A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
I think Azure was a unique situation that fit us like a glove. And I think that the Eagle Ford, we'd like to see production come back more, Tony thinks it will, we've got plenty of capacity to handle it without doing a heck of a lot in the Permian. We found that it's more economical to build than to get caught up in the frenzy of paying high premiums for existing assets.
TJ Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank.
Kristina Kazarian - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning, guys.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Good morning.
Kristina Kazarian - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Jim, you started off talking about the multi-year period of petchem demand growth that we're going into. And I know you guys announced a handful of new projects in the quarter. But maybe could you talk high level about like what the next set of major infrastructure needs or projects EPD is kind of focused on to meet these needs? And I guess most importantly, how big could this opportunity be?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Well, with PDH and iBDH it's pretty big already, Kristina. But from an ethylene perspective, I think what RB and his group's putting together is kind of sticking your toe in the water to see where we can go with ethylene logistics. I think putting together a storage system that the entire Gulf Coast can use; putting together a distribution system is a first step.
Now we, RB has worked tirelessly on ethylene export. But the question there is how long is this market, how long is it with ethylene for how long. And we'll keep working that and see where it goes. But right now, we just kind of like what we're doing. Just a minute, I'm getting a note. And then Tony's reminding me that he thinks that there's a second wave of crackers that will be built in the U.S. He doesn't think we're through building crackers, which will be supportive of us putting together kind of an ethylene hub and distribution center and will be supportive of our ethylene delivery infrastructure.
Kristina Kazarian - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Perfect. So I guess my follow-up will be maybe just timeframe on those latter two points. So, timeframe to developing a lot of the infrastructure needed to handling the end products on the ethylene side. And maybe timeframe to Tony's second wave of crackers that maybe, might be coming.
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
This is Tony. So relative to the second wave, we're watching the announcements, quasi-announcements like everyone else. So let's think in the early 2020s. That's what we expect. And then relative to hub activities, RB will take it.
Roger B. Herrscher - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yeah. We're currently developing the pipeline, transportation and the storage. If the ethylene terminal goes, if the demand is there, it will go. But a lot of the crackers focus a lot on their feedstock supply and their derivative capacity. And what we have found is there's a little bit of a gap there on the ethylene side of the business that we're trying to fill their needs.
Kristina Kazarian - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Perfect, guys. Hope you win all of them. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Jim, maybe a question for you or Tony. I'd like your thoughts on the expectations that propane balances possibly could meaningfully tighten this winter. And what you think about the impact on market dynamics and pricing, specifically if we don't have enough U.S. supply to meet LPG exports running at 850,000 barrels or 900,000 barrels a day without drawing down inventories, how do you guys think about capitalizing on what could be a very profitable arbitrage of securing propane near-term, storing it at Belvieu, selling it forward, especially if we're heading into a scenario where Mont Belvieu propane could sell at a premium to like Northwest Europe?

A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Hey, Darren. I wondered where you were.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I did too, Jim.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
And you didn't start out with saying nice quarter. Have you been hanging out with our NGL marketing guys?
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
As much as I can.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Now, you're speaking of contango obviously. And we did quite a lot of contango last year, Tuck (24:37). We haven't done – frankly we haven't had the opportunity to do as much, I don't think the first quarter as we did last year. But it is in our playbook. And the beauty of our system is when you have things like we've had the last couple of years, invariably it creates other opportunities that aren't otherwise there, contango being one of them. And we've got a system that can capitalize on that big time. Brent, Tuck (25:07), anything?
Brent B. Secrest - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Well, I think you're dead-on. This is Brent talking. The market has not told propane that it needs to be stored yet, and so you're starting to see some stuff happen. You're starting to see just from the industry talk cancellations happen this month and, yeah, for the month of May. But ultimately I think you're spot-on. The market will tell propane that it needs to be stored so that they can get geared up for this winter.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, Jim. By the way, good quarter. That's all I had. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Phillips with Guggenheim Partners.
Matthew Phillips - Guggenheim Securities
Good morning, guys. So, continuing on the petchem theme, Tony alluded to it before, but Exxon recently announced the possibility of a new cracker down near Corpus Christi. You all have a frac in Nueces County. I mean do you – that part of Texas is fairly light in NGL infrastructure. I mean, do you see the room for more of a build-up there? Whether it's your own assets or acquiring third-party assets?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
If they build that monster, we're certainly going to be in there pitching a system to supply it. If you look at – we say it a lot, for NGLs we're tied to every ethylene plant in the United States. We're very proud of that. And we're not going to let an ethylene plant come online that we don't have some kind of access to.
Matthew Phillips - Guggenheim Securities
Would it make more sense to extend Aegis that way? Or would you build a bespoke frac for a plant like that?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Well, the reality is we – from Mont Belvieu down to South Texas we have a 16-inch pipeline in ethane service that's bidirectional. So we call Aegis from Mont Belvieu to the river. The reality is we've got an ethane header from Corpus to the Mississippi River. So we're positioned to do some. But if they build what they say they're going to build, what is it, Tony, over 100,000 barrels, I think.
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Over 100,000 barrels a day.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
They're going to need an infrastructure. I bet we're talking to them out there.
Matthew Phillips - Guggenheim Securities
To that point, I mean the fact that Exxon and SABIC would build a plant of that size, does that kind of throw some cold water on the idea that we're going to be tight ethane anytime in the next five, six, seven years?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Personally, I'll let Tony weigh in, but as I look at all the associated gas and rich gas, I'm having a hard time thinking we're going to run out of ethane.
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP

Yes. Our balances for ethane, and we published them at the analyst meeting, changed considerably over the last year. So we have a slide. We published it in our investor materials all the time as to how we see it, and it's – the situation is much better than it was before. And out of the shales, ethane is plentiful and getting more plentiful all of the time.
Matthew Phillips - Guggenheim Securities
You mean, much better from a supply perspective?
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yes. Yes.
Matthew Phillips - Guggenheim Securities
Okay.
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
That's correct.
Matthew Phillips - Guggenheim Securities
Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Matt, I guess I want to add one other thing, Jim alluded to infrastructure. When we look at the second wave of crackers, they need services that, particularly around storage and transportation, that are offered in and out of Mont Belvieu. So I personally don't believe that you're going to disconnect Mont Belvieu from anything that happens further south, just like you didn't disconnect it from what's happening in Louisiana.
Matthew Phillips - Guggenheim Securities
Does it make sense for you to – would it dilute your turns to build a frac further south than I would at Mont Belvieu at this point?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
No.
Matthew Phillips - Guggenheim Securities
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks. Just coming back to the Permian and the gas takeaway question. I guess can you quantify how much gas you're moving or can you move right now on the Texas intrastates? Is it because you've got a lot of capacity on that system but it's hard to know exactly how much can come up right now before you get your new gas line built?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Brad?
Bradley Motal - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yeah. We can move – we've got the two pipes, the 36-inch and the 30-inch. We can move over 1 Bcf a day away from the area as it sits today. What I can tell you is on a daily basis, we run fairly full already because we've seen the volume start to show up, so.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then second question is when you think about, whether it's a Permian gas pipe or an NGL pipe, this mandate to use American steel, I think you mentioned that you always use American steel, but I'm just curious about your thoughts on the costs as they kind of come through the industry, how that might impact your ability to pass on if there are higher costs and earn the returns on capital that you want to earn?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
We're going to adjust the kind of deals we do based on what our costs are. The one thing is we – the fact that we've had a real initiative to build, Kevin (30:40), for the last eight, ten years that we were going to buy American. We've developed pretty good relationships with the mills and we think that gives us an advantage. Kevin (30:52), you've got anything to add? I mean, yeah, more demand probably increases costs but American capitalism is pretty neat. It has a way of making it up.
Unknown Speaker
Yeah. We've been successful so far. We haven't had the big, you know, price problems. And as you know, we've bought American on virtually all our major projects for some time.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC

Hi. Good morning, guys. A lot of my questions have been asked and answered but maybe just a quick follow-up. I think Kristina asked earlier about potential project opportunities and so forth. You know, excluding the gas pipeline that you're thinking about out of Waha, is there kind of a number that we're thinking about in terms of how big the backlog could potentially get to? Are we talking $1 billion to $2 billion more, are we talking something on the scale of $4 billion to $5 billion? I'm just wondering if you can sort of give us a frame of reference.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Well, I think our biggest problem is holding our people back. We never talk about our backlog. We don't publish that at all, we've got this many billions of dollars of backlog, but we seem to always – if we think we're going to spend a $1.5 billion two years from now, when we get there, it's usually a lot more.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
I mean, is there kind of like a capacity that you feel that you can handle on an annual basis? $4 billion to $5 billion is kind of your max capacity that your staff can handle? Or do you think that you can do something bigger than that?
Bryan F. Bulawa - Enterprise Products Partners LP
This is Bryan. We've had in the past, we've handled, quite handily, $4 billion to $5 billion without third-party acquisitions, and I think with our size and the access to capital markets to the extent there's opportunity there, we don't really see it as being a huge limiting factor. Of course we'll always instill the discipline that we've demonstrated over the years with respect to our balance sheet and approach in DCF coverage.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
Very helpful. And then just in terms of financing and equity needs and so forth, you've had a pretty decent quarter – or pretty good quarter actually – in terms of EBITDA and DCF and so forth. Does this take down your equity needs for this year? You've talked about being self-funding in 2018. Has that timeframe moved at all either up or backwards, just given the changes to your CapEx forecast?
Bryan F. Bulawa - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Well, just on your latter notion with respect to yes, being self-funded is dependent upon a recovery, and of course we're on that. The wind's not quite fully at our back at this point, but we are continuing to spend and find the opportunities. So the more opportunities we find, the less likely we'll be fully self-funded. But our equity needs, still as we look forward into 2018, remain light. And as far as this year, pretty much the last three quarters are a pretty good indication of the range of activity that we might have with respect to raising third-party equity.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
Perfect. Thank you very much, guys. Really appreciate the color.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Zarahn with Mizuho.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
On the Chinook (34:42) project you secured customer contracts. From a high level, how do you view producer willingness to sign contracts for existing projects, and potential future projects?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
If you look at that pipeline, the most reliable supply that you can have for a pipeline is that that comes out of your own plants, which should tell you something about our plans in the Delaware Permian from a processing perspective.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Understood. I guess maybe trying to extend throughout your other projects, how do you view the producer willingness to increase their contracted capacity? So for example, Midland-to-Sealy.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yeah. Midland-to-Sealy, I think we're going to be fine. We originally said that pipeline was going to come on at 300,000 barrels a day. We have opted to take it up to its full 450,000 barrel a day capacity. We did that because we feel like 300,000 barrels we'll be at easily. And there's room to grow. We're talking to a lot of folks. There's a lot of interest. I think a lot of the reason there's interest, it isn't just that they are signing up for a pipeline. They're signing up for a system that gets them to the water on the Houston Ship Channel, that gets them to a market that has 4.5 million barrels a day of refining capacity and gets them to a location that has tons of storage. So what they're looking at I think is this is ideal for giving me the flow assurance that I want and the ability to market my crude to a variety of customers.

Brian Joshua Zarahn - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Along those lines on crude exports, we've seen significant growth this year. And assuming the EIA data is correct, exceeding over 1 million barrels a day at times, how do you view the crude export opportunity given the current spread environment? And do you have enough capacity in the future to accommodate expected Permian production growth to load vessels?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Go ahead, Bob (36:57).
Laurie H. Argo - Enterprise Products Partners LP
I feel like we have plenty of capacity to handle it. And I'll let Brent speak to our future potential for crude exports.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
How much crude could we load today without spending a dime?
Laurie H. Argo - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Four million barrels a day.
Brent B. Secrest - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yeah. Four million barrels a day across all the terminals. And that can be increased for minimal dollar impact.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
On the our (37:23) piece, for a while last year we had structural working for us, and so we were doing quite a few exports just based on structure, not based on Brent WTI spreads. But as structures come in, you're seeing these spreads widen. You're seeing it widen all the way down the curve. Our belief, much like we said at the analyst meeting, is that these barrels have to clear on the water. There's only so much demand here domestically for this light sweet crude. It is the cheapest barrel that's going to be out there for the global market. And ultimately, this barrel it's not justified to be stored. So where's the next move? It goes out by the water.

But for the most part we have sold that capacity on a firm basis away. So it's – a lot of the day-to-day business that we do is not basis-oriented between Waha and South Texas.

Good morning, Faisel.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I had two questions, but then you threw out this 4 million barrel-a-day crude oil export number. I just want to clarify that. Is that just crude oil? Or is that – you're talking about total liquids, where it's products and crude oil and condensate? I mean, my understanding is you have to have segregated tanks. You've got to sort of – you can't just – they're not 100% interchangeable. I just want to make sure I understood your comment on the 4 million a day.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
I would tell you the 4 million barrel a day does relate to all the commodities you referenced. But as far as you don't necessarily have to have completely segregated tanks if you have the ability to completely drain a tank to load a ship so it's a clean tank for the next product. And that is across the system in that regard. It does not include refrigerated products in that number.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Right. But if you're already exporting sort of – the U.S. exporting 5 million barrels a day of total liquids products, I mean, it's displacement, right? You can't just like – if the product was in there to be exported, then you would have the excess capacity for crude but you have to actually have both, right?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
His number doesn't have anything to do with LPG, if that's what you're asking about.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Sure. No, but for the products, right? We export, what, the extra two, three million barrels a day of product. So I'm just trying to figure out how much excess capacity you have to move crude. I guess that's the – yeah, that's the more critical number as we grow production and keep product exports growing too, right?
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Faisal, this is Tony. From a fundamental standpoint, you're either going to export more crude or more refined product, not both, right? And the behavior of the refineries isn't that they're going to massively expand. So if we look at that capacity and say what's the guess, if you will, as to whether or not it's going to export crude or refined products, because it won't be both, we think that crude oil exports are the one that are the game just because the refineries aren't adding all over the United States. We just don't see that.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Sure. No, okay. That's fair enough. And last question just on the Midland-to-Sealy pipeline, going back to your comments, so do you have the – I think at the Analyst Day you commented that you didn't have the 300,000 barrels a day of contracts in hand but that you were sort of very close to sort of inking those deals. Has that been done yet?
Laurie H. Argo - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yes, we – well, we have the 300,000 barrels a day filled of capacity and we actually think that we'll be at the 450,000 barrels a day capacity upon start-up.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Sure, I mean my question was on the contracts though. Are the contracts at capacity?
Laurie H. Argo - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yes.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
What she's saying is we've got....
Laurie H. Argo - Enterprise Products Partners LP
We're up to 300,000 barrels a day.

A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yeah.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay, okay. Got it. Okay, makes sense. Okay. That's it for me, guys. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bushi with TIAA (43:22).
Unknown Speaker
Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Great quarter. I wanted to talk about the CapEx number that was up a little bit from the Analyst Day. Is that 2018 CapEx getting pulled forward or do you see new opportunities? And following up, do you expect if it is getting pulled forward from 2018 to replace that in 2018? Thanks.
Bryan F. Bulawa - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Michael (43:48), this is Bryan. That is not pulling 2018 forward, that is just the addition of the projects that have been added that has moved the 2017 number up. So also clearly we didn't talk about 2018 but our 2018 number has also moved up.
Unknown Speaker
Great, great.
Bryan F. Bulawa - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yeah.
Unknown Speaker
That's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Barrett Blaschke with MUFG Securities.
Barrett Blaschke - MUFG Securities America, Inc.
Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow-up on the commentary about a second round of cracker build-up, kind of timeline for that? And do you see it as all being Gulf Coast? Or do you see the East Coast finally trying to develop more of a local market around the volumes that are being produced up there?
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
This is Tony. So we see the timeline as early 2020s. And as we look at the projects for now we see it as all being Gulf Coast.
Barrett Blaschke - MUFG Securities America, Inc.
So, no thoughts on – I guess that all tries to remain an export market as it builds out?
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Up in the Northeast?
Barrett Blaschke - MUFG Securities America, Inc.
Yes.
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yes, sir. That's how we see it.
Barrett Blaschke - MUFG Securities America, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning, Jim.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Good morning.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC
Appreciate the comments about the many attributes of the Ship Channel; I was intrigued by the conversation earlier on the call about export capacity. So I just wanted to try and clarify, that 4 million barrel a day number that you quoted, I'm just trying to reference that relative to let's say what the 1Q volume was. So if I just think crude and refined products somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 million barrels a day, is that the right sort of starting reference point to think about your headroom without meaningful capital spend?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yes. That's probably in the ballpark. Yes.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Okay. And then second just – or as a quick follow-up, the number that you quoted for crude export last night, or I guess this morning, 475 – 475,000 barrels a day, was just slightly different than the number that I saw in the release in April. So I was just wondering if it was just a difference in definition? Or if I misinterpreted something? Or any help in clarifying that would be helpful.
John Randy Burkhalter - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yes. This is Randy. The press release that we put out in March was reflecting gross barrels. And then what we referred to in the press release, that's more our economic barrels, or net, our netted....
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Okay. Perfect, perfect. And a final just follow-up on exports, Jim, your comments in the release, you had talked about Morgan's Point ramping to sort of 125,000 barrel a day level by sort of the end of the year. Just curious, I know your slide presentation had sort of indicated around that range as an average for 2017, but you had mentioned in those presentation slides the opportunity of shippers to sort of flex around, customer elections might change. I'm just curious if I'm reading just way too much into your comment and nothing's changed? Or if there were any maybe changes in the election?

A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
I think you're probably reading a little much into it.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC
Okay. I'm at risk of doing that at times so that's fair. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.
John Randy Burkhalter - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Nicole, this is Randy. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. And your final question comes from the line of John Edwards with Credit Suisse.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the second wave of steam crackers in terms of size, I guess this first wave was around 700,000 barrels, give or take, of incremental ethane demand. So maybe, Tony, you can tell us what's – how big you see that second wave in terms of ethane demand.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
John, this is Jim and I'll turn over to Tony. You know, there's a basic assumption that is the gas to crude spread. So if you're assuming second wave, you're assuming a wide gas to crude spread, which frankly we do, but that can – you have crude fall relative to gas so that's a different ballgame, but we think it won't. So, Tony?
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Right. Yes, so we have been on the bandwagon that the U.S. has ample natural gas for a considerable time. But relative to the question, the projects that we are monitoring today have, call it, between 250,000 to 300,000 barrels of incremental demand. Those are the handful that we're monitoring today as I'm going to call them prospects, okay?
John Edwards - Credit Suisse
Okay.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
And that would include Exxon, SABIC, Tony?
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Yes, sir, it would.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse
Okay. Now does that include Shell's cracker in the northeast or no?
Anthony C. Chovanec - Enterprise Products Partners LP
Those are the existing wave. Those are being built. They're under construction. This is the second wave.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse
Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then just I guess for my second question, Jim, you made the comment better to build than buy in the Permian. So, you know, I just thought maybe you could give us a little more insight into the Permian opportunity. I mean obviously you've talked about some of these with the – your Midland-to-Sealy pipelines are, you think, is going to hit 450,000 barrels per day by the third quarter, obviously very bullish there. So any other comments you can make around opportunities that you're seeing in the Permian and how Enterprise can take advantage?
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
We're building a truck line upstream of Midland. What is that, Laurie, how long is that pipe that you're building up, the Loving County?
Laurie H. Argo - Enterprise Products Partners LP
From Loving County into Midland about 170 miles, 150 miles, 130 miles.
A. James Teague - Enterprise Products Partners LP
All right. So we are building upstream of Midland. We're being very disciplined. And I'm – I mean, heck, I don't know, we're pretty sold on the place. We're pretty proud of our position. I really don't know how to answer the question other than we continue to build out there in both crude gas and NGLs.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse
Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
John Randy Burkhalter - Enterprise Products Partners LP

Enviva Partners, LP Reports Increased Financial Results for First Quarter 2017 and Announces Wilmington Terminal Drop-DownPublished: May 10, 2017
BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 10, 2017--
      Enviva Partners, LP (NYSE: EVA) (the “Partnership” or “we”) today
      reported financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2017.
    

Highlights:



Generated net income of $2.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $22.9
        million for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $5.5 million and
        $16.6 million, respectively, for the first quarter of 2016


Declared a quarterly distribution of $0.5550 per unit, an 8.8
        percent increase from the distribution paid for the first quarter of
        2016


Agreed to acquire the Wilmington terminal and associated contracts
        early in the fourth quarter of 2017


Revised full-year 2017 guidance for net income to a range of $29.0
        million to $33.0 million and adjusted EBITDA to a range of $111.0
        million to $115.0 million, including the impact of the acquisition of
        the Wilmington terminal but excluding the impact of any additional
        drop-downs or third-party acquisitions



      “Enviva delivered solid operating performance in what typically is our
      softest quarter,” said John Keppler, Chairman and Chief Executive
      Officer. “Combined with the benefit of our recently acquired Sampson
      plant and DONG Energy off-take contract, we are right on track, year
      over year. With the expected fourth quarter lift from the Wilmington
      terminal acquisition, we are pleased to increase our 2017 distribution
      guidance to at least $2.36 per unit.”
    

Financial Results


      For the first quarter of 2017, we generated net revenue of $122.1
      million, an increase of 13.9 percent, or $14.9 million, from the
      corresponding quarter of 2016. Included in net revenue was product sales
      of $119.0 million on volume of 623,000 metric tons of wood pellets,
      representing an increase of $15.6 million from the corresponding quarter
      of last year. The increase in product sales primarily was due to higher
      sales volumes under our off-take contract with DONG Energy Thermal Power
      A/S, which we acquired in connection with the Sampson drop-down
      transaction on December 14, 2016 (the “Sampson Drop-Down”). Other
      revenue decreased to $3.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 from
      $3.8 million for the corresponding quarter in 2016.
    

      For the first quarter of 2017, gross margin improved to $18.5 million,
      an increase of $2.7 million from the corresponding period in 2016, and
      we generated net income of $2.5 million compared to $5.5 million for the
      corresponding quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $22.9 million
      in the first quarter of 2017, a $6.3 million, or 38.3 percent, increase
      compared to the corresponding period in 2016. The increases in gross
      margin and adjusted EBITDA were driven by increased product sales due to
      the Sampson Drop-Down and a favorable customer and shipping contract
      mix. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton was $43.19 for the first
      quarter of 2017, as compared to $40.42 for the first quarter of 2016.
      Net income decreased primarily due to higher interest expense.
    

      The Partnership’s distributable cash flow, net of amounts attributable
      to incentive distribution rights, increased from $12.7 million for the
      first quarter of 2016 to $14.6 million for the first quarter of 2017,
      resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.00 times.
    

Distribution


      As announced on May 3, 2017, the board of directors of our general
      partner declared a distribution of $0.5550 per common and subordinated
      unit for the first quarter of 2017. This distribution is 8.8 percent
      higher than the distribution for the first quarter of 2016 and 3.7
      percent higher than the distribution for the fourth quarter of 2016. The
      quarterly distribution will be paid on Tuesday, May 30, 2017, to
      unitholders of record as of the close of business on Thursday, May 18,
      2017.
    

Agreement to Purchase Wilmington Terminal


      The Partnership has agreed to purchase Enviva Port of Wilmington, LLC
      (“Wilmington”) from Enviva Wilmington Holdings, LLC (the “Hancock JV”),
      a joint venture between our sponsor and affiliates of John Hancock Life
      Insurance Company, for total consideration of $130.0 million comprised
      of two payments as described below. Wilmington owns a fully operational
      deep-water marine terminal in Wilmington, North Carolina (the
      “Wilmington terminal”) that we expect to generate approximately $16.0
      million in incremental adjusted EBITDA when it reaches its currently
      contracted run-rate.1 The acquisition of Wilmington (the
      “Wilmington Drop-Down”) is expected to close on or about October 2,
      2017, subject to customary closing conditions.
    

      The Wilmington terminal is capable of receiving product by rail and
      truck, storing up to 90,000 metric tons of wood pellets, and loading up
      to panamax-sized vessels. Wilmington is party to long-term terminal
      services agreements to receive, store, and load a total of approximately
      1.0 million metric tons per year (“MTPY”) of wood pellets from the
      Partnership’s production plant in Sampson County, North Carolina (the
      “Sampson plant”) and a third-party production plant for our sponsor,
      subject to deficiency payments if minimum throughput requirements are
      not met. The Wilmington terminal utilizes state-of-the-art handling
      equipment and storage infrastructure designed to maintain product
      quality and safety with throughput capacity of up to 3.0 million MTPY of
      wood pellets.
    

      The Partnership will make an initial payment of $56.0 million for
      Wilmington at closing. Upon the acquisition of Wilmington, we initially
      expect to generate incremental adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5.0
      million for 2018 and run-rate incremental adjusted EBITDA of
      approximately $8.0 million in 2019. The Partnership expects to fund the
      initial purchase price with borrowings under its revolving credit
      facility.
    

      In addition, Wilmington is party to a long-term terminal services
      agreement with the Hancock JV to receive, store, and load wood pellets
      from the Hancock JV’s planned production plant in Hamlet, North Carolina
      (the “Hamlet plant”). Wilmington’s terminal services agreement for
      production from the Hamlet plant is also subject to deficiency payments
      if minimum throughput requirements are not met. Our sponsor is
      completing the detailed design of the fully-financed Hamlet plant and
      has commenced site work and equipment procurement, with full
      construction of the build-and-copy replica of the Sampson plant expected
      to begin later this year and completion anticipated for late 2018.
      Production from the Hamlet plant is expected to supply MGT Power’s
      Teesside Renewable Energy Plant, which is currently under construction
      in the United Kingdom. Upon first deliveries to the Wilmington terminal
      from the Hamlet plant, the Partnership will make another payment of
      $74.0 million, subject to certain conditions. When the Hamlet plant
      commences operations, we expect the incremental adjusted EBITDA from
      Wilmington to increase to $14.0 million and to reach $16.0 million per
      year once the Hamlet plant reaches its expected full production rate of
      600,000 MTPY.
    

      For the Wilmington Drop-Down, Evercore served as exclusive financial
      advisor and Andrews Kurth Kenyon LLP served as legal counsel to the
      conflicts committee of the board of directors of the Partnership’s
      general partner. Vinson & Elkins LLP served as legal counsel to the
      Hancock JV.
    

Outlook and Guidance


      The Partnership has adjusted its full-year 2017 guidance to reflect the
      expected timing and partial year impact of the Wilmington Drop-Down. The
      Partnership expects full-year 2017 net income to be in the range of
      $29.0 million to $33.0 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of
      $111.0 million to $115.0 million. The Partnership expects to incur
      maintenance capital expenditures of $5.1 million and interest expense
      net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount
      of $29.7 million in 2017. As a result, the Partnership expects full-year
      distributable cash flow to be in the range of $76.2 million to $80.2
      million, prior to any distributions attributable to incentive
      distribution rights paid to the general partner. For full-year 2017, we
      now expect to distribute at least $2.36 per common and subordinated
      unit. The guidance amounts provided above do not include the impact of
      any additional acquisitions from the Partnership’s sponsor or third
      parties beyond the Wilmington Drop-Down. Although deliveries to our
      customers are generally ratable over the year, the Partnership’s
      quarterly income and cash flow are subject to the mix of customer
      shipments made, which may vary from period to period. As such, the board
      of directors of the Partnership’s general partner evaluates the
      Partnership’s distribution coverage ratio on an annual basis when
      determining the distribution for a quarter.
    

Market and Contracting Update


      Our sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the
      Partnership. Our current capacity is matched with a portfolio of
      off-take contracts that has a weighted-average remaining term of 9.8
      years from April 1, 2017.
    

      Several recent developments continue to underpin the significant growth
      in demand expected for wood pellets, especially in our core markets of
      Europe and Asia:
    


        As the European Union’s proposed 2030 goals for further emissions
        reductions and increased renewable energy generation progress through
        the legislative process, the European Union is developing a new
        strategy to almost completely decarbonize its economy by 2050. In
        addition, EURELECTRIC, an association that represents 3,500 companies
        across the European electricity industry, announced that power
        generators in most European Union countries committed to eliminate
        investment in new coal-fired power plants after 2020. These events
        demonstrate both the continued regulatory and energy industry support
        for further de-carbonization in Europe.
      

        The United Kingdom (the “UK”) recently completed a full 24-hour period
        without burning coal to generate electricity, a major milestone in its
        efforts to displace coal-fired generation. In addition, the UK
        Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (the “BEIS”)
        completed a study that confirmed wood fiber sourced using practices
        employed in the Southeast United States is a low-carbon, sustainable
        source of energy. After agreeing last year to extend the UK
        government’s powers to award new contract for difference (CfD)
        incentives for low-carbon energy projects out to 2026, the BEIS is now
        considering the potential implications of the study on future policy
        decisions and CfD awards.
      

        The Japanese government recently reconfirmed the targeted power source
        mix for 2030. The program includes 6.0 to 7.5 gigawatts of
        biomass-fired capacity, which represents demand for 15 to 20 million
        MTPY of biomass. Additional biomass-fired power projects have been
        announced, including Kansai Electric Power’s potential conversion of
        its Aioi power plant to wood pellets under a joint venture with
        Mitsubishi Corporation Power and Chubu Electric’s plan to build a new
        co-fired unit with capacity of approximately 1.0 gigawatt at its
        Taketoyo power facility.
      

        Driven by consumer preference, several multi-national corporations
        have announced specific commitments to significantly reduce carbon
        emissions and increase adoption of renewable energy across their
        operations and supply chains. Biomass-fired generation for the power
        and thermal needs of these operations is a reliable complement to
        intermittent wind and solar power.
      


      We remain in active discussions with customers in Europe and Asia for
      long-term off-take contracts for the supply of wood pellets to be
      fulfilled directly by the Partnership and by new capacity under
      development by our sponsor throughout the Southeast United States,
      including at its sites in Lucedale, Mississippi and Abbeville, Alabama,
      as well as other sites positioned to take advantage of the existing
      terminal capacity at the Chesapeake and Wilmington terminals. In
      addition, our sponsor continues to evaluate its option to build and
      operate a marine export terminal at the Port of Pascagoula, Mississippi,
      which could support wood pellet production from a potential production
      plant in Lucedale, Mississippi and other potential facilities in the
      region.
    

Conference Call


      We will host a conference call with executive management related to our
      first-quarter 2017 results and to discuss the agreement to purchase
      Wilmington, our outlook and guidance, and a more detailed market update
      at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Wednesday, May 10, 2017. Information on
      how interested parties may listen to the conference call is available on
      the Investor Relations page of our website (www.envivabiomass.com).
      A replay of the conference call will be available on our website after
      the live call concludes.

      ended December 31, 2016 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

      per year in Virginia, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Florida. In
      addition, the Partnership owns a deep-water marine terminal at the Port
      of Chesapeake, Virginia, which is used to export wood pellets. Enviva
      Partners also exports pellets through the ports of Wilmington, North
      Carolina; Mobile, Alabama; and Panama City, Florida.

1 A reconciliation of Wilmington’s estimated
            incremental adjusted EBITDA to account for anticipated throughput
            from the Hamlet plant to the closest GAAP financial measure is not
            provided because GAAP net income generated by the Wilmington
            terminal is not available without unreasonable effort, in part
            because the amount of estimated incremental interest expense
            related to the financing of the additional payment due upon first
            deliveries from the Hamlet plant is not available at this time.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      We use adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, and
      distributable cash flow to measure our financial performance.
    

Adjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton


      We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation
      and amortization included in cost of goods sold. We believe adjusted
      gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares
      our revenue-generating activities to our operating costs for a view of
      profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis. Adjusted gross
      margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet
      targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs
      associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production
      plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets.
    

Adjusted EBITDA


      We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation
      and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement
      of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset
      impairments and disposals, and certain items of income or loss that we
      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted
      EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users
      of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, and
      research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our assets
      without regard to financing methods or capital structure.
    

Distributable Cash Flow


      We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance
      capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt
      issuance costs and original issue discounts. We use distributable cash
      flow as a performance metric to compare the cash-generating performance
      of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the
      cash-generating performance for specific periods to the cash
      distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders.
      We do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure.
    

      Adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable
      cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.
      We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures
      provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial
      condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures
      should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable
      GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has
      important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some,
      but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP
      financial measures. You should not consider adjusted gross margin per
      metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, or distributable cash flow in isolation or
      as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our
      definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable
      to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing
      their utility.
    

      The following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin
      per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow to the most
      directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as applicable, for each of
      the periods indicated.

Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain statements and information in this press release, including
      those concerning our future results of operations, acquisition
      opportunities, and distributions, may constitute “forward-looking
      statements.” The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,”
      “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” or other similar
      expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which
      are generally not historical in nature. These forward-looking statements
      are based on the Partnership’s current expectations and beliefs
      concerning future developments and their potential effect on the
      Partnership. Although management believes that these forward-looking
      statements are reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that
      future developments affecting the Partnership will be those that it
      anticipates. The forward-looking statements involve significant risks
      and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Partnership’s control)
      and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially
      from the Partnership’s historical experience and its present
      expectations or projections. Important factors that could cause actual
      results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include,
      but are not limited to: (i) the volume of products that we are able to
      sell; (ii) the price at which we are able to sell our products; (iii)
      failure of the Partnership’s customers, vendors and shipping partners to
      pay or perform their contractual obligations to the Partnership; (iv)
      the creditworthiness of our financial counterparties; (v) the amount of
      low-cost wood fiber that we are able to procure and process, which could
      be adversely affected by, among other things, operating or financial
      difficulties suffered by our suppliers; (vi) the amount of products that
      we are able to produce, which could be adversely affected by, among
      other things, operating difficulties; (vii) changes in the price and
      availability of natural gas, coal, or other sources of energy; (viii)
      changes in prevailing economic conditions; (ix) our inability to
      complete acquisitions, including acquisitions from our sponsor, or to
      realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions; (x) unanticipated
      ground, grade or water conditions; (xi) inclement or hazardous weather
      conditions, including extreme precipitation, temperatures and flooding;
      (xii) environmental hazards; (xiii) fires, explosions or other
      accidents; (xiv) changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations
      (or the interpretation thereof) related to renewable or low-carbon
      energy, the forestry products industry or power generators; (xv) changes
      in the regulatory treatment of biomass in core and emerging markets for
      utility-scale generation; (xvi) inability to acquire or maintain
      necessary permits or rights for our production, transportation and
      terminaling operations; (xvii) inability to obtain necessary production
      equipment or replacement parts; (xviii) operating or technical
      difficulties or failures at our plants or deep-water marine terminals;
      (xix) labor disputes; (xx) inability of our customers to take delivery
      of products; (xxi) changes in the price and availability of
      transportation; (xxii) changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
      (xxiii) failure of our hedging arrangements to effectively reduce our
      exposure to interest and foreign currency exchange rate risk; (xxiv)
      risks related to our indebtedness; (xxv) customer rejection due to our
      failure to maintain effective quality control systems at our production
      plants and deep-water marine terminals; (xxvi) changes in the quality
      specifications for our products that are required by our customers;
      (xxvii) the effects of the approval of the United Kingdom of the exit of
      the United Kingdom (“Brexit”) from the European Union, and the
      implementation of Brexit, in each case on our and our customers’
      businesses; and (xxiii) our ability to borrow funds and access capital
      markets.
    

      For additional information regarding known material factors that could
      cause the Partnership’s actual results to differ from projected results,
      please read its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
      including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on
      Form 10-Q most recently filed with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to
      place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as
      of the date thereof. The Partnership undertakes no obligation to
      publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date
      they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, or
      otherwise.

THE WOODLANDS, Texas, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 

First quarter 2017 net loss of $0.6 million 
First quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $71.4 million and DCF of $53.0 million 
First quarter 2017 distribution coverage ratio was 1.19x 
Rig count increased significantly across SMLP's systems 
SMLP reaffirms full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $295.0 million to $315.0 million, with an annualized fourth quarter 2017 run rate between $325.0 million and $345.0 million









Summit Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:    SMLP) announced today its financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  SMLP reported a net loss of $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to a net loss of $3.7 million for the prior-year period.  Net cash provided by operations totaled $62.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $66.8 million in the prior-year period.  Adjusted EBITDA totaled $71.4 million and distributable cash flow totaled $53.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $70.0 million and $51.5 million, respectively, for the prior-year period. 
Natural gas volume throughput averaged 1,627 million cubic feet per day ("MMcf/d") in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 6.8% compared to 1,523 MMcf/d in the prior-year period, and an increase of 8.2% compared to 1,504 MMcf/d in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Crude oil and produced water volume throughput in the first quarter of 2017 averaged 76.4 thousand barrels per day ("Mbbl/d"), a decrease of 19.6% compared to 95.0 Mbbl/d in the prior-year period, and a decrease of 7.2% compared to 82.3 Mbbl/d in the fourth quarter of 2016.  SMLP's natural gas volume throughput metrics exclude its proportionate share of volume throughput from its 40% ownership interest in Ohio Gathering.
Steve Newby, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "SMLP's first quarter 2017 financial and operating results correspond with our expectations and full year 2017 financial guidance.  Over the last several months, drilling activity has increased significantly across our systems.  We expect volume growth from this drilling activity to positively impact our operating and financial results in the second half of the year. 
We took advantage of a favorable capital markets environment in the first quarter of 2017 by accessing the bond market for $500.0 million of senior notes at a 5.75% coupon.  This opportunistic financing enabled us to repay all of the outstanding debt under our 7.50% senior notes, extend our debt maturity profile, and term out $172.0 million of revolver borrowings.  
We continue to have a positive outlook on our business, and we believe we'll see growth accelerate as we move throughout the year.  Our customers are increasing their drilling and completion activity behind our systems, and many have taken steps to strengthen their balance sheets and enhance their capital position to execute their growth plans.  In addition, we are encouraged by the level of commercial activity we are seeing, and we are evaluating a number of opportunities around our existing system footprints and in new basins."
2017 Financial Guidance 
SMLP is reaffirming its 2017 financial guidance with adjusted EBITDA expected to range from $295.0 million to $315.0 million and an annualized fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA run rate between $325.0 million and $345.0 million.  
SMLP expects to incur $100.0 million to $150.0 million of capex in 2017, including maintenance capex of $15.0 million to $20.0 million.  SMLP's 2017 capex guidance reflects the inclusion of our contributions to equity method investees.  SMLP expects full year distribution coverage will range from 1.15x to 1.25x.

Utica Shale
The Utica Shale reportable segment includes our 40% ownership interest in Ohio Gathering, a natural gas gathering system in service and under development spanning the condensate, liquids-rich and dry gas windows of the Utica Shale in Harrison, Guernsey, Noble, Belmont and Monroe counties in southeastern Ohio.  Segment adjusted EBITDA for the Utica Shale includes our proportional share of adjusted EBITDA from Ohio Gathering, based on a one-month lag.  The Utica Shale reportable segment also includes Summit Utica, the natural gas gathering system we operate which is currently in service and under development in Belmont and Monroe counties in southeastern Ohio.  Summit Utica gathers and delivers dry natural gas to interconnections with a third-party intrastate pipeline which provides access to the Clarington Hub.  
Segment adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 totaled $17.0 million, up 9.0% from $15.6 million for the prior-year period, primarily due to significantly higher volume throughput across Summit Utica, partially offset by lower volume throughput on Ohio Gathering and lower stabilization revenue at Ohio Condensate.  Volume throughput on the Ohio Gathering system, which is based on a one-month lag, averaged 769 MMcf/d, gross, in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 870 MMcf/d, gross, in the prior-year period and 848 MMcf/d, gross, in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Volume throughput on Ohio Gathering in the first quarter of 2017 was impacted by natural declines from existing wells on the system.  
Ohio Gathering commissioned the Larew Compressor Station in March 2017 which is expected to facilitate incremental dry gas production beginning in the second quarter of 2017, and generates an incremental compression fee on all dry gas volumes.  Currently, our customers are running five drilling rigs across the Ohio Gathering footprint, and we expect to see the volume benefit from this activity beginning in the second half of 2017.  
Volume throughput on the Summit Utica system averaged 275 MMcf/d in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 132 MMcf/d in the prior-year period and 211 MMcf/d in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Volume throughput for the first quarter of 2017 increased relative to the prior-year period due to our continued buildout of the Summit Utica gathering system and our connection of 23 new wells throughout 2016 and another four new wells during the first quarter of 2017.  We expect volumes on Summit Utica will continue to grow throughout the balance of the year as new wells located on new and existing pad sites are completed.  
In April 2017, we commissioned a new project to offload capacity constrained natural gas from a third-party gathering system adjacent to the Summit Utica system.  We expect this project to significantly increase volumes on Summit Utica beginning in the second quarter of 2017, albeit at a lower gathering rate, given that we are providing high-pressure gathering and compression services and not low-pressure wellhead gathering services. 
Williston Basin 
The Bison Midstream, Polar and Divide and Tioga Midstream systems provide our midstream services for the Williston Basin reportable segment.  Bison Midstream gathers associated natural gas production in Mountrail and Burke counties in North Dakota and delivers to third-party pipelines serving a third-party processing plant in Channahon, Illinois.  The Polar and Divide system gathers crude oil production in Williams and Divide counties in North Dakota and delivers to the COLT and Basin Transload rail terminals, as well as other third-party, intra- and interstate pipelines.  The Polar and Divide system also gathers and delivers produced water to various third-party disposal wells in the region.  Tioga Midstream is a crude oil, produced water and associated natural gas gathering system in Williams County, North Dakota.  All crude oil and natural gas gathered on the Tioga Midstream system is delivered to third-party pipelines, and all produced water is delivered to third-party disposal wells.
Segment adjusted EBITDA for the Williston Basin segment totaled $17.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $19.7 million for the prior-year period.  Compared to the prior-year period, first quarter 2017 volumes were negatively impacted due to a minimal number of new wells being commissioned behind our gathering systems during the first quarter of 2017.  In addition to lower volumes, a certain Williston customer has gathering rates that reset up or down annually, based on actual volumes delivered, relative to a pre-determined schedule.  The higher gathering rates that we enjoyed for this particular customer in the first quarter of 2016 were lowered in the second half of 2016 and impacted our sequential quarterly and year-over-year comparisons for this segment.  Without any new drilling activity in 2017, we would expect to see gathering rates for this particular customer to reset higher in 2018.  The Williston Basin segment benefitted from the recognition of $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 related to the settlement of a business interruption insurance claim associated with the temporary suspension of produced water gathering activities in 2015.    
Liquids volumes averaged 76.4 Mbbl/d in the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 19.6% over the prior-year period and a decrease of 7.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.  Lower liquids volumes were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the Polar and Divide system as no new wells were commissioned during the quarter.  Certain of our customers remain active across the Polar and Divide system, with three drilling rigs currently working and adding to an existing backlog of more than 40 drilled uncompleted wells ("DUCs") currently behind our Williston gathering systems.  We expect many of these DUCs to begin to be commissioned over the next several months following the start-up of new, third-party, long-haul takeaway pipeline.
Associated natural gas volumes averaged 17 MMcf/d in the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 32% over the prior-year period and flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.  Volume declines were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the Bison Midstream and Tioga Midstream systems as only three new wells were connected during the quarter.  In addition, the severe winter weather experienced late in the fourth quarter of 2016 continued into the beginning of 2017 and negatively impacted volumes during the quarter relative to the prior-year period.     
Piceance/DJ Basins 
The Grand River and the Niobrara G&P systems provide our midstream services for the Piceance/DJ Basins reportable segment.  These systems provide natural gas gathering and processing services for producers operating in the Piceance Basin located in western Colorado and eastern Utah and in the Denver-Julesburg ("DJ") Basin located in northeastern Colorado.  
Segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $29.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 16.8% from $24.8 million for the prior-year period.  First quarter 2017 volume throughput averaged 615 MMcf/d, an increase of 7.5% from 572 MMcf/d in the prior-year period and flat with the fourth quarter of 2016.  Volume growth relative to the prior-year period was primarily due to ongoing drilling and completion activity from our single-basin focused, private equity-backed customers.  These customers commissioned dozens of new wells across our Piceance and DJ Basin gathering systems in 2016, and in the first quarter of 2017, these customers commissioned another 31 new wells.  This activity was partially offset by the impact of our anchor customer's continued suspension of drilling activities in the basin and the resulting natural declines from existing production.  This impact of our anchor customer's volume declines was partially offset by higher minimum volume commitment ("MVC") shortfall payment adjustments associated with our gas gathering agreements.  Certain of our customers remain active across our Piceance and DJ gathering systems with three drilling rigs currently working. 
Barnett Shale 
The DFW Midstream system provides our midstream services for the Barnett Shale reportable segment.  This system gathers and delivers low-pressure natural gas received from pad sites, primarily located in southeastern Tarrant County, Texas, to downstream intrastate pipelines serving various natural gas hubs in the region.  
Segment adjusted EBITDA for the Barnett Shale segment totaled $12.1 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 14.1% from the prior-year period.  Volume throughput of 286 MMcf/d in the first quarter of 2017 was down 16.1% compared to the prior-year period average of 341 MMcf/d and flat with the fourth quarter of 2016.  No new wells were commissioned behind the DFW gathering system in the first quarter of 2017, but drilling activity behind the system has recently increased with two rigs added to the field since the end of the first quarter of 2017 and workover rigs returning several dormant wells to service late in the first quarter of 2017.  This increased level of activity is largely due to the customer turnover we've experienced behind the system in the last several quarters, and we expect that it will lead to increasing volumes in the second half of 2017.
Marcellus Shale 
The Mountaineer Midstream system provides our midstream services for the Marcellus Shale reportable segment. This system gathers high-pressure natural gas received from upstream pipeline interconnections with Antero Midstream Partners, LP and Crestwood Equity Partners LP.  Natural gas on the Mountaineer Midstream system is delivered to the Sherwood Processing Complex located in Doddridge County, West Virginia.  
Segment adjusted EBITDA for the Marcellus Shale segment totaled $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 22.8% from $4.6 million for the prior-year period, primarily due to $1.2 million of right-of-way repair expenses incurred in the prior-year period.  Volume throughput for this segment averaged 434 MMcf/d in the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 4.2% from 453 MMcf/d in the prior-year period, and an increase of 16.0% from the 374 MMcf/d in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Volume throughput increased relative to the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of our customer commissioning new wells behind our system.  We expect our customer to continue to complete its inventory of DUCs behind the Mountaineer Midstream system throughout the balance of the year which we expect will drive volumes higher, particularly in the second half of 2017.  
MVC Shortfall Payments 
SMLP billed its customers $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 related to MVCs.  For those customers that do not have credit banking mechanisms in their gathering agreements, or do not have the ability to use MVC shortfall payments as credits, the MVC shortfall payments are accounted for as gathering revenue in the period that they are earned.  For the first quarter of 2017, SMLP recognized $45.4 million of gathering revenue associated with MVC shortfall payments from certain customers in the Marcellus Shale, Piceance/DJ Basins, Williston Basin and Barnett Shale reportable segments.  Of this amount, $37.7 million was related to a certain Williston Basin customer with whom we entered into a gathering agreement amendment during the first quarter of 2017.  Pursuant to the amendment, the customer forfeited its MVC credit bank, which had been recorded on SMLP's balance sheet in prior periods as deferred revenue.  
MVC shortfall payment adjustments in the first quarter of 2017 totaled ($28.6) million and included ($38.5) million of deferred revenue related to MVC shortfall payments and $9.8 million related to MVC shortfall payment adjustments from certain customers in the Piceance/DJ Basins, Williston Basin and Barnett Shale reportable segments. 
SMLP's MVC shortfall payment mechanisms contributed $16.8 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017.

Capital Expenditures 
SMLP recorded total capital expenditures of $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, including $4.9 million of contributions to equity method investees.  Maintenance capital expenditures for the quarter totaled approximately $2.2 million.  Development activities during the first quarter of 2017 were primarily related to the ongoing expansion of our Summit Utica natural gas gathering system as well as the continued development of certain pipeline and compression expansion projects in the Piceance/DJ Basins segment.  
Capital & Liquidity
As of March 31, 2017, SMLP had $775.0 million of available borrowing capacity under its $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, subject to covenant limits.  Based upon the terms of SMLP's revolving credit facility and total outstanding debt of $1.275 billion (inclusive of $800.0 million of senior unsecured notes), SMLP's leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) as of March 31, 2017 was 4.35 to 1.0. 
Through March 31, 2017, the upper limit of SMLP's leverage ratio financial covenant was 5.00 to 1.0.  The leverage ratio upper limit can be permanently increased from 5.00 to 1.0 to 5.50 to 1.0 any time, at SMLP's option, subject to the inclusion of a senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) upper limit of 3.75 to 1.00.  
In February 2017, SMLP's wholly owned subsidiary, Summit Midstream Holdings, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Summit Midstream Finance Corp., co-issued $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2025.  The notes priced at par to yield 5.75%.  The net proceeds from the offering were used to tender and redeem all of our 7.50% senior notes originally due in 2021 (including accrued interest), and repay $172.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  SMLP incurred $17.9 million of cash expenses related to the tender and redemption of our 7.50% senior notes.  
Deferred Purchase Price Obligation
The consideration for the 2016 Drop Down consisted of (i) an initial $360.0 million cash payment (the "Initial Payment") which was funded on March 3, 2016 with borrowings under SMLP's revolving credit facility and (ii) a deferred payment which will be paid no later than December 31, 2020 (the "Deferred Purchase Price Obligation" or the "Deferred Payment," as defined below).  At the discretion of the board of directors of SMLP's general partner, the Deferred Payment can be made in either cash or SMLP common units, or a combination thereof.
The Deferred Payment will be equal to: (a) six-and-one-half (6.5) multiplied by the average Business Adjusted EBITDA of the 2016 Drop Down Assets for 2018 and 2019; less (b) the Initial Payment; less (c) all capital expenditures incurred for the 2016 Drop Down Assets between March 3, 2016 and December 31, 2019; plus (d) all Business Adjusted EBITDA from the 2016 Drop Down Assets between March 3, 2016 and December 31, 2019.  SMLP currently estimates that the Deferred Payment will be approximately $800.0 million to $900.0 million.  
Quarterly Distribution
On April 27, 2017, the board of directors of SMLP's general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.575 per unit on all of its outstanding common units, or $2.30 per unit on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  This quarterly distribution remains unchanged from the previous quarter and from the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  This distribution will be paid on May 15, 2017, to unitholders of record as of the close of business on May 8, 2017.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We also present adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, each a non-GAAP financial measure.  We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss, plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, our proportional adjusted EBITDA for equity method investees, adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments, unit-based and noncash compensation, Deferred Purchase Price Obligation expense, early extinguishment of debt expense, impairments and other noncash expenses or losses, less interest income, income tax benefit, income (loss) from equity method investees and other noncash income or gains.  We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA plus cash interest received and cash taxes received, less cash interest paid, senior notes interest adjustment, cash taxes paid and maintenance capital expenditures.  Because adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other entities in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby diminishing their utility.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our financial performance. Furthermore, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may provide external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of our core ongoing business.
Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are used as supplemental financial measures by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others.
Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess:

the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness; 
the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; 
our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other entities in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; 
the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; and 
the financial performance of our assets without regard to (i) income or loss from equity method investees, (ii) the impact of the timing of minimum volume commitments shortfall payments under our gathering agreements or (iii) the timing of impairments or other noncash income or expense items. 

Distributable cash flow is used to assess:

the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make future cash distributions and 
the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. 

Both of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example: 

certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity's financial performance, such as an entity's cost of capital and tax structure; 
adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and 
although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

We compensate for the limitations of adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP financial measures, understanding the differences between the financial measures and incorporating these data points into our decision-making process. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are attached to this press release.
We do not provide the GAAP financial measures of net income or loss or net cash provided by operating activities on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including, but not limited to, (i) income or loss from equity method investees, (ii) deferred purchase price obligation income or expense and (iii) asset impairments.  These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.  As such, any associated estimate and its impact on our GAAP performance and cash flow measures could vary materially based on a variety of acceptable management assumptions.
