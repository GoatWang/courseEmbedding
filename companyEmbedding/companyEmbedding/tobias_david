Item Description: Taylor Francis Inc, United States, 2011. Hardback. Book Condition: New. 3rd Revised edition. Language: English . Brand New Book. Since the publication of the second edition of Applied Reliability in 1995, the ready availability of inexpensive, powerful statistical software has changed the way statisticians and engineers look at and analyze all kinds of data. Problems in reliability that were once difficult and time consuming even for experts can now be solved with a few well-chosen clicks of a mouse. However, software documentation has had difficulty keeping up with the enhanced functionality added to new releases, especially in specialized areas such as reliability analysis. Using analysis capabilities in spreadsheet software and two well-maintained, supported, and frequently updated, popular software packages-Minitab and SAS JMP-the third edition of Applied Reliability is an easy-to-use guide to basic descriptive statistics, reliability concepts, and the properties of lifetime distributions such as the exponential, Weibull, and lognormal. The material covers reliability data plotting, acceleration models, life test data analysis, systems models, and much more. The third edition includes a new chapter on Bayesian reliability analysis and expanded, updated coverage of repairable system modeling. Taking a practical and example-oriented approach to reliability analysis, this book provides detailed illustrations of software implementation throughout and more than 150 worked-out examples done with JMP, Minitab, and several spreadsheet programs. In addition, there are nearly 300 figures, hundreds of exercises, and additional problems at the end of each chapter, and new material throughout. Software and other files are available for download online.  Bookseller Inventory # AA69781584884668

Features

Presents a practical and example-oriented approach suitable for engineering students, statisticians, and professionals from a variety of disciplines
Includes implementation of the methods using statistical software
Emphasizes the powerful methodology of MLE
Provides detailed graphical explanations of methods
Provides auxiliary materials online 

Summary
Since the publication of the second edition of Applied Reliability in 1995, the ready availability of inexpensive, powerful statistical software has changed the way statisticians and engineers look at and analyze all kinds of data. Problems in reliability that were once difficult and time consuming even for experts can now be solved with a few well-chosen clicks of a mouse. However, software documentation has had difficulty keeping up with the enhanced functionality added to new releases, especially in specialized areas such as reliability analysis.

Using analysis capabilities in spreadsheet software and two well-maintained, supported, and frequently updated, popular software packages—Minitab and SAS JMP—the third edition of Applied Reliability is an easy-to-use guide to basic descriptive statistics, reliability concepts, and the properties of lifetime distributions such as the exponential, Weibull, and lognormal. The material covers reliability data plotting, acceleration models, life test data analysis, systems models, and much more. The third edition includes a new chapter on Bayesian reliability analysis and expanded, updated coverage of repairable system modeling. 

Taking a practical and example-oriented approach to reliability analysis, this book provides detailed illustrations of software implementation throughout and more than 150 worked-out examples done with JMP, Minitab, and several spreadsheet programs. In addition, there are nearly 300 figures, hundreds of exercises, and additional problems at the end of each chapter, and new material throughout. Software and other files are available for download online

Reviews
"I have used the second edition of this book for an Introduction to Reliability course for over 15 years. … The third edition … retains the features I liked about the second edition. In addition, it includes improved graphics … [and] examples of popular software used in industry … There is a new chapter on Bayesian reliability and additional material on reliability data plotting, and repairable systems’ analysis. … The book does a good and comprehensive job of explaining the basic reliability concepts; types of data encountered in practice and how to treat this data; reliability data plotting; and the common probability distributions used in reliability work, including motivations for their use and practical areas of application. … an excellent choice for a first course in reliability. The book also does a good job of explaining more advanced topics … the book will continue to be a popular desk reference in industry and a textbook for advanced undergraduate or first-year graduate students."—Journal of the American Statistical Association, June 2014
