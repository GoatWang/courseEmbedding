History[edit]
The band was formed in 1979 by school friends Steven ('Steve') Kent (guitar), Michael Fitzsimons ('Micky Fitz') (vocals), Nicholas ('Nick') Cunningham (drums) and Martin Smith (bass).[2] They played their first gig in front of friends in February 1980, and after taking on Lol Pryor as manager, began performing more often. The band's first release was the song "Out in the Cold" on the A Sudden Surge of Sound compilation album.[2] They played their first Oi! concert in 1981, supporting The 4-Skins, and they became closely associated with the Oi! scene from then on.[2] While the Oi! movement was labelled as far right and racist (despite the fact that several Oi! bands played at Rock Against Racism concerts), The Business took a stance against political extremism with their Oi Against Racism and Political Extremism ...But Still Against The System tour.[3]
In November 1981, they released their debut single, "Harry May", which spent over three months in the UK Indie Chart, reaching No. 13. The initial line-up split up in late 1981, with Kent, Cunningham, and Smith forming Q-Bow, but Fitz carried on with Pryor, recruiting Graham Ball on guitar, Mark Brennan and Steve Whale from The Blackout, and John Fisher on drums.[2] The new line-up made their live debut in January 1982, after which Ball and Fisher departed, leaving the band as a four-piece, with Kev Boyce of The Blackout on drums.[2] The new line-up recorded the Smash the Discos EP, which was a No. 3 indie hit, and after a short tour, they recorded their debut album, which was to be called Loud, Proud, and Punk. The master tapes for the album went missing after disagreements between the band's label and the studio, forcing them to re-record the album, which was released as Suburban Rebels in May 1983.[2] The album was remixed by their label, Secret, without them knowing, and Secret's financial difficulties limited promotion of the album. Frustrated by this, the band split up, with The Business members forming short-lived bands Chapter and Sabre Dance.[2]
Pryor issued a retrospective album consisting of demos and live tracks on his Syndicate label, the success of which prompted the band to reform and record a what was to be marketed as a live album, Loud, Proud, and Punk. It was actually recorded in a studio, with crowd noise dubbed in later.[2] Pryor renamed his record label Wonderful World and issued several Business albums in late 1985, with the Drinking and Driving tour following. The name of the tour caused controversy, with tabloid journalists accusing the band of condoning drunk-driving, although the title was tongue-in-cheek.[2]
In late 1986, Brennan and Pryor founded Link Records, and with Brennan becoming increasingly busy running the label, the band split up again. In 1992, Fitz performed a few songs guesting with The Elite and he reformed the band to play a benefit concert for Bobby Moore, who had recently died of cancer. Brennan later started a new record label, Captain Oi! Records and did not join the reformed band. The band's line-up then became Micky Fitz (singer), Steve Whale (guitar), Lol Proctor (bass) and Micky Fairbairn (drums). The band released a new single "Anywhere But Here" and new album Keep The Faith in 1994. After a number of tours in Western Europe, the band played their first gigs in America in August 1994. In 1997 The Business released The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But The Truth which was produced by Lars Frederiksen from Rancid. In 2000, the band joined together with Dropkick Murphys to release Mob Mentality. The band's final studio album, No Mercy For You was released in 2001. Their biggest hit song in recent times, "England 5 - Germany 1", (based on the result of a World Cup Qualifying match in 2001), became a football anthem for England and even appeared in the 2004 teen comedy EuroTrip. Despite various line up changes, the band's popularity continued to grow.
By 2006 Micky had rebuilt his band after overcoming his alcoholism, this year saw the band take on a 2 month tour of the USA with the line up Micky Fitz (singer), Robin Guy (drums), Daniel (guitar) and what would become long serving Trots (bass). In September of 2006 Micky recruited long time friend Tosh (of Section 5) to play guitar, shortly followed by Bundie on drums. The band took to the studio in Berlin and recorded three covers, this session featured Mitch Harris of Napalm Death guesting to record the title track 'Mean Girl', originally by one of Micky's favourite bands Status Quo. This was released by Bad Dog records as an EP, the B side being a live set recorded at the legendary Marquee Club in London from 1982.
Led by a reinvigorated Micky Fitz the band continued to tour incessantly and broke new ground as the first British Oi! band to play in Chile in 2008, they also visited Australia and New Zealand alongside extensive European and US tours. As well as their touring they also returned to the studio and put out a split 7" with Control. The Mean Girl recordings and Marquee Tapes were combined with the split and a recording from Full Force Festival to make the US mini album 'Doing The Business'
In 2010 Tosh departed the band and after a short stint with rocker Johny Skullknuckles the band's final line up was completed with Fish (of The Skeptix, Discharge and Demon) taking over on six string duties. Around this time the band had taken to the studio to record what would be their last release, 'Back in The Day', it saw the studio return of original guitarist and principal songwriter Steve Kent who performed guitar and backing vocals on the recording. The 7" was eventually released on Randale Records and Sailors Grave Records in 2014.
The band continued on their way, returning to South America to play Sao Paulo, taking on a headline tour of Australia and New Zealand, (with visits to Singapore and Bangkok along the way) and made a triumphant return to Japan in 2014, with a quick visit to South Korea while they were in the area!
In the summer of 2015 Micky was diagnosed with cancer, as with his life he met the challenge head on and refused to let the public know of his diagnosis until after he had completed the final run of shows. This last run in Europe were classic Business concerts, with Micky relentlessly defying his condition to give the fans 100%
The band performed what would be their final show in October 2015 in Badalona, Spain.
Death of Micky Fitz[edit]
In late 2015, Micky Fitz was diagnosed with cancer on the lymph gland and underwent radiotherapy. On 1 December 2016 it was announced that Fitz had died.[4]

History[edit]
The band was formed in 1979 by school friends Steven ('Steve') Kent (guitar), Michael Fitzsimons ('Micky Fitz') (vocals), Nicholas ('Nick') Cunningham (drums) and Martin Smith (bass).[2] They played their first gig in front of friends in February 1980, and after taking on Lol Pryor as manager, began performing more often. The band's first release was the song "Out in the Cold" on the A Sudden Surge of Sound compilation album.[2] They played their first Oi! concert in 1981, supporting The 4-Skins, and they became closely associated with the Oi! scene from then on.[2] While the Oi! movement was labelled as far right and racist (despite the fact that several Oi! bands played at Rock Against Racism concerts), The Business took a stance against political extremism with their Oi Against Racism and Political Extremism ...But Still Against The System tour.[3]

The band continued on their way, returning to South America to play Sao Paulo, taking on a headline tour of Australia and New Zealand, (with visits to Singapore and Bangkok along the way) and made a triumphant return to Japan in 2014, with a quick visit to South Korea while they were in the area!

History[edit]
The band was formed in 1979 by school friends Steven ('Steve') Kent (guitar), Michael Fitzsimons ('Micky Fitz') (vocals), Nicholas ('Nick') Cunningham (drums) and Martin Smith (bass).[2] They played their first gig in front of friends in February 1980, and after taking on Lol Pryor as manager, began performing more often. The band's first release was the song "Out in the Cold" on the A Sudden Surge of Sound compilation album.[2] They played their first Oi! concert in 1981, supporting The 4-Skins, and they became closely associated with the Oi! scene from then on.[2] While the Oi! movement was labelled as far right and racist (despite the fact that several Oi! bands played at Rock Against Racism concerts), The Business took a stance against political extremism with their Oi Against Racism and Political Extremism ...But Still Against The System tour.[3]
In November 1981, they released their debut single, "Harry May", which spent over three months in the UK Indie Chart, reaching No. 13. The initial line-up split up in late 1981, with Kent, Cunningham, and Smith forming Q-Bow, but Fitz carried on with Pryor, recruiting Graham Ball on guitar, Mark Brennan and Steve Whale from The Blackout, and John Fisher on drums.[2] The new line-up made their live debut in January 1982, after which Ball and Fisher departed, leaving the band as a four-piece, with Kev Boyce of The Blackout on drums.[2] The new line-up recorded the Smash the Discos EP, which was a No. 3 indie hit, and after a short tour, they recorded their debut album, which was to be called Loud, Proud, and Punk. The master tapes for the album went missing after disagreements between the band's label and the studio, forcing them to re-record the album, which was released as Suburban Rebels in May 1983.[2] The album was remixed by their label, Secret, without them knowing, and Secret's financial difficulties limited promotion of the album. Frustrated by this, the band split up, with The Business members forming short-lived bands Chapter and Sabre Dance.[2]
Pryor issued a retrospective album consisting of demos and live tracks on his Syndicate label, the success of which prompted the band to reform and record a what was to be marketed as a live album, Loud, Proud, and Punk. It was actually recorded in a studio, with crowd noise dubbed in later.[2] Pryor renamed his record label Wonderful World and issued several Business albums in late 1985, with the Drinking and Driving tour following. The name of the tour caused controversy, with tabloid journalists accusing the band of condoning drunk-driving, although the title was tongue-in-cheek.[2]
In late 1986, Brennan and Pryor founded Link Records, and with Brennan becoming increasingly busy running the label, the band split up again. In 1992, Fitz performed a few songs guesting with The Elite and he reformed the band to play a benefit concert for Bobby Moore, who had recently died of cancer. Brennan later started a new record label, Captain Oi! Records and did not join the reformed band. The band's line-up then became Micky Fitz (singer), Steve Whale (guitar), Lol Proctor (bass) and Micky Fairbairn (drums). The band released a new single "Anywhere But Here" and new album Keep The Faith in 1994. After a number of tours in Western Europe, the band played their first gigs in America in August 1994. In 1997 The Business released The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But The Truth which was produced by Lars Frederiksen from Rancid. In 2000, the band joined together with Dropkick Murphys to release Mob Mentality. The band's final studio album, No Mercy For You was released in 2001. Their biggest hit song in recent times, "England 5 - Germany 1", (based on the result of a World Cup Qualifying match in 2001), became a football anthem for England and even appeared in the 2004 teen comedy EuroTrip. Despite various line up changes, the band's popularity continued to grow.
By 2006 Micky had rebuilt his band after overcoming his alcoholism, this year saw the band take on a 2 month tour of the USA with the line up Micky Fitz (singer), Robin Guy (drums), Daniel (guitar) and what would become long serving Trots (bass). In September of 2006 Micky recruited long time friend Tosh (of Section 5) to play guitar, shortly followed by Bundie on drums. The band took to the studio in Berlin and recorded three covers, this session featured Mitch Harris of Napalm Death guesting to record the title track 'Mean Girl', originally by one of Micky's favourite bands Status Quo. This was released by Bad Dog records as an EP, the B side being a live set recorded at the legendary Marquee Club in London from 1982.
Led by a reinvigorated Micky Fitz the band continued to tour incessantly and broke new ground as the first British Oi! band to play in Chile in 2008, they also visited Australia and New Zealand alongside extensive European and US tours. As well as their touring they also returned to the studio and put out a split 7" with Control. The Mean Girl recordings and Marquee Tapes were combined with the split and a recording from Full Force Festival to make the US mini album 'Doing The Business'
In 2010 Tosh departed the band and after a short stint with rocker Johny Skullknuckles the band's final line up was completed with Fish (of The Skeptix, Discharge and Demon) taking over on six string duties. Around this time the band had taken to the studio to record what would be their last release, 'Back in The Day', it saw the studio return of original guitarist and principal songwriter Steve Kent who performed guitar and backing vocals on the recording. The 7" was eventually released on Randale Records and Sailors Grave Records in 2014.
The band continued on their way, returning to South America to play Sao Paulo, taking on a headline tour of Australia and New Zealand, (with visits to Singapore and Bangkok along the way) and made a triumphant return to Japan in 2014, with a quick visit to South Korea while they were in the area!
In the summer of 2015 Micky was diagnosed with cancer, as with his life he met the challenge head on and refused to let the public know of his diagnosis until after he had completed the final run of shows. This last run in Europe were classic Business concerts, with Micky relentlessly defying his condition to give the fans 100%
The band performed what would be their final show in October 2015 in Badalona, Spain.
Death of Micky Fitz[edit]
In late 2015, Micky Fitz was diagnosed with cancer on the lymph gland and underwent radiotherapy. On 1 December 2016 it was announced that Fitz had died.[4]

History[edit]
The band was formed in 1979 by school friends Steven ('Steve') Kent (guitar), Michael Fitzsimons ('Micky Fitz') (vocals), Nicholas ('Nick') Cunningham (drums) and Martin Smith (bass).[2] They played their first gig in front of friends in February 1980, and after taking on Lol Pryor as manager, began performing more often. The band's first release was the song "Out in the Cold" on the A Sudden Surge of Sound compilation album.[2] They played their first Oi! concert in 1981, supporting The 4-Skins, and they became closely associated with the Oi! scene from then on.[2] While the Oi! movement was labelled as far right and racist (despite the fact that several Oi! bands played at Rock Against Racism concerts), The Business took a stance against political extremism with their Oi Against Racism and Political Extremism ...But Still Against The System tour.[3]

The band continued on their way, returning to South America to play Sao Paulo, taking on a headline tour of Australia and New Zealand, (with visits to Singapore and Bangkok along the way) and made a triumphant return to Japan in 2014, with a quick visit to South Korea while they were in the area!
In the summer of 2015 Micky was diagnosed with cancer, as with his life he met the challenge head on and refused to let the public know of his diagnosis until after he had completed the final run of shows. This last run in Europe were classic Business concerts, with Micky relentlessly defying his condition to give the fans 100%
The band performed what would be their final show in October 2015 in Badalona, Spain.
Death of Micky Fitz[edit]
In late 2015, Micky Fitz was diagnosed with cancer on the lymph gland and underwent radiotherapy. On 1 December 2016 it was announced that Fitz had died.[4]

High-Tech Meal Delivery

Singer recently helped Reading Hospital take its meal delivery service to a whole new level. Instead of having the staff run back and forth to the kitchen, robots are now doing much of the transport. They carry trays of food from the kitchen to the nutrition staff over two blocks away. The robots ride the elevator alone and navigate through the hallways on pre-programmed routes without bumping in to anyone. Singer supplied the carts that the robots ride on, traveling 18 miles a day.
Watch them in action on wfmz.com by clicking  HERE. 



A Great Job at Doing Good

Singer salesperson, Cliff Baker, saw a need in his community after Hurricane Sandy and set out to fill it. He and Mike Jurusz of Chef Mike’s ABG in Seaside Park, NJ, started an organization to provide Thanksgiving meals to those in need and those who came to help the community rebuild.  From 350 meals that first Thanksgiving, the organization has grown to feeding 1500 Thanksgiving and Christmas meals in 2016. If There is a Need, We Will Feed includes 50 volunteers, 75 drivers and numerous restaurants and organizations which donate food and distribute the meals. A Toys for Tots component was added for this year’s Christmas donation.
More info on this organization and the companies which support it can be found HERE. 



Thanksgiving Food Drive

Singer employees recently participated in an annual food drive to support families in need.

Time To Invest In Equipment: Congress Gives Small Businesses A Permanent Tax Break 
01/06/2016

At year’s end, the foodservice equipment industry and its customers received a gift that keeps on giving. After years of late-minute uncertainty on whether Congress would renew the deal that many business owners rely on to finance their big-ticket purchases, Washington got its act together in December and passed a mammoth tax bill providing small businesses a permanent tax break on buying equipment.The much-anticipated Section 179 deduction locks in a large tax break for small-business capital investments  that has been temporary until now. In addition, a bonus 50% deduction has been locked in through 2019, businesses of all sizes to depreciate half the cost of equipment acquired and put in service during 2015, 2016 and 2017.The provision makes it more affordable for small companies to buy up to $500,000 a year worth of equipment, ranging from computers to vehicles to reach-in refrigeration and ranges. The purchases can be written off immediately on a business’ taxes instead of being depreciated over a number of years. While most equipment that small businesses lease, finance or purchase will qualify for the Section 179 Deduction, there are some exceptions, such as air conditioning or heating equipment and property used outside the United States. Information on qualifying capital items can be found here.The deduction is essentially limited to small and midsize companies. It begins phasing out when a company spends more than $2 million a year on qualifying purchases, and is eliminated entirely for those that spend more than $2.5 million.Section 179 was once a fairly limited tax break, with an annual cap of $25,000 or less. But starting in 2003, Congress began a series of temporary increases, each requiring annual reauthorization to prevent the cap from returning to $25,000. From now on, operators and small business owners can plan ahead. The 233-page tax deal, signed by President Obama, permanently sets the Section 179 cap at $500,000, subject to inflation adjustments.
 

COSME Named #1 New Restaurant in NYC
  
    Congratulations to Cosme on being named the 2015 #1 new restaurant in New York by the New York Times!   Singer is proud to have participated in this project through its New York division. The M Tucker team of Joe Steckmeister and Dennis DeCicco worked closely with Chef Enrique Olvera and Chef de Cuisine Daniela Soto-Innes to assist with the kitchen design, equipment procurement and installation of the kitchen equipment.  The team of Morgan Tucker and Silena Mejia helped design and provide the tabletop and also procured the kitchen supplies for the new restaurant.  We are thrilled for Cosme’s success and recognition!





    Morgan Tucker, of Singer’s New York division, has been named Chairperson of the New York City Branch of the American Institute of Wine and Food for 2016.

Together, we have 46 territory sales consultants and a fleet of 45 trucks providing daily deliveries from Connecticut to Maryland.






    M Tucker was featured on the CNBC program, Consumed: The Real Restaurant Business,  Season 1, Episode 107 which aired on 6/24/15. The show follows the ups and downs of three different restaurants in New York. Tucker’s Joe Steckmeister and Marc Fuchs were shown in a segment about The Meatball Shop, discussing the moving of kitchen equipment. After working with Tucker, The Meatball Shop’s owner, Daniel Holzman, said "M Tucker is ... one of the best in the business."    



   If you just want to watch the Tucker segment of this episode, fast forward to 26:26 on the video. Congrats to Marc and Joe on a job well done.



A Fond Farewell
  
    On May 28th, Tucker employees gathered at an after-work reception to honor Stephen Tucker. Stephen retired after 40+ years of service to pursue new business opportunities. Many co-workers thanked Stephen for the influence he’s had on their lives and careers. Family members and friends from the industry were also on hand.  Stephen’s energy, enthusiasm and humor were contagious. We will all miss him. As he embarks on his new endeavors, we wish him the very best.

United Way Awards
  
    Singer recently received three awards from the United Way of Berks County for its 2014 campaign. For the second time in three years, Singer was awarded Outstanding Employee Campaign for companies with 101-499 employees. This award is presented to organizations that best exemplify the spirit of voluntary giving and that have put forth the best effort in organizing employee campaigns to increase giving. We also earned an honorable mention in the Presidential Recognition Award based on the overall total of our donation. And for the first time ever, we reached the highest level of achievement for our individual giving. The Presidential Award is given to employee groups with a per capita donation of $250 or more.

Singer Trade Show
   Thanks to all our  customers who made time in their busy schedules to attend our 26th  annual trade show on Sunday, April 7th and Monday, April 8th.  It was our biggest show ever, with over 250 manufacturers on display. We had a  great turnout and everyone took advantage of the hundreds of 2-day-only show  specials. We’ll post next year’s dates as soon as they’re determined. It’s an  event not to be missed!

Happy 95th Birthday, Singer Equipment Company
