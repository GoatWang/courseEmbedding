New Position Strengthens Splunk’s Senior Leadership, Supporting the Company’s Aggressive Growth 
SAN FRANCISCO - April 11, 2011 - Splunk, a leading provider of operational intelligence software, today announced Leonard R. Stein has joined the company as senior vice president and general counsel, and will be responsible for overseeing all of Splunk's worldwide legal affairs. Stein will report directly to CEO Godfrey Sullivan.
"Lenny Stein brings to Splunk an outstanding background managing legal affairs for both public and private technology companies, from start-ups to billion dollar corporations," said Splunk CEO Godfrey Sullivan.

He also held senior legal and business positions at retail industry software and EDI provider QRS Corporation, software and services company Buzzsaw.com, and Preview Travel, a company that pioneered the online travel business. Stein handled Preview's 
$700 million merger with Travelocity in 2000.
