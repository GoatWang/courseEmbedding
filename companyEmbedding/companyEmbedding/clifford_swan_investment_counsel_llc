Preserve & Grow Wealth | Clifford Swan Investment Counselors













































Wisdom    for    Generations
 


We preserve and grow wealth. But that’s far from all we do, as each client has a story all their own.
Some have only good stories, such as reaping the rewards of a successful career.
Or helping a university endowment offer more scholarships.
Others are dealing with the bumps that come to many, from caring for special needs children to unexpectedly losing a life partner.
No matter the story, our ultimate duty is to provide a voice of reason for stewarding wealth.
Investment counseling is so much more than finances. It’s providing wisdom for generations.

Wisdom for Generations | Clifford Swan Investment Counselors
















































About
True to the vision of our founders













Clifford Swan Investment Counselors advises individuals, families and mid-sized institutions, crafting personalized strategies for wealth preservation and growth.  Completely independent, we employ a disciplined, long-term approach toward investment management.
To help our clients with both the responsibilities and the possibilities of significant wealth, we use our experience and expertise to collaboratively address issues of wealth transfer and family education.


























Our founding principles have served our clients well

A.M. Clifford, our founder, not only coined the term “investment counselor” in 1915, but provided the definition on which recognized fiduciary care standards are modeled. We have held firm, and continue to do so today, to the simple yet clear principle of holding a client’s best interests above all other considerations.


























Providing independent, unbiased advice created solely for your needs

Our investment counsel should reflect who you are, what you value and the life you want for you and your loved ones. To do so, we must gain a thorough understanding of your unique situation today, and stand ready to respond to changes in your life that can impact your investment strategy. We apply our internal research to your situation to create your recommended investment portfolio. That recommendation is conflict-free; we have no ties to, nor receive compensation from, any funds, stocks, bonds or outside parties. 
In this way, we remain true to the vision of our founders.

Managing Your Wealth | Clifford Swan Investment Counselors
















































Manage Wealth
More than investments alone













We take a holistic approach to your complete investment strategy. Most important is what we learn about you: what you value, the life you want to have for you and your loved ones, your vision of the future. These “soft” goals help us to determine “hard” figures such as the level of current income and liquidity required, your time horizon and tax considerations.
Clifford Swan views investment opportunities through the lens of wealth preservation (adjusted for inflation) and long-term results. Every portfolio we manage is judged by how well it delivers against your specific goals.
With your approval, we will gladly work with your other advisors, including tax and estate professionals, to gain a complete picture of your current assets. All we’ve learned is applied to the creation of your investment portfolio, and how you plan to use it. Only in this way can we build a truly personalized strategy.


























Advice that goes well beyond investments

Helping you manage your wealth is more than managing a portfolio. It is a truly collaborative process, and requires ongoing communication that includes face-to-face meetings and regular written communications, such as quarterly reports. But most of all it means a commitment to being there whenever you need us, with advice on financial matters above and beyond investing only. These include retirement planning; budgeting, especially for major acquisitions; estate preservation strategies; tax planning and even philanthropic advice on establishing foundations or charitable trusts.


























Working with other professionals

Because of our deep understanding of your financial situation and your personal goals, we can be of service to your trusted legal, tax and other professional advisors during significant life events or simply on an ongoing basis. For example, we can coordinate with your tax professional on losses and gains to minimize your overall tax consequences. In this way, we help simplify the management of all your finances.


























Educating family members

The responsibility of wealth is not automatically passed on with wealth itself. Like any skill—from learning to drive to practicing a profession—responsible management of personal wealth requires education. That can take place by learning from mistakes, or it can take place proactively, wisely and responsibly.
We offer both informal and formal education to the next generation—or any family member—to whom you will be endowing substantial wealth. We host events and webinars on specific subjects. Sometimes as simple as a meeting over coffee, our educational opportunities are always grounded in the reality of your particular situation. We know firsthand that the subject of finances can be fraught with emotion; but we have also seen that open discussion of this difficult subject goes a long way to fostering healthy family relationships.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Eaton Corporation, PLC (NYSE:ETN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 11 Hold Ratings, 7 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.32)Consensus Price Target: $77.83 (1.44% downside)

Preserve & Grow Wealth | Clifford Swan Investment Counselors













































Wisdom    for    Generations
 


We preserve and grow wealth. But that’s far from all we do, as each client has a story all their own.
Some have only good stories, such as reaping the rewards of a successful career.
Or helping a university endowment offer more scholarships.
Others are dealing with the bumps that come to many, from caring for special needs children to unexpectedly losing a life partner.
No matter the story, our ultimate duty is to provide a voice of reason for stewarding wealth.
Investment counseling is so much more than finances. It’s providing wisdom for generations.
