Private Wealth
Since our founding, we have specialized in portfolio management for individuals and families. We place the highest priority on our stewardship responsibility.  We would not choose an investment for our clients that we would not personally invest in ourselves.  Normally, Holderness maintains discretionary trading authority over the account and makes buy/sell decisions based on our research conclusions. 
One area of focus has been “multigenerational” investment management.  Legacy families have relied on us to help them preserve wealth for their entire family including children and grandchildren.  Many clients establish trusts to accomplish these goals, and we also aid in estate planning regarding best practices for wealth transfer to the next generation.   
Holderness can customize these investments based on a client’s specific requests (e.g., investing in a specific sector/stock). Client service is handled by the Holderness team, and we can cater to unique client needs through cash management or trading services. Clients are scheduled for reviews of their performance and investment goals, and may call our office at any time to discuss their accounts. Holderness will also maintain non-discretionary accounts for clients under this solution if they have existing investments they would like to hold.

Financial Advisors
At Holderness Investments, we partner with financial advisors to provide investment solutions for the advisor’s clients.  We provide strategies across custodial platforms, such as TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab, and select Broker-Dealers.
Investment Strategies:
 
Holderness Investments focuses on investment research and global market trends.  We compliment the work of the advisor by monitoring current market conditions, and making strategic changes as necessary.  Timely market commentary and educational information is provided to the advisor as a template for client reviews, or as a value-added piece that can be emailed.
Vision Tactical Strategies
 
These actively managed model portfolios are designed to utilize a strategic and diversified mix of asset classes to establish a core portfolio for the client. This solution is thematic and derived from our macroeconomic outlook. The portfolios are constructed in response to our overall market viewpoint, so that the allocation may take advantage of tactical opportunities within the various asset classes. Clients will be able to choose one of five portfolios based on their risk profile. The portfolios are dynamic in that rebalancing will be utilized to maintain target allocations. Each portfolio will hold a combination of ETFs and/or mutual funds.
Strategy Fact Sheets:  Updated 9/30/2015
 
Custom Portfolio Consulting
 
As an advisor, you run across prospects with a variety of financial needs.  Financial assets can range from cash values in insurance policies to a brokerage account full of stocks.  This last area is where we can help.  Many money managers require an advisor to “sell all” assets to fit into the manager’s model portfolio.  This may not be an advisable strategy if the client has large unrealized gains in the portfolio, thus triggering a taxable event.

We can review the client’s stock assets and discuss if there are changes that need to be made.  Our comprehensive research and analysis help to determine the intrinsic and relative value of each company; thereby, providing basis on whether or not to sell an existing position.  We can help manage taxes by offsetting gains and losses.  If there is a concentrated position, we can advise on risk control measures such as hedging or equity monetization.  Our goal would be to work with you and the client to monitor and manage the portfolio in the future in order to compliment the clients’ other assets.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NTS (NYSEMKT:NTS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
