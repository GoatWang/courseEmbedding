Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Harry Rosen Is Dead at 92; Junior's Restaurant Founder

By ERIC ASIMOVOCT. 11, 1996

Harry Rosen, who founded Junior's Restaurant, the Brooklyn institution renowned for cheesecake so rich and creamy it made tough men swoon, died yesterday at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 92.The cause was bladder cancer, said a son, Marvin Rosen.For almost 46 years, Junior's has anchored the intersection in downtown Brooklyn of Fulton Street, DeKalb Avenue and the Flatbush Avenue extension. The lively, brassy restaurant, whose orange booths and chairs could seat nearly 400 people, has been a magnet for politicians who came to make deals, journalists who came to meet politicians and moviegoers who came for refreshment. But above all, everyone came for the cheesecake.''It was perfect, it was the platonic cheesecake, as smooth as alabaster,'' said Michael Stern, who with his wife, Jane, writes about American regional foods. ''If you think of great cheesecake, you think of New York cheesecake, and when you wanted great cheesecake in New York, you went to Junior's.''When Mr. Rosen opened Junior's on Nov. 4, 1950, it quickly became the place to go before seeing a show at one of the downtown theaters, like the Albee, the Fox and the Strand. After a Dodgers game, people would travel to Junior's on the Flatbush Avenue trolley. Later, it became a hangout for Brooklyn politicians.

''Guys like Meade Esposito would go in there and make judges in the back room,'' the writer Pete Hamill said. Continue reading the main story

Even today, Junior's is an obligatory stop on the campaign trail. Bill Clinton ate cheesecake there in 1992, while Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn and the Rev. Al Sharpton are among those who believe flashbulbs are just another kind of icing on the cheesecake.Mr. Rosen was born in 1904 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. At 13, he dropped out of school to work as a soda jerk. Before long, he opened his own sandwich shop in Manhattan, the Enduro, named after the equipment company that provided him with stainless steel.Eventually, he owned five Enduro sandwich shops, four in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn, on the site of Junior's. In the 1930's, Mr. Rosen sold his Manhattan branches to concentrate on the Brooklyn Enduro.''It was a large bar with entertainment and a steakhouse,'' Marvin Rosen recalled. But after World War II, he said, his father decided he had to change with the times. He closed the Enduro, and after a year of renovation, Junior's was born.Mr. Rosen ran Junior's with his two sons, Marvin and Walter, a family arrangement that inspired the restaurant's name. ''Working with him was not a picnic,'' Marvin Rosen said. ''He was a tough, demanding man. He was a perfectionist.''He brought this perfectionist attitude to the creation of Junior's cheesecake, which he devised with the restaurant's head baker, Eigel Petersen.As Marvin Rosen remembers it, his father brought to Brooklyn cheesecakes he had tasted all over the country. ''My father was the type of man who, when he saw a product, would buy it and bring it back, even from Oshkosh, to examine it,'' he said.

While Junior's was a full-service restaurant, offering corned beef, steaks and seafood carried by its fast-talking waiters, cheesecake gradually became its signature dish.

And though Junior's is generally thought to be a product of earlier, more Runyonesque times, it was not until 1973, when Junior's won a cheesecake contest held by New York Magazine, that its claim to the world's cheesecake throne was finally made, Marvin Rosen said.Since then, Junior's has drawn a steady stream of tourists to Brooklyn for a taste, an exodus interrupted in 1981 by a fire that left the restaurant a scarred ruin. It took almost a year to repair, but, like an irrepressible souffle, Junior's rose again, reopening in 1982.Mr. Rosen retired in the mid-1970's, ceding control of the restaurant to his sons. Marvin and Walter Rosen now are turning the restaurant over to a third generation, Walter's sons, Kevin and Alan Rosen, who have added a mail-order cheesecake business.In addition to his two sons and two grandsons, Mr. Rosen is survived by his wife of 67 years, Ruth; a sister, Marcia, of Boca Raton, Fla.; seven other grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.Recipe of a Lifetime: Junior's Cheesecake1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar3 tablespoons sifted cornstarch30 ounces (3 3/4 large packages) cream cheese, softened1 large egg1/2 cup heavy (whipping) cream3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract.1.
