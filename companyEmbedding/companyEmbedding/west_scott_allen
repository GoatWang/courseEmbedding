Bonds & Fines
Bonds and fines may be paid at the Fourth Avenue Jail Bond & Fine room located on the north west corner of the building. After Bond is paid, it may take up to 24 hours for an inmate’s release to be processed. Please note: If an inmate has an Immigration hold or any other law enforcement agency hold, paying the bond will not release the inmate. If you have questions, you may call Sheriff’s Information Management Services (SIMS), at 602-876-0322, prior to paying a bond. SIMS requires the person’s full name, date of birth, and if possible booking number. Once a bond payment is accepted, NO REFUNDS will be given. Any financial transactions over $10,000 will require you to provide your social security number in order to complete the transaction. This is a requirement of the Internal Revenue Service. If you do not wish to give your social security number, your transaction will not be completed. Acceptable means of payment are US Currency, a Cashier’s Check (official check), subject to verification, a U.S. Postal Money Order or a Western Union Money Order. These must be made out to the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office.

THE SHERIFFS OFFICE CAN ONLY ACCEPT THE EXACT AMOUNT OF THE BOND OR FINE.

Feb 12, 2016 Justin was one of my very best friends. He will always live in my heart. Justin and I spent hours and hours and hours talking about our faith and our walks in Christ. He was and will always be a HUGE part of my life. Justin had a tremendous loving heart. It was an immense honor, privilege, and blessing to be in each other's lives. Though bittersweet, I'm forever grateful that the wooden cross I gave him was with him on his rear view mirror at the time he went home to be with The Lord. My thoughts and prayers go to all of Justin's family and friends. You will always be remembered and loved, my sweetie (((((Justin)))))).  All my love,  Your sweetie Kelly  Sue Rubin-Harris on

Feb 10, 2016 Justin and Alicia were (are) dear friends of my ex husband and I. Alicia was there when my first son was born. They were there when we were married... I babysat their girls when they were just babies. I cannot fathom the grief that the family is feeling. I can only feel my own. I am praying not only for peace, but, for Hope... Hope for tomorrow that through all of this Justin's memory will be strong within all of our hearts... Because, he was such a blessing. He was a wonderful man who will always live on within each and every one of us... Be still my friend...  Jodi Mims on
