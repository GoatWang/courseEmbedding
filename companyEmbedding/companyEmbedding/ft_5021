                    Vero Shores is a wonderful, family friendly community, tucked away in the southern region of Vero Beach.  I frequent this small community quite often and it has become one of my most favorite neighborhoods in Vero Beach.  The neighborhood is very active.  Many neighbors participate in "block competitions" such as Christmas house decorating/lightings.  There are many homes in the neighborhood that are waterfront, sitting directly on the canal.  Most of them have docks with direct water access straight from the backyard.  I recently showed a waterfront home on this canal, as the sun was setting and the beauty was remarkable.  I highly recommend this delightful neighborhood!
