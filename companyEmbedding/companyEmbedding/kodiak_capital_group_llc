Lee Rodne, CEO, Allied Healthcare Group Limited  


 "Kodiak truly cares about the people and companies they fund.  They offer very desirable terms much better than other VC deals.  They acted in one week while other sources
would take months.  They aren't interested in taking control positions and have a great overall reputation and investor following. I can truly say it's the most pleasant investor relationship I
have ever had. Kodiak is the real deal!"

involved. We will always give Kodiak the opportunity to execute in any new transaction that we may consider."
 
Greg Lambrecht, CEO, SinglePoint, Inc.

inflection points in the evolution of our business and the 'go-public' process. They are fanatically founder friendly and just truly good people. I'd highly recommend Kodiak to any entrepreneur
without exception."

other funding source. They are truly interested in creating a win-win for everyone in the process. I’d highly recommend Kodiak as an investor."
 
Michael Holt, President, Penny Auction Solutions, Inc.  


 "We’ve enjoyed partnering with Kodiak. The fact that Kodiak is a well established venture firm structuring private equity investments for almost a decade made our decision to partner

Expo attendees are expected to include corporate officers from publicly traded companies, management of the largest providers of ancillary products, owners and operators for cultivation and dispensaries, qualified investment funds, private equity firms, family offices, leading angel investors, up and coming entrepreneurs, emerging brands, award winning infused product producers, and expert service providers from accounting to legal firms to compliance.
