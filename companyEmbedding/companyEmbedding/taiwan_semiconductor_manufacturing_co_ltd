Overview[edit]
Founded in Taiwan in 1987, TSMC was the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry and has long been the leading company in its field.[2][3] In addition to semiconductors, the company has also begun investing in lighting and solar energy-related industries.[2] It is listed on both the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. Morris Chang serves as Chairman, while F.C. Tseng serves as Vice Chairman. Mark Liu and C.C. Wei serve as Presidents and co-CEOs.[4]
Most of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), MediaTek, Marvell, STMicroelectronics and Broadcom are customers of TSMC, as well as emerging players such as Spreadtrum, AppliedMicro, Allwinner Technology and HiSilicon,[5] and many smaller companies. Leading programmable logic device companies Xilinx and Altera also make use of TSMC's foundry services.[6] Some Integrated Device Manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities like Intel and Texas Instruments outsource some of their production to TSMC.[7] At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP-portfolio.
The company has been increasing and upgrading its manufacturing capacity for most of its existence, although influenced by the demand cycles of the semiconductor industry. In 2011, the company planned to increase research and development expenditures by almost 39% to NT$50 billion in an effort to fend off growing competition.[8] The company also planned to expand capacity by 30% in 2011 to meet strong market demand.[9] In May 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved capital appropriations of US$568 million to establish, convert, and upgrade advanced technology capacity[10] after the company forecast higher than expected demand.[11] In August 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved additional capital appropriations of US$3.05 billion.[12]
In 2011, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of the A5 SoC and A6 SoCs for Apple's iPad and iPhone devices.[13][14] According to reports,[15] as of May 2014, Apple is sourcing its new A8 and A8X SoCs from TSMC[16][17] and later sourced the A9 SoC with both TSMC and Samsung(to increase volume for iPhone 6s launch) with the A9X being exclusively made by TSMC, thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different microarchitecture sizes. Apple has become TSMC's most important customer.[17][18]
TSMC's market capitalization reached a value of NT$1.9 trillion (US$63.4 billion) in December 2010.[19] It was ranked 70th in the FT Global 500 2013 list of the world's most highly valued companies with a capitalization of US$86.7 billion,[20] while reaching US$110 billion in May 2014.[21]In March 2017, TSMC's market capitalisation surpassed that of semiconductor giant Intel for the first time, hitting NT$5.14 trillion (US$168.4 billion), with Intel's at US$165.7 billion.[22]
Production Capabilities[edit]
On 12 inch wafers TSMC is realizing:

0.13 um (options: General Purpose (G), Low Power (LP), High Performance Low Voltage (LV)),
90 nm (based upon 80GC from Q4/2006),
65 nm (options: General Purpose (GP), Low Power (LP), Ultra-Low Power (ULP), LPG), and
55 nm (options: General Purpose (GP) and Low Power (LP)) devices

along with "Design for Manufacturing" (DFM) customer services.[23]
For the 40 nm process (still in production at end of 2016) TSMC reports:[24]

The 40nm logic family includes
* Low Power (LP),
* General Purpose Superb (G) and
* low-power triple gate oxide (LPG) process options.
All three processes offer multiple threshold voltage (Vt) core devices and 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V I/O options to meet different product requirements.

Although TSMC offers a variety of wafer product-lines (including high-voltage, mixed-signal, analog and MEMS[25]), it is best known for its logic chip product line with particular strength in advanced low-power processes such as 28 nm HPM with HKMG technology for mobile and high performance applications.[26][27] A press release from 2015[28] lists these seven variants:

Today TSMC has five versions of 28nm:
HP (high performance),
HPM (high performance mobile),
HPC (high performance computing),
HPL (high performance low power), and
LP (low power).
Two additional processes were added:
HPC+ which is an even faster version of HP and
ULP which is ultra-low power for IoT and other battery powered applications.

In press publications these processes will often be referenced, for example for the mobile variant, simply by 28nmHPM or even more briefly by 28HPM.
TMSC is at the end of 2016 further advertising 20 nm (HKMG, SiGe) and 16 nm (FinFet plus) based production technologies.[29]
Facilities[edit]




The NVIDIA GTX 1070, which uses a 16nm Pascal chip manufactured by TSMC.


Apart from its main base of operations in Hsinchu in Northern Taiwan, where several of its fab facilities are located, it also has leading-edge fabs in Southern Taiwan and Central Taiwan, with other fabs located at its subsidiaries TSMC China in Shanghai, China, WaferTech in Washington State, USA, and SSMC in Singapore,[30] and it has offices in China, Europe, India, Japan, North America, and South Korea.[31]
The following fabs are in operation as of 2016:[30]

Three 300 mm (12 inch) "GIGAFABs" in operation in Taiwan (Fabs 12, 14, 15)
Six 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabs in full operation in Taiwan (Fabs 3, 5, 6, 8,10,11)
TSMC China (Shanghai), 200 mm (8 inch) (Fab 10)
WaferTech, TSMC's wholly owned subsidiary, a 200 mm (8 inch) fab in Camas, Washington, United States (Fab 11)
SSMC (Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Co.), a joint venture with NXP Semiconductors in Singapore, 200 mm (8 inch), where production started at the end of 2002
One 150 mm (6 inch) wafer fab in full operation in Taiwan (Fab 2)

The investment of US$9.4 billion to build its third 12-inch (300 mm) wafer fabrication facility in Central Taiwan Science Park (Fab 15) was originally announced in 2010.[32] The facility was expected to output over 100,000 wafers a month and generate $5 billion per year of revenue.[33] TSMC has continued to expand advanced 28 nm manufacturing capacity at Fab 15.[34]
On January 12, 2011, TSMC announced the acquisition of land from Powerchip Semiconductor for NT$2.9 billion (US$96 million) to build two additional 300 mm fabs to cope with increasing global demand,[35] which would result in Fab 12B.
WaferTech subsidiary[edit]
WaferTech, a subsidiary of TSMC, is a pure-play semiconductor foundry located in Camas, Washington, USA. It is the largest pure-play foundry in the United States. The facility employs 1100 workers.[citation needed]
WaferTech was established in June 1996 as a joint venture with TSMC, Altera, Analog Devices, and ISSI as key partners. The four companies along with minor individual investors invested US$1.2 billion into this venture, which was at the time the single largest startup investment in the state of Washington. The company started production in July 1998 in its 200 mm (8 inch) semiconductor fabrication plant. Its first product was a 0.35 micrometer part for Altera.[citation needed]
TSMC bought out the joint venture partners in 2000 and acquired full control, and currently operates it as a fully owned subsidiary.[36]
WaferTech is based in Camas, 20 miles (30 km) outside of Portland, Oregon. The WaferTech campus contains a 1 million square foot (90,000 m²) complex housed on 260 acres (1 km²). The main fabrication facility consists of a 130,000 square feet (12,000 m²) 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabrication plant.[citation needed]

TSMC's sales have increased from NT$44 billion (US$1.5 billion) in 1997 to NT$763 billion (approximately US$25 billion) in 2014, while net income was NT$264 billion (US$9 billion) in 2014 with a gross profit margin of 50%.[39]
TSMC and the rest of the foundry industry are exposed to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. During upturns, TSMC must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand. However, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand, and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities.[40] As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.
In 2014, TSMC was at the forefront of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications,[26][27] leading major smartphone chip companies such as Qualcomm,[41][42] Mediatek[42][43] and Apple[16][18] to place an increasing amount of orders.[26] While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation) have encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28 nm capacity,[43] the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.[27]
For most of 2014, TSMC saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ first-quarter results.[11][44] For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nanometer technology business growing more than 30% from the previous quarter.[45] Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules,[46] and in August 2014 it was reported that TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.[47]
However, monthly sales for 2014 peaked in October, decreasing by 10% in November due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers.[48] TSMC's revenue for 2014 saw growth of 28% over the previous year, while TSMC has forecast that revenue for 2015 will grow by 15 to 20 percent from 2014, thanks to strong demand for its 20 nm process, new 16 nm FinFET process technology as well as continuing demand for 28 nm, and demand for less advanced chip fabrication in its 8-inch fabs.[48]
In October 2014, ARM and TSMC announced a new multi-year agreement for the development of ARM based 10 nm FinFET processors.[49]

Overview[edit]
Founded in Taiwan in 1987, TSMC was the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry and has long been the leading company in its field.[2][3] In addition to semiconductors, the company has also begun investing in lighting and solar energy-related industries.[2] It is listed on both the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. Morris Chang serves as Chairman, while F.C. Tseng serves as Vice Chairman. Mark Liu and C.C. Wei serve as Presidents and co-CEOs.[4]
Most of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), MediaTek, Marvell, STMicroelectronics and Broadcom are customers of TSMC, as well as emerging players such as Spreadtrum, AppliedMicro, Allwinner Technology and HiSilicon,[5] and many smaller companies. Leading programmable logic device companies Xilinx and Altera also make use of TSMC's foundry services.[6] Some Integrated Device Manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities like Intel and Texas Instruments outsource some of their production to TSMC.[7] At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP-portfolio.
The company has been increasing and upgrading its manufacturing capacity for most of its existence, although influenced by the demand cycles of the semiconductor industry. In 2011, the company planned to increase research and development expenditures by almost 39% to NT$50 billion in an effort to fend off growing competition.[8] The company also planned to expand capacity by 30% in 2011 to meet strong market demand.[9] In May 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved capital appropriations of US$568 million to establish, convert, and upgrade advanced technology capacity[10] after the company forecast higher than expected demand.[11] In August 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved additional capital appropriations of US$3.05 billion.[12]
In 2011, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of the A5 SoC and A6 SoCs for Apple's iPad and iPhone devices.[13][14] According to reports,[15] as of May 2014, Apple is sourcing its new A8 and A8X SoCs from TSMC[16][17] and later sourced the A9 SoC with both TSMC and Samsung(to increase volume for iPhone 6s launch) with the A9X being exclusively made by TSMC, thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different microarchitecture sizes. Apple has become TSMC's most important customer.[17][18]
TSMC's market capitalization reached a value of NT$1.9 trillion (US$63.4 billion) in December 2010.[19] It was ranked 70th in the FT Global 500 2013 list of the world's most highly valued companies with a capitalization of US$86.7 billion,[20] while reaching US$110 billion in May 2014.[21]In March 2017, TSMC's market capitalisation surpassed that of semiconductor giant Intel for the first time, hitting NT$5.14 trillion (US$168.4 billion), with Intel's at US$165.7 billion.[22]
Production Capabilities[edit]
On 12 inch wafers TSMC is realizing:

0.13 um (options: General Purpose (G), Low Power (LP), High Performance Low Voltage (LV)),
90 nm (based upon 80GC from Q4/2006),
65 nm (options: General Purpose (GP), Low Power (LP), Ultra-Low Power (ULP), LPG), and
55 nm (options: General Purpose (GP) and Low Power (LP)) devices

along with "Design for Manufacturing" (DFM) customer services.[23]
For the 40 nm process (still in production at end of 2016) TSMC reports:[24]

The 40nm logic family includes
* Low Power (LP),
* General Purpose Superb (G) and
* low-power triple gate oxide (LPG) process options.
All three processes offer multiple threshold voltage (Vt) core devices and 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V I/O options to meet different product requirements.

Although TSMC offers a variety of wafer product-lines (including high-voltage, mixed-signal, analog and MEMS[25]), it is best known for its logic chip product line with particular strength in advanced low-power processes such as 28 nm HPM with HKMG technology for mobile and high performance applications.[26][27] A press release from 2015[28] lists these seven variants:

Today TSMC has five versions of 28nm:
HP (high performance),
HPM (high performance mobile),
HPC (high performance computing),
HPL (high performance low power), and
LP (low power).
Two additional processes were added:
HPC+ which is an even faster version of HP and
ULP which is ultra-low power for IoT and other battery powered applications.

In press publications these processes will often be referenced, for example for the mobile variant, simply by 28nmHPM or even more briefly by 28HPM.
TMSC is at the end of 2016 further advertising 20 nm (HKMG, SiGe) and 16 nm (FinFet plus) based production technologies.[29]
Facilities[edit]




The NVIDIA GTX 1070, which uses a 16nm Pascal chip manufactured by TSMC.


Apart from its main base of operations in Hsinchu in Northern Taiwan, where several of its fab facilities are located, it also has leading-edge fabs in Southern Taiwan and Central Taiwan, with other fabs located at its subsidiaries TSMC China in Shanghai, China, WaferTech in Washington State, USA, and SSMC in Singapore,[30] and it has offices in China, Europe, India, Japan, North America, and South Korea.[31]
The following fabs are in operation as of 2016:[30]

Three 300 mm (12 inch) "GIGAFABs" in operation in Taiwan (Fabs 12, 14, 15)
Six 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabs in full operation in Taiwan (Fabs 3, 5, 6, 8,10,11)
TSMC China (Shanghai), 200 mm (8 inch) (Fab 10)
WaferTech, TSMC's wholly owned subsidiary, a 200 mm (8 inch) fab in Camas, Washington, United States (Fab 11)
SSMC (Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Co.), a joint venture with NXP Semiconductors in Singapore, 200 mm (8 inch), where production started at the end of 2002
One 150 mm (6 inch) wafer fab in full operation in Taiwan (Fab 2)

The investment of US$9.4 billion to build its third 12-inch (300 mm) wafer fabrication facility in Central Taiwan Science Park (Fab 15) was originally announced in 2010.[32] The facility was expected to output over 100,000 wafers a month and generate $5 billion per year of revenue.[33] TSMC has continued to expand advanced 28 nm manufacturing capacity at Fab 15.[34]
On January 12, 2011, TSMC announced the acquisition of land from Powerchip Semiconductor for NT$2.9 billion (US$96 million) to build two additional 300 mm fabs to cope with increasing global demand,[35] which would result in Fab 12B.
WaferTech subsidiary[edit]
WaferTech, a subsidiary of TSMC, is a pure-play semiconductor foundry located in Camas, Washington, USA. It is the largest pure-play foundry in the United States. The facility employs 1100 workers.[citation needed]
WaferTech was established in June 1996 as a joint venture with TSMC, Altera, Analog Devices, and ISSI as key partners. The four companies along with minor individual investors invested US$1.2 billion into this venture, which was at the time the single largest startup investment in the state of Washington. The company started production in July 1998 in its 200 mm (8 inch) semiconductor fabrication plant. Its first product was a 0.35 micrometer part for Altera.[citation needed]
TSMC bought out the joint venture partners in 2000 and acquired full control, and currently operates it as a fully owned subsidiary.[36]
WaferTech is based in Camas, 20 miles (30 km) outside of Portland, Oregon. The WaferTech campus contains a 1 million square foot (90,000 m²) complex housed on 260 acres (1 km²). The main fabrication facility consists of a 130,000 square feet (12,000 m²) 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabrication plant.[citation needed]

TSMC's sales have increased from NT$44 billion (US$1.5 billion) in 1997 to NT$763 billion (approximately US$25 billion) in 2014, while net income was NT$264 billion (US$9 billion) in 2014 with a gross profit margin of 50%.[39]
TSMC and the rest of the foundry industry are exposed to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. During upturns, TSMC must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand. However, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand, and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities.[40] As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.
In 2014, TSMC was at the forefront of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications,[26][27] leading major smartphone chip companies such as Qualcomm,[41][42] Mediatek[42][43] and Apple[16][18] to place an increasing amount of orders.[26] While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation) have encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28 nm capacity,[43] the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.[27]
For most of 2014, TSMC saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ first-quarter results.[11][44] For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nanometer technology business growing more than 30% from the previous quarter.[45] Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules,[46] and in August 2014 it was reported that TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.[47]
However, monthly sales for 2014 peaked in October, decreasing by 10% in November due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers.[48] TSMC's revenue for 2014 saw growth of 28% over the previous year, while TSMC has forecast that revenue for 2015 will grow by 15 to 20 percent from 2014, thanks to strong demand for its 20 nm process, new 16 nm FinFET process technology as well as continuing demand for 28 nm, and demand for less advanced chip fabrication in its 8-inch fabs.[48]
In October 2014, ARM and TSMC announced a new multi-year agreement for the development of ARM based 10 nm FinFET processors.[49]

Overview[edit]
Founded in Taiwan in 1987, TSMC was the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry and has long been the leading company in its field.[2][3] In addition to semiconductors, the company has also begun investing in lighting and solar energy-related industries.[2] It is listed on both the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. Morris Chang serves as Chairman, while F.C. Tseng serves as Vice Chairman. Mark Liu and C.C. Wei serve as Presidents and co-CEOs.[4]
Most of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), MediaTek, Marvell, STMicroelectronics and Broadcom are customers of TSMC, as well as emerging players such as Spreadtrum, AppliedMicro, Allwinner Technology and HiSilicon,[5] and many smaller companies. Leading programmable logic device companies Xilinx and Altera also make use of TSMC's foundry services.[6] Some Integrated Device Manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities like Intel and Texas Instruments outsource some of their production to TSMC.[7] At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP-portfolio.
The company has been increasing and upgrading its manufacturing capacity for most of its existence, although influenced by the demand cycles of the semiconductor industry. In 2011, the company planned to increase research and development expenditures by almost 39% to NT$50 billion in an effort to fend off growing competition.[8] The company also planned to expand capacity by 30% in 2011 to meet strong market demand.[9] In May 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved capital appropriations of US$568 million to establish, convert, and upgrade advanced technology capacity[10] after the company forecast higher than expected demand.[11] In August 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved additional capital appropriations of US$3.05 billion.[12]
In 2011, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of the A5 SoC and A6 SoCs for Apple's iPad and iPhone devices.[13][14] According to reports,[15] as of May 2014, Apple is sourcing its new A8 and A8X SoCs from TSMC[16][17] and later sourced the A9 SoC with both TSMC and Samsung(to increase volume for iPhone 6s launch) with the A9X being exclusively made by TSMC, thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different microarchitecture sizes. Apple has become TSMC's most important customer.[17][18]
TSMC's market capitalization reached a value of NT$1.9 trillion (US$63.4 billion) in December 2010.[19] It was ranked 70th in the FT Global 500 2013 list of the world's most highly valued companies with a capitalization of US$86.7 billion,[20] while reaching US$110 billion in May 2014.[21]In March 2017, TSMC's market capitalisation surpassed that of semiconductor giant Intel for the first time, hitting NT$5.14 trillion (US$168.4 billion), with Intel's at US$165.7 billion.[22]
Production Capabilities[edit]
On 12 inch wafers TSMC is realizing:

0.13 um (options: General Purpose (G), Low Power (LP), High Performance Low Voltage (LV)),
90 nm (based upon 80GC from Q4/2006),
65 nm (options: General Purpose (GP), Low Power (LP), Ultra-Low Power (ULP), LPG), and
55 nm (options: General Purpose (GP) and Low Power (LP)) devices

along with "Design for Manufacturing" (DFM) customer services.[23]
For the 40 nm process (still in production at end of 2016) TSMC reports:[24]

The 40nm logic family includes
* Low Power (LP),
* General Purpose Superb (G) and
* low-power triple gate oxide (LPG) process options.
All three processes offer multiple threshold voltage (Vt) core devices and 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V I/O options to meet different product requirements.

Although TSMC offers a variety of wafer product-lines (including high-voltage, mixed-signal, analog and MEMS[25]), it is best known for its logic chip product line with particular strength in advanced low-power processes such as 28 nm HPM with HKMG technology for mobile and high performance applications.[26][27] A press release from 2015[28] lists these seven variants:

Today TSMC has five versions of 28nm:
HP (high performance),
HPM (high performance mobile),
HPC (high performance computing),
HPL (high performance low power), and
LP (low power).
Two additional processes were added:
HPC+ which is an even faster version of HP and
ULP which is ultra-low power for IoT and other battery powered applications.

In press publications these processes will often be referenced, for example for the mobile variant, simply by 28nmHPM or even more briefly by 28HPM.
TMSC is at the end of 2016 further advertising 20 nm (HKMG, SiGe) and 16 nm (FinFet plus) based production technologies.[29]
Facilities[edit]

The investment of US$9.4 billion to build its third 12-inch (300 mm) wafer fabrication facility in Central Taiwan Science Park (Fab 15) was originally announced in 2010.[32] The facility was expected to output over 100,000 wafers a month and generate $5 billion per year of revenue.[33] TSMC has continued to expand advanced 28 nm manufacturing capacity at Fab 15.[34]
On January 12, 2011, TSMC announced the acquisition of land from Powerchip Semiconductor for NT$2.9 billion (US$96 million) to build two additional 300 mm fabs to cope with increasing global demand,[35] which would result in Fab 12B.
WaferTech subsidiary[edit]
WaferTech, a subsidiary of TSMC, is a pure-play semiconductor foundry located in Camas, Washington, USA. It is the largest pure-play foundry in the United States. The facility employs 1100 workers.[citation needed]
WaferTech was established in June 1996 as a joint venture with TSMC, Altera, Analog Devices, and ISSI as key partners. The four companies along with minor individual investors invested US$1.2 billion into this venture, which was at the time the single largest startup investment in the state of Washington. The company started production in July 1998 in its 200 mm (8 inch) semiconductor fabrication plant. Its first product was a 0.35 micrometer part for Altera.[citation needed]
TSMC bought out the joint venture partners in 2000 and acquired full control, and currently operates it as a fully owned subsidiary.[36]
WaferTech is based in Camas, 20 miles (30 km) outside of Portland, Oregon. The WaferTech campus contains a 1 million square foot (90,000 m²) complex housed on 260 acres (1 km²). The main fabrication facility consists of a 130,000 square feet (12,000 m²) 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabrication plant.[citation needed]

TSMC's sales have increased from NT$44 billion (US$1.5 billion) in 1997 to NT$763 billion (approximately US$25 billion) in 2014, while net income was NT$264 billion (US$9 billion) in 2014 with a gross profit margin of 50%.[39]
TSMC and the rest of the foundry industry are exposed to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. During upturns, TSMC must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand. However, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand, and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities.[40] As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.
In 2014, TSMC was at the forefront of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications,[26][27] leading major smartphone chip companies such as Qualcomm,[41][42] Mediatek[42][43] and Apple[16][18] to place an increasing amount of orders.[26] While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation) have encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28 nm capacity,[43] the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.[27]
For most of 2014, TSMC saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ first-quarter results.[11][44] For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nanometer technology business growing more than 30% from the previous quarter.[45] Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules,[46] and in August 2014 it was reported that TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.[47]
However, monthly sales for 2014 peaked in October, decreasing by 10% in November due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers.[48] TSMC's revenue for 2014 saw growth of 28% over the previous year, while TSMC has forecast that revenue for 2015 will grow by 15 to 20 percent from 2014, thanks to strong demand for its 20 nm process, new 16 nm FinFET process technology as well as continuing demand for 28 nm, and demand for less advanced chip fabrication in its 8-inch fabs.[48]
In October 2014, ARM and TSMC announced a new multi-year agreement for the development of ARM based 10 nm FinFET processors.[49]

Overview[edit]
Founded in Taiwan in 1987, TSMC was the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry and has long been the leading company in its field.[2][3] In addition to semiconductors, the company has also begun investing in lighting and solar energy-related industries.[2] It is listed on both the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. Morris Chang serves as Chairman, while F.C. Tseng serves as Vice Chairman. Mark Liu and C.C. Wei serve as Presidents and co-CEOs.[4]
Most of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), MediaTek, Marvell, STMicroelectronics and Broadcom are customers of TSMC, as well as emerging players such as Spreadtrum, AppliedMicro, Allwinner Technology and HiSilicon,[5] and many smaller companies. Leading programmable logic device companies Xilinx and Altera also make use of TSMC's foundry services.[6] Some Integrated Device Manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities like Intel and Texas Instruments outsource some of their production to TSMC.[7] At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP-portfolio.
The company has been increasing and upgrading its manufacturing capacity for most of its existence, although influenced by the demand cycles of the semiconductor industry. In 2011, the company planned to increase research and development expenditures by almost 39% to NT$50 billion in an effort to fend off growing competition.[8] The company also planned to expand capacity by 30% in 2011 to meet strong market demand.[9] In May 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved capital appropriations of US$568 million to establish, convert, and upgrade advanced technology capacity[10] after the company forecast higher than expected demand.[11] In August 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved additional capital appropriations of US$3.05 billion.[12]
In 2011, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of the A5 SoC and A6 SoCs for Apple's iPad and iPhone devices.[13][14] According to reports,[15] as of May 2014, Apple is sourcing its new A8 and A8X SoCs from TSMC[16][17] and later sourced the A9 SoC with both TSMC and Samsung(to increase volume for iPhone 6s launch) with the A9X being exclusively made by TSMC, thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different microarchitecture sizes. Apple has become TSMC's most important customer.[17][18]
TSMC's market capitalization reached a value of NT$1.9 trillion (US$63.4 billion) in December 2010.[19] It was ranked 70th in the FT Global 500 2013 list of the world's most highly valued companies with a capitalization of US$86.7 billion,[20] while reaching US$110 billion in May 2014.[21]In March 2017, TSMC's market capitalisation surpassed that of semiconductor giant Intel for the first time, hitting NT$5.14 trillion (US$168.4 billion), with Intel's at US$165.7 billion.[22]
Production Capabilities[edit]
On 12 inch wafers TSMC is realizing:

0.13 um (options: General Purpose (G), Low Power (LP), High Performance Low Voltage (LV)),
90 nm (based upon 80GC from Q4/2006),
65 nm (options: General Purpose (GP), Low Power (LP), Ultra-Low Power (ULP), LPG), and
55 nm (options: General Purpose (GP) and Low Power (LP)) devices

along with "Design for Manufacturing" (DFM) customer services.[23]
For the 40 nm process (still in production at end of 2016) TSMC reports:[24]

The 40nm logic family includes
* Low Power (LP),
* General Purpose Superb (G) and
* low-power triple gate oxide (LPG) process options.
All three processes offer multiple threshold voltage (Vt) core devices and 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V I/O options to meet different product requirements.

Although TSMC offers a variety of wafer product-lines (including high-voltage, mixed-signal, analog and MEMS[25]), it is best known for its logic chip product line with particular strength in advanced low-power processes such as 28 nm HPM with HKMG technology for mobile and high performance applications.[26][27] A press release from 2015[28] lists these seven variants:

Today TSMC has five versions of 28nm:
HP (high performance),
HPM (high performance mobile),
HPC (high performance computing),
HPL (high performance low power), and
LP (low power).
Two additional processes were added:
HPC+ which is an even faster version of HP and
ULP which is ultra-low power for IoT and other battery powered applications.

In press publications these processes will often be referenced, for example for the mobile variant, simply by 28nmHPM or even more briefly by 28HPM.
TMSC is at the end of 2016 further advertising 20 nm (HKMG, SiGe) and 16 nm (FinFet plus) based production technologies.[29]
Facilities[edit]




The NVIDIA GTX 1070, which uses a 16nm Pascal chip manufactured by TSMC.


Apart from its main base of operations in Hsinchu in Northern Taiwan, where several of its fab facilities are located, it also has leading-edge fabs in Southern Taiwan and Central Taiwan, with other fabs located at its subsidiaries TSMC China in Shanghai, China, WaferTech in Washington State, USA, and SSMC in Singapore,[30] and it has offices in China, Europe, India, Japan, North America, and South Korea.[31]
The following fabs are in operation as of 2016:[30]

Three 300 mm (12 inch) "GIGAFABs" in operation in Taiwan (Fabs 12, 14, 15)
Six 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabs in full operation in Taiwan (Fabs 3, 5, 6, 8,10,11)
TSMC China (Shanghai), 200 mm (8 inch) (Fab 10)
WaferTech, TSMC's wholly owned subsidiary, a 200 mm (8 inch) fab in Camas, Washington, United States (Fab 11)
SSMC (Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Co.), a joint venture with NXP Semiconductors in Singapore, 200 mm (8 inch), where production started at the end of 2002
One 150 mm (6 inch) wafer fab in full operation in Taiwan (Fab 2)

The investment of US$9.4 billion to build its third 12-inch (300 mm) wafer fabrication facility in Central Taiwan Science Park (Fab 15) was originally announced in 2010.[32] The facility was expected to output over 100,000 wafers a month and generate $5 billion per year of revenue.[33] TSMC has continued to expand advanced 28 nm manufacturing capacity at Fab 15.[34]
On January 12, 2011, TSMC announced the acquisition of land from Powerchip Semiconductor for NT$2.9 billion (US$96 million) to build two additional 300 mm fabs to cope with increasing global demand,[35] which would result in Fab 12B.
WaferTech subsidiary[edit]
WaferTech, a subsidiary of TSMC, is a pure-play semiconductor foundry located in Camas, Washington, USA. It is the largest pure-play foundry in the United States. The facility employs 1100 workers.[citation needed]
WaferTech was established in June 1996 as a joint venture with TSMC, Altera, Analog Devices, and ISSI as key partners. The four companies along with minor individual investors invested US$1.2 billion into this venture, which was at the time the single largest startup investment in the state of Washington. The company started production in July 1998 in its 200 mm (8 inch) semiconductor fabrication plant. Its first product was a 0.35 micrometer part for Altera.[citation needed]
TSMC bought out the joint venture partners in 2000 and acquired full control, and currently operates it as a fully owned subsidiary.[36]
WaferTech is based in Camas, 20 miles (30 km) outside of Portland, Oregon. The WaferTech campus contains a 1 million square foot (90,000 m²) complex housed on 260 acres (1 km²). The main fabrication facility consists of a 130,000 square feet (12,000 m²) 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabrication plant.[citation needed]

TSMC's sales have increased from NT$44 billion (US$1.5 billion) in 1997 to NT$763 billion (approximately US$25 billion) in 2014, while net income was NT$264 billion (US$9 billion) in 2014 with a gross profit margin of 50%.[39]
TSMC and the rest of the foundry industry are exposed to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. During upturns, TSMC must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand. However, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand, and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities.[40] As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.
In 2014, TSMC was at the forefront of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications,[26][27] leading major smartphone chip companies such as Qualcomm,[41][42] Mediatek[42][43] and Apple[16][18] to place an increasing amount of orders.[26] While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation) have encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28 nm capacity,[43] the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.[27]
For most of 2014, TSMC saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ first-quarter results.[11][44] For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nanometer technology business growing more than 30% from the previous quarter.[45] Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules,[46] and in August 2014 it was reported that TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.[47]
However, monthly sales for 2014 peaked in October, decreasing by 10% in November due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers.[48] TSMC's revenue for 2014 saw growth of 28% over the previous year, while TSMC has forecast that revenue for 2015 will grow by 15 to 20 percent from 2014, thanks to strong demand for its 20 nm process, new 16 nm FinFET process technology as well as continuing demand for 28 nm, and demand for less advanced chip fabrication in its 8-inch fabs.[48]
In October 2014, ARM and TSMC announced a new multi-year agreement for the development of ARM based 10 nm FinFET processors.[49]

Overview[edit]
Founded in Taiwan in 1987, TSMC was the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry and has long been the leading company in its field.[2][3] In addition to semiconductors, the company has also begun investing in lighting and solar energy-related industries.[2] It is listed on both the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. Morris Chang serves as Chairman, while F.C. Tseng serves as Vice Chairman. Mark Liu and C.C. Wei serve as Presidents and co-CEOs.[4]
Most of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), MediaTek, Marvell, STMicroelectronics and Broadcom are customers of TSMC, as well as emerging players such as Spreadtrum, AppliedMicro, Allwinner Technology and HiSilicon,[5] and many smaller companies. Leading programmable logic device companies Xilinx and Altera also make use of TSMC's foundry services.[6] Some Integrated Device Manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities like Intel and Texas Instruments outsource some of their production to TSMC.[7] At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP-portfolio.
The company has been increasing and upgrading its manufacturing capacity for most of its existence, although influenced by the demand cycles of the semiconductor industry. In 2011, the company planned to increase research and development expenditures by almost 39% to NT$50 billion in an effort to fend off growing competition.[8] The company also planned to expand capacity by 30% in 2011 to meet strong market demand.[9] In May 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved capital appropriations of US$568 million to establish, convert, and upgrade advanced technology capacity[10] after the company forecast higher than expected demand.[11] In August 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved additional capital appropriations of US$3.05 billion.[12]
In 2011, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of the A5 SoC and A6 SoCs for Apple's iPad and iPhone devices.[13][14] According to reports,[15] as of May 2014, Apple is sourcing its new A8 and A8X SoCs from TSMC[16][17] and later sourced the A9 SoC with both TSMC and Samsung(to increase volume for iPhone 6s launch) with the A9X being exclusively made by TSMC, thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different microarchitecture sizes. Apple has become TSMC's most important customer.[17][18]
TSMC's market capitalization reached a value of NT$1.9 trillion (US$63.4 billion) in December 2010.[19] It was ranked 70th in the FT Global 500 2013 list of the world's most highly valued companies with a capitalization of US$86.7 billion,[20] while reaching US$110 billion in May 2014.[21]In March 2017, TSMC's market capitalisation surpassed that of semiconductor giant Intel for the first time, hitting NT$5.14 trillion (US$168.4 billion), with Intel's at US$165.7 billion.[22]
Production Capabilities[edit]
On 12 inch wafers TSMC is realizing:

0.13 um (options: General Purpose (G), Low Power (LP), High Performance Low Voltage (LV)),
90 nm (based upon 80GC from Q4/2006),
65 nm (options: General Purpose (GP), Low Power (LP), Ultra-Low Power (ULP), LPG), and
55 nm (options: General Purpose (GP) and Low Power (LP)) devices

along with "Design for Manufacturing" (DFM) customer services.[23]
For the 40 nm process (still in production at end of 2016) TSMC reports:[24]

The 40nm logic family includes
* Low Power (LP),
* General Purpose Superb (G) and
* low-power triple gate oxide (LPG) process options.
All three processes offer multiple threshold voltage (Vt) core devices and 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V I/O options to meet different product requirements.

Although TSMC offers a variety of wafer product-lines (including high-voltage, mixed-signal, analog and MEMS[25]), it is best known for its logic chip product line with particular strength in advanced low-power processes such as 28 nm HPM with HKMG technology for mobile and high performance applications.[26][27] A press release from 2015[28] lists these seven variants:

Today TSMC has five versions of 28nm:
HP (high performance),
HPM (high performance mobile),
HPC (high performance computing),
HPL (high performance low power), and
LP (low power).
Two additional processes were added:
HPC+ which is an even faster version of HP and
ULP which is ultra-low power for IoT and other battery powered applications.

In press publications these processes will often be referenced, for example for the mobile variant, simply by 28nmHPM or even more briefly by 28HPM.
TMSC is at the end of 2016 further advertising 20 nm (HKMG, SiGe) and 16 nm (FinFet plus) based production technologies.[29]
Facilities[edit]




The NVIDIA GTX 1070, which uses a 16nm Pascal chip manufactured by TSMC.


Apart from its main base of operations in Hsinchu in Northern Taiwan, where several of its fab facilities are located, it also has leading-edge fabs in Southern Taiwan and Central Taiwan, with other fabs located at its subsidiaries TSMC China in Shanghai, China, WaferTech in Washington State, USA, and SSMC in Singapore,[30] and it has offices in China, Europe, India, Japan, North America, and South Korea.[31]
The following fabs are in operation as of 2016:[30]

Three 300 mm (12 inch) "GIGAFABs" in operation in Taiwan (Fabs 12, 14, 15)
Six 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabs in full operation in Taiwan (Fabs 3, 5, 6, 8,10,11)
TSMC China (Shanghai), 200 mm (8 inch) (Fab 10)
WaferTech, TSMC's wholly owned subsidiary, a 200 mm (8 inch) fab in Camas, Washington, United States (Fab 11)
SSMC (Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Co.), a joint venture with NXP Semiconductors in Singapore, 200 mm (8 inch), where production started at the end of 2002
One 150 mm (6 inch) wafer fab in full operation in Taiwan (Fab 2)

The investment of US$9.4 billion to build its third 12-inch (300 mm) wafer fabrication facility in Central Taiwan Science Park (Fab 15) was originally announced in 2010.[32] The facility was expected to output over 100,000 wafers a month and generate $5 billion per year of revenue.[33] TSMC has continued to expand advanced 28 nm manufacturing capacity at Fab 15.[34]
On January 12, 2011, TSMC announced the acquisition of land from Powerchip Semiconductor for NT$2.9 billion (US$96 million) to build two additional 300 mm fabs to cope with increasing global demand,[35] which would result in Fab 12B.
WaferTech subsidiary[edit]
WaferTech, a subsidiary of TSMC, is a pure-play semiconductor foundry located in Camas, Washington, USA. It is the largest pure-play foundry in the United States. The facility employs 1100 workers.[citation needed]
WaferTech was established in June 1996 as a joint venture with TSMC, Altera, Analog Devices, and ISSI as key partners. The four companies along with minor individual investors invested US$1.2 billion into this venture, which was at the time the single largest startup investment in the state of Washington. The company started production in July 1998 in its 200 mm (8 inch) semiconductor fabrication plant. Its first product was a 0.35 micrometer part for Altera.[citation needed]
TSMC bought out the joint venture partners in 2000 and acquired full control, and currently operates it as a fully owned subsidiary.[36]
WaferTech is based in Camas, 20 miles (30 km) outside of Portland, Oregon. The WaferTech campus contains a 1 million square foot (90,000 m²) complex housed on 260 acres (1 km²). The main fabrication facility consists of a 130,000 square feet (12,000 m²) 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabrication plant.[citation needed]

TSMC's sales have increased from NT$44 billion (US$1.5 billion) in 1997 to NT$763 billion (approximately US$25 billion) in 2014, while net income was NT$264 billion (US$9 billion) in 2014 with a gross profit margin of 50%.[39]
TSMC and the rest of the foundry industry are exposed to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. During upturns, TSMC must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand. However, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand, and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities.[40] As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.
In 2014, TSMC was at the forefront of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications,[26][27] leading major smartphone chip companies such as Qualcomm,[41][42] Mediatek[42][43] and Apple[16][18] to place an increasing amount of orders.[26] While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation) have encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28 nm capacity,[43] the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.[27]
For most of 2014, TSMC saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ first-quarter results.[11][44] For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nanometer technology business growing more than 30% from the previous quarter.[45] Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules,[46] and in August 2014 it was reported that TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.[47]
However, monthly sales for 2014 peaked in October, decreasing by 10% in November due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers.[48] TSMC's revenue for 2014 saw growth of 28% over the previous year, while TSMC has forecast that revenue for 2015 will grow by 15 to 20 percent from 2014, thanks to strong demand for its 20 nm process, new 16 nm FinFET process technology as well as continuing demand for 28 nm, and demand for less advanced chip fabrication in its 8-inch fabs.[48]
In October 2014, ARM and TSMC announced a new multi-year agreement for the development of ARM based 10 nm FinFET processors.[49]

Report: Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. and Samsung Facing 10-Nano Yield Issues
A report from DigiTimes says that both Samsung and TSMC are facing lower-than-expected manufacturing yield rates on its latest technology, impacting product launch schedules. 











                Ashraf Eassa
            

                (TMFChipFool)



            
            Mar 3, 2017 at 2:30PM
            
            





Contract chip manufacturers Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) both recently began mass production of chips using their respective 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technologies.
Both companies' 10-nanometer technologies allow chipmakers to build more densely packed (meaning more features) and higher-performing products, two things that are generally good in the world of chips.

Image source: Intel.

However, according to a recent report from DigiTimes, both TSMC and Samsung are facing manufacturing yield issues with their respective 10-nanometer technologies. Let's go over the implications of those yield challenges.
Why are low manufacturing yields bad?
Manufacturing yield refers to the percentage of manufactured chips that both work and meet the performance and power specifications mandated by the design. It generally costs a fixed amount of money to manufacture a wafer of chips, so the higher the yield rate, the greater the number of chips are produced for a given cost, which means lower effective per-chip cost.
Conversely, low yield rates mean higher costs. Such costs can either be passed on to the customer, the chip manufacturing company itself could eat the costs, or the responsibility could be shared.
Additionally, chipmakers put in a certain amount of manufacturing capacity in anticipation of customer demand. If manufacturing yield rates are too far below plan, then a customer using the low-yielding technology may not be able to get ahold of sufficient supply of products.
So, low manufacturing yields are generally bad for business.
Specific impacts on TSMC's and Samsung's customers
The lead customer for TSMC's 10-nanometer technology appears to be MediaTek, which is using this technology to manufacture its Helio X30 line of premium smartphone chips. In a statement to Nikkei Asian Review, a MediaTek executive said that the X30 was "delayed because the yield rate of 10 [nanometer] process technology [from TSMC] has not yet reached a satisfactory level... and we are a bit stuck on that."
A silver lining here is that MediaTek doesn't expect significant adoption of the X30 in premium smartphones (saying that it expects the X30 to be used in "less than 10 smartphone models"), so these yield challenges are unlikely to significantly disrupt MediaTek's business or the businesses of its customers.
For Samsung and its lead customer, mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the struggle is more significant. The Samsung Galaxy S8-series devices that are set to be formally announced later this month are expected to Samsung's Exynos 8895 for some variants and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 in other variants. Both chips are believed to be manufactured by Samsung using its 10-nanometer LPE technology. DigiTimes says that Samsung delayed the rollout of the Galaxy S8-series devices due "unsatisfactory yield rates."





How about the iPhone?
 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to tap TSMC to manufacture the former's upcoming A11 applications processor on the latter's 10-nanometer technology. The bad news is that the yield challenges described by DigiTimes could impact Apple's ability to meet demand for its next-generation iPhones.
The good news is that Apple's next iPhone models aren't expected to launch until the fall, which gives both Apple and TSMC additional time to work out the kinks on the 10-nanometer technology.
Furthermore, some of the yield issues that MediaTek may be seeing could be related to its underlying chip design rather than only due to TSMC's technology. In that case, there's a reasonable chance that Apple won't face quite the yield problems that MediaTek is apparently coping with.

Capital Research & Management Co. (Global Investors)

                                    Capital World Global Investors (CWGI) is the investment adviser to the American Funds Group, a family of 30 funds marketed to individuals exclusively through financial advisers and other intermediaries. American Funds are also used as investment vehicles for 401ks, other retirement plans, variable annuities and 529 college savings plans. The funds have the following characteristics: (1) a long-term, value-oriented approach (2) long-established, global research (3) a multiple portfolio counselor system that combines teamwork with individual accountability (4) experienced, long-tenured investment professionals and (5) a commitment to low operating expenses, among the lowest in the fund industry.^CWGI uses a Multiple Portfolio Counselor System. The assets of each fund are divided into smaller, more manageable portions. Each portion is managed by a portfolio counselor who operates autonomously, investing his or her portion as though it were an entire fund (subject to fund objectives and overall guidelines). Research analysts typically manage a segment as well (usually about 20% of the fund's assets), bringing their expertise directly to bear on the fund's results. Portfolio counselors are free to make their own decisions. As a fund's assets grow, new counselors can be added.^Investment decisions are based on internal research. Equity research is comprehensive and bottom-up while at the same time constantly monitoring broader economic, political, currency and interest rate trends. Investment research is proprietary and used solely by CWGI portfolio managers.

Intel Corp.


                                                                                     •  Wilmington, DE                                                                            

                                        Intel Corporation is an American multinational semiconductor chip maker corporation headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Intel is the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip maker, based on revenue. It is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers. Intel Corporation, founded on July 18, 1968, is a portmanteau of Integrated Electronics (the fact that "intel" is the term for intelligence information was also quite suitable). Intel also makes motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphic chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing. Founded by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove, Intel combines advanced chip design capability with a leading-edge manufacturing capability. Though Intel was originally known primarily to engineers and technologists, its "Intel Inside" advertising campaign of the 1990s made it and its Pentium processor household names.

KLA-Tencor Corp.

                                     •  Computer Software                                                                             •  Milpitas, California                                                                    

                                    KLA-Tencor was formed in April 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments (KLA) and Tencor Instruments (Tencor), two long-time leaders in the semiconductor equipment industry. Prior to the merger, both businesses served a segment of the inspection and metrology area; with KLA focused on defect inspection solutions and Tencor placing its emphasis on metrology solutions. Merging together in a one-to-one stock swap valued at $1.3 billion, KLA-Tencor became the most important process control player in the industry, bringing to market a complete line of yield management products and services from a single company.

KLA was named after its founders, Ken Levy and Bob Anderson. The word “Tencor” came about because the founder of Tencor, Karel Urbanek, wanted a two syllable name that would be easy to remember.

KLA Instruments was first established in 1975, with its first product emerging on the market in 1978—an automated inspection system that reduced photomask inspection time from eight hours to 15 minutes. Shortly thereafter, KLA Instruments went public and expanded its inspection product portfolio to include patterned wafer inspection systems. Two years later, KLA further broadened its offerings into the wafer metrology business through optical overlay and line-width measurement systems. During the subsequent few years, the company expanded its product base through the development of software solutions to help integrate inspection and measurement data for analysis—ultimately forming the industry’s first yield management software services group to provide customers with expertise in yield enhancement through engineering consulting services.

1977, Tencor Instruments established its name, and first introduced its yield management product—the Alpha-Step stylus surface profiler—just seven months later. This yield management solution provided significant improvement in step-height measurement, a critical parameter in measuring film layer thickness. In 1984, Tencor Instruments launched its first Surfscan product—a particle and contamination defect system based on laser scanning technology, which soon became the production standard. By the late 1990s, Tencor had broadened its yield management product offerings to also include defect review and data analysis tools. Following an initial public offering in 1993, Tencor then acquired Prometrix, a leading supplier of thin-film measurement solutions, and further expanded its yield management product offering. At the time of its merger with KLA, Tencor had revenues of approximately $403 million and 1,400 employees around the world

Business summary
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. engages in the manufacture and sale of integrated circuits and wafer semiconductor devices. Its chips are used in personal computers and peripheral products; information applications; wired and wireless communications systems products; automotive and industrial equipment including consumer electronics such as digital video compact disc player, digital television, game consoles, and digital cameras. The company was founded by Chung Mou Chang on February 21, 1987 and is headquartered in Hsinchu, Taiwan.
Company background
Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg., better known as TSMC, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry.

     It receives orders to make large-scale integrated circuits for smartphones, in addition to a variety of semiconductors for PCs and TVs.

     According to U.S. research company Gartner, TSMC accounted for 53.7% of the market for semiconductor production outsourcing in 2014.

     TSMC was established in 1987 at the initiative of the Taiwanese government to promote the country's semiconductor industry.

     Morris Chang, the de facto founder and chairman, had served as group vice president at U.S. chipmaker Texas Instruments before taking the chairmanship at TSMC, by request of the government.

     TSMC was the first in the world to specialize in semiconductor production outsourcing; it gets most of its orders from U.S. brands. In 2014, it contracted with Apple to make central processing units for the iPhone, significantly raising earnings.

     The company, which also has plants in China and Singapore, faces a challenging future. In January of 2015, it sold its unprofitable light-emitting diode business. It must foster new businesses.

     Chang is a charismatic corporate manager, but the market is closely watching for when the 80-something businessman retires from the managerial front line.
