For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Takes Various Actions on SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-10 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Takes Various Actions on SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-10
    





June 22, 2016 10:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on SLM Student Loan 
      Trust 2004-10 (SLM 2004-10):
    

      --Class A-5A 'AAAsf' placed on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class A-5B 'AAAsf' placed on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class A-6A 'AAAsf' placed on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class A-6B 'AAAsf' placed on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class A-7A 'AAAsf' maintained on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class A-7B 'AAAsf' maintained on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class A-8 'AAAsf' maintained on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class B 'BBBsf' placed on Rating Watch Negative.
    

      The class A-8 note is Euro-denominated. At issuance, a currency swap 
      agreement was entered into by the trust to mitigate foreign exchange 
      exposure risk arising from the mismatch between U.S. dollar assets of 
      the trust and the Eurodollar liabilities of class A-8. The swap 
      counterparty's Issuer Default Rating is now below the minimum threshold 
      specified in Fitch's counterparty criteria. Fitch is currently in the 
      process of examining the sufficiency of arrangements for 
      collateralization of the swap.
    

      In the event of the swap termination, the trust will be exposed to 
      exchange rate risk between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro. A significant 
      increase in the A-8 interest payment, caused by a depreciating dollar, 
      could reduce the collection funds available for interest and principal 
      payments, resulting in an increased risk of default for all outstanding 
      bonds.
    

      Additionally, the placement of the A-7, A-8 and B notes on Negative 
      Watch is due to their inability to pass cash flow stresses necessary to 
      maintain their current ratings. On Dec. 4, 2015, Fitch released an 
      exposure draft that delineates revisions it plans to make to the 'Rating 
      U.S. Federal Family Education Loan Program Student Loan ABS Criteria', 
      dated June 23, 2014. This transaction was reviewed under both the 
      existing criteria and exposure draft.
    

      Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch Negative status once its 
      revised FFELP criteria report is published and further review of the 
      collateral information posted by AIG Financial Products Corporation is 
      completed.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Collateral Quality: The trust collateral consists of 100% of Federal 
      Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans. The credit quality of the 
      trust collateral is high, in Fitch's opinion, based on the guarantees 
      provided by the transaction's eligible guarantors and reinsurance 
      provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for at least 97% of 
      principal and accrued interest. Fitch currently rates the U.S. 'AAA' 
      with a Stable Outlook.
    

      Credit Enhancement: While both senior and subordinate notes will benefit 
      from future excess spread, the senior notes also benefit from 
      subordination provided by the class B notes. As of March 2016, total 
      parity is 100.00% and senior parity is 104.60% (4.40% CE). Cash is being 
      released from the trust given that the 100% total parity is maintained.
    

      Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided by a reserve account. 
      The reserve is sized equal to the greater of 0.25% of the pool balance, 
      and $5,850,157.
    

      Servicing Capabilities: Navient Solutions, Inc. (FKA Sallie Mae, Inc.) 
      is responsible for the day to day servicing of the student loans. Fitch 
      believes Navient Solutions to be an acceptable servicer of FFELP student 
      loans.
    

      In December 2015, Fitch released an exposure draft that delineates 
      revisions it plans to make to the 'Rating U.S. Federal Family Education 
      Loan Program Student Loan ABS Criteria', dated June 23, 2014. Fitch has 
      reviewed transactions under both the existing and proposed criteria.
    

      On June 9, 2016, Fitch published a press release titled 'Fitch 
      Finalizing Changes to FFELP Student Loan ABS Criteria' that details 
      likely changes to the final criteria report, which it expects to publish 
      in less than 60 days.
    

      CRITERIA VARIATIONS
    

      In certain LIBOR-down interest rate stress scenarios the basis spread 
      may be compressed, as Fitch would apply a floor to one-month LIBOR at a 
      negative rate level in accordance with Fitch's 'Criteria for Interest 
      Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds' (May 
      2016). Since the updated interest rate stresses are not addressed yet in 
      existing FFELP criteria, this represents a criteria variation. Use of 
      the criteria variation did not have a measurable impact upon the ratings 
      assigned.
    

      Under the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds', dated May 14, 2014, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The 
      definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the 
      possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a 
      criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest in are 
      those held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only be invested 
      for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the 
      notes, Fitch doesn't believe such variation has a measurable impact upon 
      the ratings assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since the FFELP student loan ABS relies on the U.S. government to 
      reimburse defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem 
      with the 'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign 
      rating, defaults, basis risk, and loan extension risk account for the 
      majority of the risk embedded in FFELP student loan transactions. 
      Additional defaults, basis shock beyond Fitch's published stresses, 
      lower than expected payment speed, and other factors could result in 
      future downgrades. Likewise, a buildup of CE driven by positive excess 
      spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future 
      upgrades.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

      Fitch Affirms Ratings on SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-10
    





June 15, 2011 05:03 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings affirms the senior student loan-backed notes at 'AAAsf' 
      and affirms the subordinate student loan-backed note at 'BBsf' issued by 
      SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-10. The collateral supporting the notes is 
      comprised of student loans originated under the Federal Family Education 
      Loan Program (FFELP). The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full rating list 
      is shown below.
    

      Fitch affirms the ratings on the SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-10 senior 
      and subordinate notes based on the sufficient level of credit 
      enhancement to cover the applicable risk factor stresses. Credit 
      enhancement for the senior and subordinate notes consists of 
      overcollateralization and projected minimum excess spread, while the 
      senior notes also benefit from subordination provided by the class B 
      notes.
    

      The loans are serviced and originated by SLM Corp. SLM Corp. provides 
      funds for educational loans, primarily federal guaranteed student loans 
      originated under the FFELP. SLM Corp. and its subsidiaries are not 
      sponsored by or are agencies of the U.S. government. Fitch currently 
      rates SLM Corp. with long- and short-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) 
      of 'BBB-' and 'F3', respectively.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-10 Student Loan-Backed Notes:
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5A at 'AAAsf/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5B at 'AAAsf/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-6A at 'AAAsf/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-6B at 'AAAsf/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-7A at 'AAAsf/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-7B at 'AAAsf/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
