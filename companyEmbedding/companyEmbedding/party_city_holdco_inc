Company Overview & Strategy





Click here to learn more about our business.

Party City is the leading party goods and Halloween specialty retailer by revenue in North America and, we believe, the world’s largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods with multiple levers to drive future growth across channels, products and geographies.
Party City operates over 900 company-owned and franchise stores throughout North America. Our worldwide locations include our corporate headquarters in Elmsford, New York as well as locations throughout Asia, Europe, the Americas and Australia. The company also sells direct to customers through its e-commerce website, PartyCity.com.
We design, manufacture and distribute party goods found in over 40,000 retail outlets worldwide, including Party City stores as well as independent party supply stores, mass merchants, grocery retailers, dollar stores and others.
Through a series of acquisitions between 2005 and today, we have built a powerful retail operation that captures the full manufacturing-to-retail margin on a significant portion of the products sold in our stores. Our category-defining retail concept, multi-channel reach, widely recognized brands, broad and deep product offering, and low-cost global sourcing model are, we believe, significant competitive advantages which position us for continued organic and acquisition-led growth and margin expansion.

Company Overview & Strategy





Click here to learn more about our business.

Party City is the leading party goods and Halloween specialty retailer by revenue in North America and, we believe, the world’s largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods with multiple levers to drive future growth across channels, products and geographies.
Party City operates over 900 company-owned and franchise stores throughout North America. Our worldwide locations include our corporate headquarters in Elmsford, New York as well as locations throughout Asia, Europe, the Americas and Australia. The company also sells direct to customers through its e-commerce website, PartyCity.com.
We design, manufacture and distribute party goods found in over 40,000 retail outlets worldwide, including Party City stores as well as independent party supply stores, mass merchants, grocery retailers, dollar stores and others.
Through a series of acquisitions between 2005 and today, we have built a powerful retail operation that captures the full manufacturing-to-retail margin on a significant portion of the products sold in our stores. Our category-defining retail concept, multi-channel reach, widely recognized brands, broad and deep product offering, and low-cost global sourcing model are, we believe, significant competitive advantages which position us for continued organic and acquisition-led growth and margin expansion.

Company Overview & Strategy





Click here to learn more about our business.

Party City is the leading party goods and Halloween specialty retailer by revenue in North America and, we believe, the world’s largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods with multiple levers to drive future growth across channels, products and geographies.
Party City operates over 900 company-owned and franchise stores throughout North America. Our worldwide locations include our corporate headquarters in Elmsford, New York as well as locations throughout Asia, Europe, the Americas and Australia. The company also sells direct to customers through its e-commerce website, PartyCity.com.
We design, manufacture and distribute party goods found in over 40,000 retail outlets worldwide, including Party City stores as well as independent party supply stores, mass merchants, grocery retailers, dollar stores and others.
Through a series of acquisitions between 2005 and today, we have built a powerful retail operation that captures the full manufacturing-to-retail margin on a significant portion of the products sold in our stores. Our category-defining retail concept, multi-channel reach, widely recognized brands, broad and deep product offering, and low-cost global sourcing model are, we believe, significant competitive advantages which position us for continued organic and acquisition-led growth and margin expansion.

Company Overview & Strategy





Click here to learn more about our business.

Party City is the leading party goods and Halloween specialty retailer by revenue in North America and, we believe, the world’s largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods with multiple levers to drive future growth across channels, products and geographies.
Party City operates over 900 company-owned and franchise stores throughout North America. Our worldwide locations include our corporate headquarters in Elmsford, New York as well as locations throughout Asia, Europe, the Americas and Australia. The company also sells direct to customers through its e-commerce website, PartyCity.com.
We design, manufacture and distribute party goods found in over 40,000 retail outlets worldwide, including Party City stores as well as independent party supply stores, mass merchants, grocery retailers, dollar stores and others.
Through a series of acquisitions between 2005 and today, we have built a powerful retail operation that captures the full manufacturing-to-retail margin on a significant portion of the products sold in our stores. Our category-defining retail concept, multi-channel reach, widely recognized brands, broad and deep product offering, and low-cost global sourcing model are, we believe, significant competitive advantages which position us for continued organic and acquisition-led growth and margin expansion.

History[edit]
Founded by Steve Mandell in 1986, Mandell recognized that party goods was highly fragmented with a lot of small mom-and-pop operations, a large number of retailers carrying limited supplies, and no big players dominating the market. Mandell decided to specialize in the business when he struck out on his own to realize his long-cherished goal of running his own retail operation. After scraping together $125,000, he opened a 4,000 square feet (370 m2) store in East Hanover, New Jersey, naming it Party City. The operation was immediately successful and within a year Mandell started planning for a second location. He also began to hear from people asking to franchise the Party City concept, and as a result Party City began its evolution into a national chain. After his first year in business Mandell also decided to concentrate on Halloween, so that in 1987 a quarter of his store was turned into a "Halloween Costume Warehouse." The move proved highly successful and led to the company's ongoing focus on the holiday, and the major impact that the month of October would have on the company's bottom line. Year-round, Party City stocked an inventory of Halloween costumes, if for no other reason than to make customers aware of the items for the next Halloween season.[4]
The first Party City franchise store opened in 1989 in Hazlet, NJ[5] and by 1990 Mandell also owned four Party City stores. At this point he incorporated the business as a franchising operation, with his stores forming the core of the chain. By the end of 1990, Party City outlets numbered 11; five more franchised stores were added in 1991, 16 in 1992, and another 26 in 1993, bringing the total to 58. Party City was now a nationwide chain with store locations ranging from Hawaii to Puerto Rico. The company's annual revenues in 1993 topped $2.4 million and net profits approached $235,000. During these first four years of operation, Mandell refined the Party City concept, including store design, product mix, choice of suppliers, and the implementation of systems. With a successful store model in hand, Mandell in late 1993 decided to de-emphasize franchising in favor of opening company-owned stores, which would generate greater returns for the corporation than it could receive on fees and royalties from franchised outlets, as well as allow Mandell to better control the destiny of Party City. While franchisees might maintain a tighter control on inventory, Mandell was insistent that company-owned units would be amply stocked with a wide range of merchandise.[4][5]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company was sold to Amscan Holdings, Inc., the largest designer, manufacturer and distributor of party goods in America.[6] Amscan then went on to acquire the party retailers Party America in 2006 and Factory Card & Party Outlet in 2007. Both retail chains began to operate under the Party City network, thereby making Party City the largest party supplies retailer in the United States.[7]
With Amscan’s 2011 acquisition of American Greetings’ Designware party division, Party City added licensing agreements with Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop, and Hasbro.[8] In 2011, Amscan became a licensee for MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL and NCAA party products and balloons, and Party City carries all teams in their respective markets and offers the entire assortment in larger stores and online.[9]
In 2009, Party City launched an e-commerce website at PartyCity.com and in 2011 added a “Party Ideas” Center containing shopping checklists, photo galleries and video tutorials.[10]
In 2011, Party City expanded outside the United States with the acquisition of the Canadian retailer Party Packagers, making Party City the largest party goods retailer in North America. In 2012, these stores began to re-brand as Party City. In 2013 Party City bought iParty, a now defunct discount party super store that had locations in both New England and the Tampa Bay Florida area.
Philanthropy[edit]
Party City has given back to the community, in the form of launching a website called PartyCityCares.
Party City has also begun sponsoring PBS television shows including Sesame Street.[11]

The move proved highly successful and led to the company's ongoing focus on the holiday, and the major impact that the month of October would have on the company's bottom line. Year-round, Party City stocked an inventory of Halloween costumes, if for no other reason than to make customers aware of the items for the next Halloween season.[4]
The first Party City franchise store opened in 1989 in Hazlet, NJ[5] and by 1990 Mandell also owned four Party City stores. At this point he incorporated the business as a franchising operation, with his stores forming the core of the chain. By the end of 1990, Party City outlets numbered 11; five more franchised stores were added in 1991, 16 in 1992, and another 26 in 1993, bringing the total to 58. Party City was now a nationwide chain with store locations ranging from Hawaii to Puerto Rico. The company's annual revenues in 1993 topped $2.4 million and net profits approached $235,000. During these first four years of operation, Mandell refined the Party City concept, including store design, product mix, choice of suppliers, and the implementation of systems. With a successful store model in hand, Mandell in late 1993 decided to de-emphasize franchising in favor of opening company-owned stores, which would generate greater returns for the corporation than it could receive on fees and royalties from franchised outlets, as well as allow Mandell to better control the destiny of Party City. While franchisees might maintain a tighter control on inventory, Mandell was insistent that company-owned units would be amply stocked with a wide range of merchandise.[4][5]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company was sold to Amscan Holdings, Inc., the largest designer, manufacturer and distributor of party goods in America.[6] Amscan then went on to acquire the party retailers Party America in 2006 and Factory Card & Party Outlet in 2007. Both retail chains began to operate under the Party City network, thereby making Party City the largest party supplies retailer in the United States.[7]
With Amscan’s 2011 acquisition of American Greetings’ Designware party division, Party City added licensing agreements with Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop, and Hasbro.[8] In 2011, Amscan became a licensee for MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL and NCAA party products and balloons, and Party City carries all teams in their respective markets and offers the entire assortment in larger stores and online.[9]
In 2009, Party City launched an e-commerce website at PartyCity.com and in 2011 added a “Party Ideas” Center containing shopping checklists, photo galleries and video tutorials.[10]
In 2011, Party City expanded outside the United States with the acquisition of the Canadian retailer Party Packagers, making Party City the largest party goods retailer in North America. In 2012, these stores began to re-brand as Party City. In 2013 Party City bought iParty, a now defunct discount party super store that had locations in both New England and the Tampa Bay Florida area.
Philanthropy[edit]
Party City has given back to the community, in the form of launching a website called PartyCityCares.
Party City has also begun sponsoring PBS television shows including Sesame Street.[11]

The Short Case For Party City - Party City Holdco, Inc. (NYSE:PRTY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Short Case For Party CityJun.16.17 | About: Party City (PRTY) Short Investor Common Equity, Short




SummaryManagement expects to return to positive comps in 2017, expand internationally, and expand margins - research suggests this is highly unlikely due to significant competitive encroachment and poor business strategy.Specifically, online pricing is uncompetitive, and growth "initiatives" are simply not working.Target price of $8 represents the midpoint of structurally impaired specialty retailers based on P/E.Target Price and Rationale Management expects to return to positive comps in 2017, expand internationally, and expand margins. My research suggests that this is highly unlikely due to significant competitive encroachment and poor business strategy. Specifically, online pricing is uncompetitive, and growth "initiatives" are simply not working. Target price represents the midpoint of structurally impaired specialty retailers based on P/E. Relevant Comps Michaels Companies (NASDAQ:MIK), Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), GameStop (NYSE:GME), Vitamin Shoppe (NYSE:VSI), GNC (NYSE:GNC) Catalyst Q1 2017 earnings in late May/June will be another catalyst confirming the thesis. Management continues to suggest comps can reaccelerate, and each successive disappointment will lead to additional devaluation. The most pivotal catalyst will be Q3 2017 earnings during which management discusses Halloween trends (25% of revs). A significant earnings warning on the Q3 call would likely push shares close to the PT or possibly lower to extreme bear case ($5.50). Company Overview: Party City Holdco Inc. (NYSE:PRTY) designs, manufactures, sources, and distributes party supplies in the US and internationally. The company operates in two segments – Retail and Wholesale. The company offered its products through its ~900 stores (~150 franchise stores in the US and Canada under the Party City and Halloween City names) and an e-commerce website (PartyCity.com). Ticker: PRTY | Stock Price (4/6/2017): $14.50 | Market Cap: $1.8bn | Short Interest: 4.7% First, the Bull Case:  Dominant Market Share 16% of estimated $10 billion US party supply industry 910 stores, including franchises   New Market Opportunities International growth: Mexico presence to increase from five stores in 2016 to 80 stores in 2024 Alternative markets: Opportunity to grow wholesale revenues by selling party goods to theaters, theme parks, etc.   Vertical IntegrationPenetration of Retail + Wholesale + Manufacturing value chain expected to increase from 75% to 80% and drive 200bps of Gross Margin Improvement  Attractive Valuation 12x 2016 Earnings 8.8% 2016 FCF Yield 8x 2016 EV/EBITDA   
 On the surface, these factors suggest PRTY is a good investment. This is reflected in a relatively low short interest for a brick and mortar retailer in the current environment and makes PRTY an out of consensus short. However, a detailed analysis suggests that there is significant risk. Bear Case: PRTY is on the cusp of losing significant market share E-Commerce: PRTY derives just 7% of sales online. Management believes that this is because it “offers a fun and unique destination shopping experience creating a strong and growing need for brick and mortar.” (Slide 8 of 2017 ICR Conference) Our view is that this is simply not true. Parents planning a Frozen themed birthday for their seven-year-old daughter are far more likely to prefer purchasing online rather than deal with the trials of bringing their young child to a brick and mortar store. A search for “frozen party supplies” on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) turned up 9,632 results, and PRTY would not be the first retailer to get “Amazoned.” However, the risks don’t stop there. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) purchased key competitor Oriental Trading in 2012 even though PRTY was clearly for sale and was purchased by THL that same year. Mr. Buffett was clearly onto something as Oriental Trading stated at the time of the acquisition that it was already generating 70% of its revenues online. Today, Oriental Trading appears to be as competitive as ever. A quick search of “frozen party supplies” found the following: Oriental Trading features prominently at the top with a large selection of Frozen themed party supplies owning 100% of Google Shopping listings. PRTY holds only one text ad. Even more alarming, there are plenty of other sites that are competitive. On consumer research site www.knoji.com, PRTY ranks 28th in overall quality on a list of 50 online party goods suppliers. 

Pricing: PRTY is simply not competitive on pricing. A quick search around the web shows that there are quality options available to consumers at a fraction of the prices listed at PRTY. Sticking with the Frozen theme, we compared Frozen party supplies on Amazon and on www.partycity.com. Management has highlighted its party kits, which essentially bundle a set of party supplies for consumers to help them avoid purchasing random quantities of cups, napkins, utensils, etc. a la carte. It seemed like a good idea, but the competition has clearly caught up:
 

 Amazon sells the kit for $13.13 (including shipping) compared to $21.99. The $9 difference can essentially be attributed to 15 latex balloons and some candles. Unfortunately, those balloons actually come with a disclaimer (as shown in image) that they are a choking hazard for children under 8 and will require adult supervision. Our view is that child birthday parties are stressful enough for most parents, and they may prefer to save $9 while avoiding the risk of serious bodily harm to their children. We tried many other searches for basic party supplies, and there were materially cheaper alternatives to PRTY readily available online in all instances (most significantly so). Halloween: PRTY still derives approximately 25% of annual sales from Halloween, primarily costumes. Management attributes weak October 2016 comps (-6.5%) due to a calendar shift from Saturday in 2015 to Monday in 2016. There is obviously some impact, but considering October 2015 comps were only up 3.3%, two-year comps of -3.2% are alarming. Of course, management attributed uninspiring 2015 comps to “tough” Frozen comps. The reality is, competition is increasingly encroaching on PRTY’s most important source of revenue. As evidence, we point to the National Retail Federation (NRF) estimated that Halloween spending actually hit a new high in 2016 of $8.4 billion compared to $6.9 billion in 2015 and $7.4 billion in 2014. The NRF further suggests that costumes were a key contributor to growth, but PRTY clearly underperformed. Another quick search for “Anna girl’s costume” at www.partycity.com and Amazon produces some alarming results: 




 Some little girls might argue that they get a pink cape from PCTY, but note that the cape is sold separately ($9.99 before shipping). This leaves an apples-to-apples price difference of over 50% ($24.99 vs. $10.80) on one of the most popular Halloween costumes and likely serves as a better explanation of recent challenges. Alternative markets and International growth are challenging and do not move the needle. Mexico: PRTY is placing significant emphasis on international growth and Mexico in particular. The asset light approach is a positive, but success is far from certain. Based on Google trends, mindshare of Party City in Mexico continues to trend lower despite management commentary and the recent acquisition of an 85% stake in Granmark: 

 All told, wholesale international revenues have increased just 3% per annum from $210 million in FY2012 to $235 million in FY2016 despite years of management hype. Foreign exchange headwinds have contributed to this slow growth rate, but even an abatement there is highly unlikely to accelerate overall corporate revenue growth. It’s also important to note that e-commerce is a global phenomenon, and the same headwinds facing PRTY in the US are also likely to exist in Mexico as well as other key international markets such as Australia and the UK. New markets: Sell-side analysts have been fixated on selling through new points of sale such as movie theaters. Management has oozed enthusiasm about this opportunity, as shown in this exchange in Q3 2016: 


 But after conjuring a castle in the sky, management appears to backtrack a quarter later (Q4 2016): 

 In essence, management went from implying that there is a “huge” new market opportunity to conceding it may sell a few extra balloons to Frozen obsessed little girls at movie theaters. Even assuming the 10% growth rate were to persist, it would only contribute a “huge” $6 million in additional revenue or just under 0.3%. In reality, even this is unlikely given the initial euphoria for Frozen and sell into new points of sale are more likely to plateau. Vertical integration is not enough. Management has gone to great lengths expand wholesale distribution and acquire manufacturing capacity. To some extent, the strategy appears to have worked. Gross margins increased from 40.0% in FY2012 to 40.7% in FY2016. By comparison, peer Michaels Companies has seen gross margins contract from 40.0% in FY2012 to 39.1% in FY2016. Unfortunately, progress has clearly slowed in recent years. PRTY’s gross margins already reached 40.3% in FY2013, which is not significantly different from today despite a continued ramp in vertical integration from 66% in FY2012 to 77% in FY2016. In a blue sky scenario, management sees an additional 200bps of gross margin expansion in retail stores (~70% of revenues) when PRTY is fully integrated. Additional initiatives such as the acquisition of a new manufacturing facility in Madagascar will help, but PRTY appears to be bringing a knife to a gunfight. Any efficiency gains will likely need to be entirely traded away to remain competitive on price. PRTY also benefited in FY2016 from exceptionally depressed input costs, particularly resins and diesel. The high level of vertical integration likely allowed the company to better capture deflationary raw material benefits than peers. However, this dynamic has already begun to reverse and will put additional pressure on gross margins going forward. On balance, we think it’s reasonable to assume margins remain flat in FY2017 as pushes ahead with additional manufacturing capacity. By FY2018, headwinds are expected to overwhelm efficiency, and margins should begin a long march lower.
 Valuation: Markets appear to be pricing virtually none of the many risks and are instead fixated on the bull case. Our model better reflects the true state of PRTY’s business: 

 Based on peer multiples ranging from 5x to 11x 2017 earnings, elevated leverage, and deteriorating metrics, we estimate PRTY should trade at $8.00(~45% downside). If business deteriorates faster than expected, shares could trade at $5.50 in the next 6-12 months. 

 Other Risks Potential Risks to Earnings Outlook:  Highly levered (4.2x EBITDA) with 81% floating rate debt High PE Ownership (55% TH Lee, 19% Advent) Significant Management Turnover New CFO New EVP of Retail    Conclusion: PRTY is a structurally impaired business and will not adapt to rapidly evolving industry dynamics. It has chosen to focus on growth vectors that are proving difficult to execute and unlikely to accelerate sales growth. As a result, the company looks set to be a share donor and not a share gainer. Margins are also likely to be under pressure due to the significant gap to competitor pricing. We expect domestic same store sales will likely continue to deteriorate and not accelerate as management has suggested.

03/14/2016

Download this Press Release ()


 ELMSFORD, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Party City Holdco Inc. (the “Company" or "Party City") (NYSE:PRTY), the
      leading vertically integrated party goods company in North America,
      announces that it has acquired Festival SA (“Festival”), a manufacturer
      of costumes and accessories.
    

      Under the agreement the Company purchased the stock of Festival, which
      operates a 107,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in
      Madagascar, for a cash purchase price of approximately $5 million. In
      conjunction with the acquisition, the Company has entered into a supply
      agreement with Cesar, the previous owner, who will continue to purchase
      an agreed upon minimum level of product manufactured by Festival.
    

Jim Harrison, CEO of Party City Holdco Inc. said, “The Festival
      transaction is an important step in the Company’s long history of
      successful bolt-on acquisitions which have served to deepen our vertical
      business model, a key component of our growth strategy. This acquisition
      will allow us to source up to 15% of our costume and accessory
      requirements over the next several years and capture the full
      manufacturing-to-retail margin on these products.”

Despite an unfavorable calendar shift affecting Halloween, our most important holiday, we were able to deliver our 7th straight year of record revenues in constant currency as a result of our diversified revenue model that reaches across multiple channels. We are pleased that 2016 was also our 16th consecutive year of record EBITDA, which has been driven by consistently growing our share of shelf1 and continually increasing our operational
efficiencies.  Highlights for Full Year 2016:   


 

 
Reported net income increased to a record $117 million; while adjusted net income increased 21% to $138 million   


 

 
Reported EPS improved to $0.98, while adjusted EPS increased 14%, to $1.15   


 

 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% to a record $390 million   


 

 
Expanded store base by opening/acquiring 48 new stores (38 net of closures) in the U.S. and Canada   


 

 
Generated free cash flow2 of $308 million and reduced leverage3 from 4.6 times to 4.1 times 
 


 

 
Generated cash interest savings of approximately $57 million in 2016 as a result of the application of our IPO proceeds towards debt reduction and the successful refinancing of our debt in both 2015 and 2016
 Mr. Harrison continued, We have many opportunities ahead of us in all aspects of our business to drive growth and further create
value. We will continue to execute our growth strategy which includes manufacturing more of what we sell, growing our presence in international markets and alternative channels, adding accretive acquisitions, growing our store base, and enhancing
the customer experience, both in-store and online. Our continued focus on these key initiatives will serve to position us for long-term, sustainable growth.

Party City is an American publicly traded retail chain of party supply stores founded in 1986 by Steve Mandell in East Hanover, New Jersey. Based in Elmsford, New York, the company is the largest retailer of party goods in the United States and Canada, operating over 900 company-owned and franchise outlets under the Party City, Halloween City, and Factory Card & Party Outlet brands.[3]

History[edit]
Founded by Steve Mandell in 1986, Mandell recognized that party goods was highly fragmented with a lot of small mom-and-pop operations, a large number of retailers carrying limited supplies, and no big players dominating the market. Mandell decided to specialize in the business when he struck out on his own to realize his long-cherished goal of running his own retail operation. After scraping together $125,000, he opened a 4,000 square feet (370 m2) store in East Hanover, New Jersey, naming it Party City. The operation was immediately successful and within a year Mandell started planning for a second location. He also began to hear from people asking to franchise the Party City concept, and as a result Party City began its evolution into a national chain. After his first year in business Mandell also decided to concentrate on Halloween, so that in 1987 a quarter of his store was turned into a "Halloween Costume Warehouse." The move proved highly successful and led to the company's ongoing focus on the holiday, and the major impact that the month of October would have on the company's bottom line. Year-round, Party City stocked an inventory of Halloween costumes, if for no other reason than to make customers aware of the items for the next Halloween season.[4]
The first Party City franchise store opened in 1989 in Hazlet, NJ[5] and by 1990 Mandell also owned four Party City stores. At this point he incorporated the business as a franchising operation, with his stores forming the core of the chain. By the end of 1990, Party City outlets numbered 11; five more franchised stores were added in 1991, 16 in 1992, and another 26 in 1993, bringing the total to 58. Party City was now a nationwide chain with store locations ranging from Hawaii to Puerto Rico. The company's annual revenues in 1993 topped $2.4 million and net profits approached $235,000. During these first four years of operation, Mandell refined the Party City concept, including store design, product mix, choice of suppliers, and the implementation of systems. With a successful store model in hand, Mandell in late 1993 decided to de-emphasize franchising in favor of opening company-owned stores, which would generate greater returns for the corporation than it could receive on fees and royalties from franchised outlets, as well as allow Mandell to better control the destiny of Party City. While franchisees might maintain a tighter control on inventory, Mandell was insistent that company-owned units would be amply stocked with a wide range of merchandise.[4][5]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company was sold to Amscan Holdings, Inc., the largest designer, manufacturer and distributor of party goods in America.[6] Amscan then went on to acquire the party retailers Party America in 2006 and Factory Card & Party Outlet in 2007. Both retail chains began to operate under the Party City network, thereby making Party City the largest party supplies retailer in the United States.[7]
With Amscan’s 2011 acquisition of American Greetings’ Designware party division, Party City added licensing agreements with Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop, and Hasbro.[8] In 2011, Amscan became a licensee for MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL and NCAA party products and balloons, and Party City carries all teams in their respective markets and offers the entire assortment in larger stores and online.[9]
In 2009, Party City launched an e-commerce website at PartyCity.com and in 2011 added a “Party Ideas” Center containing shopping checklists, photo galleries and video tutorials.[10]
In 2011, Party City expanded outside the United States with the acquisition of the Canadian retailer Party Packagers, making Party City the largest party goods retailer in North America. In 2012, these stores began to re-brand as Party City. In 2013 Party City bought iParty, a now defunct discount party super store that had locations in both New England and the Tampa Bay Florida area.
Philanthropy[edit]
Party City has given back to the community, in the form of launching a website called PartyCityCares.
Party City has also begun sponsoring PBS television shows including Sesame Street.[11]

Party City is an American publicly traded retail chain of party supply stores founded in 1986 by Steve Mandell in East Hanover, New Jersey. Based in Elmsford, New York, the company is the largest retailer of party goods in the United States and Canada, operating over 900 company-owned and franchise outlets under the Party City, Halloween City, and Factory Card & Party Outlet brands.[3]

History[edit]
Founded by Steve Mandell in 1986, Mandell recognized that party goods was highly fragmented with a lot of small mom-and-pop operations, a large number of retailers carrying limited supplies, and no big players dominating the market. Mandell decided to specialize in the business when he struck out on his own to realize his long-cherished goal of running his own retail operation. After scraping together $125,000, he opened a 4,000 square feet (370 m2) store in East Hanover, New Jersey, naming it Party City. The operation was immediately successful and within a year Mandell started planning for a second location. He also began to hear from people asking to franchise the Party City concept, and as a result Party City began its evolution into a national chain. After his first year in business Mandell also decided to concentrate on Halloween, so that in 1987 a quarter of his store was turned into a "Halloween Costume Warehouse." The move proved highly successful and led to the company's ongoing focus on the holiday, and the major impact that the month of October would have on the company's bottom line. Year-round, Party City stocked an inventory of Halloween costumes, if for no other reason than to make customers aware of the items for the next Halloween season.[4]
The first Party City franchise store opened in 1989 in Hazlet, NJ[5] and by 1990 Mandell also owned four Party City stores. At this point he incorporated the business as a franchising operation, with his stores forming the core of the chain. By the end of 1990, Party City outlets numbered 11; five more franchised stores were added in 1991, 16 in 1992, and another 26 in 1993, bringing the total to 58. Party City was now a nationwide chain with store locations ranging from Hawaii to Puerto Rico. The company's annual revenues in 1993 topped $2.4 million and net profits approached $235,000. During these first four years of operation, Mandell refined the Party City concept, including store design, product mix, choice of suppliers, and the implementation of systems. With a successful store model in hand, Mandell in late 1993 decided to de-emphasize franchising in favor of opening company-owned stores, which would generate greater returns for the corporation than it could receive on fees and royalties from franchised outlets, as well as allow Mandell to better control the destiny of Party City. While franchisees might maintain a tighter control on inventory, Mandell was insistent that company-owned units would be amply stocked with a wide range of merchandise.[4][5]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company was sold to Amscan Holdings, Inc., the largest designer, manufacturer and distributor of party goods in America.[6] Amscan then went on to acquire the party retailers Party America in 2006 and Factory Card & Party Outlet in 2007. Both retail chains began to operate under the Party City network, thereby making Party City the largest party supplies retailer in the United States.[7]
With Amscan’s 2011 acquisition of American Greetings’ Designware party division, Party City added licensing agreements with Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop, and Hasbro.[8] In 2011, Amscan became a licensee for MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL and NCAA party products and balloons, and Party City carries all teams in their respective markets and offers the entire assortment in larger stores and online.[9]
In 2009, Party City launched an e-commerce website at PartyCity.com and in 2011 added a “Party Ideas” Center containing shopping checklists, photo galleries and video tutorials.[10]
In 2011, Party City expanded outside the United States with the acquisition of the Canadian retailer Party Packagers, making Party City the largest party goods retailer in North America. In 2012, these stores began to re-brand as Party City. In 2013 Party City bought iParty, a now defunct discount party super store that had locations in both New England and the Tampa Bay Florida area.
Philanthropy[edit]
Party City has given back to the community, in the form of launching a website called PartyCityCares.
Party City has also begun sponsoring PBS television shows including Sesame Street.[11]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
