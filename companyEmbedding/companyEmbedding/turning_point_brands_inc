Company Overview


























A WELCOME TO TURNING POINT BRANDS FROM CEO LARRY WEXLER


Our organization has built a solid foundation in the Other Tobacco Products (OTP) Category by successfully combining a diverse portfolio of well-known and ground-breaking new brands with a highly effective sales and distribution network.


Our tobacco portfolio features iconic, historical brands Zig-Zag®, Beech-Nut® and Stoker’s®. The world famous Zig-Zag® brand has a proud heritage of leadership dating to 1879. Winner of the 1900 World’s Fair Gold Medal for being the first interleaved Cigarette Paper, it remains a leading premium paper in the United States and Canada today. Over the past decade, Zig-Zag® has entered and been successful in the Make Your Own Cigar and Cigar segments. Beech-Nut®, with a rich history that dates to 1897, remains a formidable competitor in the premium Chewing Tobacco segment. And Stoker's®, with a heritage dating to 1940, has grown to a leading position in Chewing Tobacco and is the fastest-growing Moist Snuff tobacco on the market today.
Determined to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences, we’ve expanded into the high-growth Electronic Vapor segment. We first developed a strategic partnership with VMR, securing retail distribution rights for V2® —a leading on-line electronic cigarette brand. Thanks to the hard work of our highly effective sales organization, V2® is now available in retail stores nationally and has captured a leading share in closed system electronic cigarettes within the stores where it is carried. We are now securing retail distribution of an innovative line of new V2® open system vaporizers and E-liquids. We also developed and launched a line of vaporizers to complement our E-liquids behind the powerful Zig-Zag® brand.
We believe our experienced management team has the ability to utilize our broad portfolio of brands, highly effective sales force and key strategic partnerships to continue providing adult consumers an exciting array of high quality products and increasing stockholder’s value well into the future. Thank you.
Larry Wexler
President & CEO

      on the New York Stock Exchange, and sold at market prices or as
      otherwise agreed with the sales agent. Any net proceeds from the
      offering would be used by TPB to continue developing its business and
      operations, for product development activities and for other general
      corporate purposes.
    
      TPB has filed a shelf registration statement, including a base
      prospectus and a prospectus relating to the at-the-market equity program
      (together with the base prospectus, the “Prospectus”) with the
      Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the common stock offering
      described in this press release. The shares of common stock described in

      statement and are included in the $200,000,000 of securities that may be

      documents TPB has filed with the SEC. These documents may be obtained at
      no cost by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov.
    
      This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a
      solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor will there be any
      sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an
      offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or
      qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other
      jurisdiction. The at-the-market offering may be made only by means of
      the Prospectus.

    Forward-Looking Statements
      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the
      meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements may
      generally be identified by the use of words such as "anticipate,"
      "believe," "expect," "intend," "plan" and "will" or, in each case, their
      negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. These
      forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical
      facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and
      uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances
      that may or may not occur in the future. As a result, actual events may
      differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the
      forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by TPB in
      this press release speaks only as of the date hereof. New risks and
      uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible for TPB to
      predict these events or how they may affect it. TPB has no obligation,
      and does not intend, to update any forward-looking statements after the
      date hereof, except as required by federal securities laws. Factors that
      could cause these differences include, but are not limited to:
    
        declining sales of tobacco products, and expected continuing decline
        of sales, in the tobacco industry overall;
      
        our dependence on a small number of third-party suppliers and
        producers;
      
        the possibility that we will be unable to identify or contract with
        new suppliers or producers in the event of a supply or product
        disruption;
      
        the possibility that our licenses to use certain brands or trademarks
        will be terminated, challenged or restricted;
      
        failure to maintain consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our
        customers;
      
        substantial and increasing U.S. regulation;
      
        regulation of our products by the FDA, which has broad regulatory
        powers;
      
        uncertainty related to the regulation and taxation of our NewGen
        products;
      
        possible significant increases in federal, state and local municipal
        tobacco-related taxes;
      
        possible significant increases in tobacco-related taxes;
      
        possible increasing international control and regulation;
      
        our reliance on relationships with several large retailers and
        national chains for distribution of our products;
      
        intense competition and our ability to compete effectively;
      
        significant potential product liability litigation;
      
        the scientific community’s lack of information regarding the long-term
        health effects of electronic cigarettes, vaporizer and e-liquid use;
      
        our amount of indebtedness;
      
        the terms of our credit facilities, which may restrict our current and
        future operations;
      
        competition from illicit sources;
      
        our reliance on information technology;
      
        security and privacy breaches;
      
        contamination of our tobacco supply or products;
      
        infringement on our intellectual property;
      
        third-party claims that we infringe on their intellectual property;
      
        concentration of business with large customers;
      
        failure to manage our growth;
      
        failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions or otherwise be
        unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions;
      
        failure to achieve expected benefits of the VaporBeast acquisition and
        to integrate VaporBeast’s operations with ours;
      
        fluctuations in our results;
      
        exchange rate fluctuations;
      
        adverse U.S. and global economic conditions;
      
        failure to comply with certain regulations;
      
        departure of key management personnel or our inability to attract and
        retain talent;
      
        decrease in value of our deferred tax assets;
      
        imposition of significant tariffs on imports into the U.S.;
      
        reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth
        companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors,
        potentially decreasing our stock price;
      
        failure to maintain our status as an emerging growth company before
        the five-year maximum time period a company may retain such status;
      
        our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence
        over matters submitted to our stockholders and may take certain
        actions to prevent takeovers;
      
        our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law
        and certain regulations, could discourage or prohibit acquisition bids
        or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of
        our common stock;
      
        our certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of our common
        stock by individuals and entities that are Restricted Investors. These
        restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may
        result in Restricted Investors being required to sell or redeem their
        shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution
        rights;
      
        future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our
        stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale
        of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us;
        and
      
        we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the
        voting power or value of our common stock.

      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the

      forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical 
      facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and 
      uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances 
      that may or may not occur in the future. As a result, actual events may 
      differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the

      and does not intend, to update any forward-looking statements after the 
      date hereof, except as required by federal securities laws. Factors that 
      could cause these differences include, but are not limited to:

        our dependence on a small number of third-party suppliers and 
        producers;

        new suppliers or producers in the event of a supply or product 
        disruption;
      

        the possibility that our licenses to use certain brands or trademarks 
        will be terminated, challenged or restricted;
      

        failure to maintain consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our 
        customers;
      

        substantial and increasing U.S. regulation;
      

        regulation of our products by the FDA, which has broad regulatory 
        powers;
      

        uncertainty related to the regulation and taxation of our NewGen 
        products;
      

        possible significant increases in federal, state and local municipal 
        tobacco-related taxes;
      

        possible significant increases in tobacco-related taxes;
      

        possible increasing international control and regulation;
      

        our reliance on relationships with several large retailers and 
        national chains for distribution of our products;
      

        intense competition and our ability to compete effectively;
      

        significant potential product liability litigation;
      

        the scientific community’s lack of information regarding the long-term 
        health effects of electronic cigarettes, vaporizer and e-liquid use;
      

        our amount of indebtedness;
      

        the terms of our credit facilities, which may restrict our current and 
        future operations;
      

        competition from illicit sources;
      

        our reliance on information technology;
      

        security and privacy breaches;
      

        contamination of our tobacco supply or products;
      

        infringement on our intellectual property;
      

        third-party claims that we infringe on their intellectual property;
      

        concentration of business with large customers;
      

        failure to manage our growth;
      

        failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions or otherwise be 
        unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions;
      

        failure to achieve expected benefits of the VaporBeast acquisition and 
        to integrate VaporBeast’s operations with ours;
      

        fluctuations in our results;
      

        exchange rate fluctuations;
      

        adverse U.S. and global economic conditions;

        departure of key management personnel or our inability to attract and 
        retain talent;
      

        decrease in value of our deferred tax assets;
      

        imposition of significant tariffs on imports into the U.S.;
      

        reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth 
        companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors, 
        potentially decreasing our stock price;
      

        failure to maintain our status as an emerging growth company before 
        the five-year maximum time period a company may retain such status;
      

        our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence 
        over matters submitted to our stockholders and may take certain 
        actions to prevent takeovers;
      

        our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law 
        and certain regulations, could discourage or prohibit acquisition bids 
        or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of 
        our common stock;
      

        our certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of our common 
        stock by individuals and entities that are Restricted Investors. These 
        restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may 
        result in Restricted Investors being required to sell or redeem their 
        shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution 
        rights;
      

        future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our 
        stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale 
        of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us; 
        and
      

        we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the 
        voting power or value of our common stock.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Turning Point Brands, Inc. (NYSE:TPB), a leading provider of Other
      Tobacco Products ("OTP") today announced financial results for the first
      quarter ended March 31, 2017.
    

      "Today marks the one-year anniversary of our initial public offering and
      listing on the NYSE," said TPB President and Chief Executive Officer,
      Larry Wexler. "Over the course of the last twelve months, we have
      produced strong operating results and improved our cash flow, completed
      two acquisitions and refinanced our debt. We expect to continue to
      generate organic growth from our focus brands, Zig-Zag, Stoker's, and
      VaporBeast. We plan to use our strong cash flow to further strengthen
      our brands, reduce our debt and fund acquisitions. We believe that we
      are increasingly well-positioned to continue to grow the business and
      improve our operating performance."
    
First Quarter 2017 Results at a Glance

      (Comparisons vs. first quarter 2016)
    


        Net sales increased 33.9% to a record $66.8 million

        Gross profit increased 12.2% to a record $27.7 million

        Non-recurring non-cash charge on extinguishment of debt associated
        with refinancing incurred in the first quarter of $6.1 million

        Net income of $1.9 million

        Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.5% to $13.6 million (see Schedule A for a
        reconciliation to net income)
      

        Salesforce infrastructure investment continued with manpower for the
        quarter up approximately 7%
      

        Other highlights from the first quarter:

        
            Completed the first full quarter for the Wind River smokeless
            tobacco brands and for the VaporBeast e-commerce business
          
            Increased retail market share in both chewing tobacco and moist
            snuff tobacco ("MST") according to MSAi. (Management Science
            Associates, Inc., "MSAi," administers a proprietary information
            system that captures sales from approximately 1,000 wholesalers to
            over 250,000 retailers. TPB measures "MST" excluding pouch and
            snus products.)
          
            Expanded retail market share in cigarette papers and held an 81%
            share in Make-Your-Own ("MYO") cigar wraps
          
            The quarter had one additional shipping day to the trade versus
            2016
          

Recent Events:


        TPB entered into a strategic partnership with Vapor Shark, a leading
        distributor and manufacturer of premium vaping e-liquids and hardware,
        with nationwide distribution through independent retail vape shops as
        well as owned and franchised Vapor Shark branded retail locations. TPB
        and Vapor Shark have agreed to explore ways to work together to
        provide best-in-class service to the wholesale vapor channel.
      

Management Observations on the First Quarter
Smokeless Products Segment (30% of total net sales)

      Smokeless products net sales for the first quarter increased 10.4% to
      $20.2 million on the continuing growth of Stoker's MST. Despite an
      increasingly competitive environment, Stoker's MST cases shipped in the
      quarter rose about 9%. Smokeless products volume comparisons to the
      prior year were favorably impacted by one additional shipping day for
      the 2017 period, partially offset by the impact of the Pennsylvania
      excise tax increase (see excise tax discussion below) and by an increase
      in returned goods relative to the low volume of returns incurred during
      the new product introductory period a year-ago. For the quarter, volume
      increased 4.6% and price/mix increased 5.8%.
    

      Year-over-year industry volumes for chewing tobacco declined by
      approximately 5%in the quarter while MST was down approximately
      1%, according to MSAi. (TPB measures industry MST volumes excluding
      pouch and snus products.) TPB outpaced the industry in the quarter and
      grew its MSAi share in both chewing tobacco and MST.
    

      Gross profit for the Smokeless segment increased 0.5%, to $9.3 million.
      Segment gross margin contracted to 45.7% primarily from a LIFO expense
      of $1.1 million in the quarter and continuing growth of Stoker's MST,
      which carries a lower gross margin than chewing tobacco products. Absent
      LIFO expense in both years, gross profit increased 7.8% to $10.4 million
      and gross margin was 51.3%. (See Schedule B for a reconciliation).
    

      "We have established a strong foundation of Stoker's MST distribution in
      independent retailers and are now focused on generating consumer trial
      in those store sets, while also accelerating our penetration in the
      chain store universe," said Wexler. "We are also on schedule to expand
      retail distribution of the regional Wind River smokeless brands in late
      2017."
    

      The MST industry increased pricing in late April 2017. The increase
      ranged between 2.2% and 3.1% on 1.2oz cans. Large format tub pricing was
      more moderate and in the 2.0% range.
    
Smoking Products Segment (41% of total net sales)

      Net sales of Smoking products decreased $0.7 million for the quarter to
      $27.2 million. Net sales in the Smoking segment were unfavorably
      impacted by the previously communicated year-end 2016 trade inventory
      buildup on cigarette papers, which was in line with our expectations,
      and an initial trade inventory impact associated with the April 1, 2017California tax on MYO cigar wraps (see excise tax discussion below).
      Zig-Zag ‘Rillo cigar wraps continued to produce robust sales gains
      associated with expanded retail distribution. For the quarter, Smoking
      products volumes decreased 3.9%, while price/mix increased 1.4%.
    

      Industry volumes for cigarette papers declined by mid-single-digits
      while MYO cigar wraps grew by low double-digits, according to MSAi.
      Zig-Zag increased its market share versus the year-ago period in
      cigarette papers and held an 81% share in MYO cigar wraps, according to
      MSAi.
    

      Smoking products gross profit for the quarter decreased by $0.6 million
      to $13.7 million. Gross margin decreased to 50.4% of net sales compared
      with 51.3% for the year-ago quarter of 2016.
    
NewGen (New Generation) Products Segment (29% of total net sales)
NewGen products net sales for the quarter grew $15.7 million to a record
      $19.4 million, as a result of the inclusion of a full quarter of
      VaporBeast's net sales. In the first quarter, volume increased 420%
      while price/mix accounted for an increase of 11%.
    

      Gross profit for the NewGen segment increased for the quarter versus
      year-ago by $3.6 million to a record $4.7 million. Gross margin weakened
      versus a year-ago from 31.0% to 24.3% of net sales for the current
      period as a result of the mix impact of VaporBeast's lower distributor
      margins on the segment.
    

      "The VaporBeast integration is proceeding and results are progressing at
      better than anticipated levels," said Wexler. "Through our November 2016
      acquisition of VaporBeast, we now have ready access to the
      non-traditional retail outlets they serve and sharply enhanced insights
      into the product forms and attributes consumers are choosing.
      Operational improvements are being made across the business and we are
      pleased with the early progress and are readying plans to more fully
      leverage the VaporBeast platform late this year."
    

      Wexler continued, "While our strategic partnership with Vapor Shark is
      still in the formative stages, we are jointly exploring a number of
      opportunities to collaborate and capture a larger share of the markets
      and channels we collectively serve. We expect to provide more details
      next quarter."
    
Other Performance Measures

      Total company net sales growth of 33.9% was driven by volume gains of
      30.1% with price/mix contributing another 3.8%.
    

      Consolidated selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for
      the quarter were $16.9 million compared to $13.7 million in 2016 due
      primarily to the inclusion of a full quarter of VaporBeast's SG&A,
      strategic expenses, and sales and marketing infrastructure investments.
    

      For the first quarter of 2017 SG&A:
    


        Strategic expenses were $0.3 million versus $0.4 million a year earlier
      

        Non-recurring new product launch costs of $0.5 million were $0.3
        million higher than year-ago
      

        Recurring public company costs were $0.2 million


      Non-recurring launch costs in cost of goods sold in the 2017 first
      quarter were $0.1 million compared to $0.2 million in the first quarter
      a year-ago.
    

      Interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $4.9 million,
      which is $3.5 million, or 42%, lower than the year-ago period. This
      decrease is principally attributable to lower average debt levels since
      our initial public offering coupled with the February 2017 refinancing
      of our debt.
    

      Investment income from our Master Settlement Agreement escrow monies
      amounted to $0.1 million in the quarter.
    

      For the quarter ended March 31, 2017 diluted earnings per share was
      $0.10 and included an after-tax non-recurring non-cash charge on
      extinguishment of debt of $0.19 per diluted share.
    

      Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $0.4 million.
    

      Total debt at March 31, 2017 was $227.4 million. Net debt at March 31,
      2017 was $225.2 million, compared to $215.3 million as of December 31,
      2016, an increase of $9.9 million. Net debt at March 31, 2017 to rolling
      twelve month Adjusted EBITDA was 4.2x (see Schedule C for a
      reconciliation). Net debt at March 31, 2017 to pro forma acquisition
      EBITDA was 3.8x (See Schedule D for a reconciliation).
    

      At March 31, 2017, there were 18.8 million common shares outstanding.
      Weighted average fully diluted shares for the three months ended March
      31, 2017 were 19.6 million.
    
Impact of Excise Tax Changes
Pennsylvania implemented a $0.55 per ounce excise tax on smokeless
      products effective October 1, 2016. The impact of the tax increase on
      trade volumes in the quarter was material to both the industry and TPB.
      Industry volume degradation on a sequential basis was in the mid-teens
      for chewing tobacco and high-single digits for MST. TPB outperformed the
      industry in both chewing tobacco and MST in Pennsylvania, as measured by
      MSAi. TPB will continue to monitor the impact this excise tax has on
      consumer behavior.
    
California passed Proposition 56 in November 2016, which included new
      state excise taxes on liquid vapor products and cigar wraps for the
      first time. Effective April 1, 2017 all OTP products became subject to
      the current 27.3% state excise tax. On July 1, 2017 the tax on all OTP
      products will increase to the new equalized rate that the industry
      estimates will be between 62% and 68%. We believe that the new excise
      tax on MYO cigar wraps adversely impacted category sales, as California
      industry sales for the quarter were materially lower versus year-ago.
      California represents about 5% of industry MYO cigar wraps, cigars and
      MST sales and 10% of industry e-cig volumes. These segment percentages
      generally parallel TPB sales percentages. We anticipate that California
      Proposition 56 will affect trade behavior for the next six months and we
      will continue to closely evaluate its impact on consumer behavior.

      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the
      meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements may
      generally be identified by the use of words such as "anticipate,"
      "believe," "expect," "intend," "plan" and "will" or, in each case, their
      negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. These
      forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical
      facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and
      uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances
      that may or may not occur in the future. As a result, actual events may
      differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the
      forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by TPB in
      this press release speaks only as of the date hereof. New risks and
      uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible for TPB to
      predict these events or how they may affect it. TPB has no obligation,
      and does not intend, to update any forward-looking statements after the
      date hereof, except as required by federal securities laws. Factors that
      could cause these differences include, but are not limited to:
    


        declining sales of tobacco products, and expected continuing decline
        of sales, in the tobacco industry overall;
      

        our dependence on a small number of third-party suppliers and
        producers;
      

        the possibility that we will be unable to identify or contract with
        new suppliers or producers in the event of a supply or product
        disruption;
      

        the possibility that our licenses to use certain brands or trademarks
        will be terminated, challenged or restricted;
      

        failure to maintain consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our
        customers;
      

        substantial and increasing U.S. regulation;
      

        regulation of our products by the FDA, which has broad regulatory
        powers;
      

        uncertainty related to the regulation and taxation of our NewGen
        products;
      

        possible significant increases in federal, state and local municipal
        tobacco-related taxes;
      

        possible significant increases in tobacco-related taxes;
      

        possible increasing international control and regulation;
      

        our reliance on relationships with several large retailers and
        national chains for distribution of our products;
      

        intense competition and our ability to compete effectively;
      

        significant potential product liability litigation;
      

        the scientific community's lack of information regarding the long-term
        health effects of electronic cigarettes, vaporizer and e-liquid use;
      

        our amount of indebtedness;
      

        the terms of our credit facilities, which may restrict our current and
        future operations;
      

        competition from illicit sources;
      

        our reliance on information technology;
      

        security and privacy breaches;
      

        contamination of our tobacco supply or products;
      

        infringement on our intellectual property;
      

        third-party claims that we infringe on their intellectual property;
      

        concentration of business with large customers;
      

        failure to manage our growth;
      

        failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions or otherwise be
        unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions;
      

        failure to achieve expected benefits of the VaporBeast acquisition and
        to integrate VaporBeast's operations with ours;
      

        fluctuations in our results;
      

        exchange rate fluctuations;
      

        adverse U.S. and global economic conditions;
      

        failure to comply with certain regulations;
      

        departure of key management personnel or our inability to attract and
        retain talent;
      

        decrease in value of our deferred tax assets;
      

        imposition of significant tariffs on imports into the U.S.;
      

        reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth
        companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors,
        potentially decreasing our stock price;
      

        failure to maintain our status as an emerging growth company before
        the five-year maximum time period a company may retain such status;
      

        our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence
        over matters submitted to our stockholders and may take certain
        actions to prevent takeovers;
      

        our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law
        and certain regulations, could discourage or prohibit acquisition bids
        or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of
        our common stock;
      

        our certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of our common
        stock by individuals and entities that are Restricted Investors. These
        restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may
        result in Restricted Investors being required to sell or redeem their
        shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution
        rights;
      

        future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our
        stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale
        of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us;
        and
      

        we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the
        voting power or value of our common stock.

      Schedule A
    

      To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S.
      GAAP, we use non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA,
      Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Gross Profit excluding LIFO. We believe
      Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors
      regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our
      financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt
      and Gross Profit excluding LIFO are used by management to compare our
      performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning
      purposes and is presented to our board of directors. We believe that
      EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Profit excluding LIFO are appropriate
      measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of
      expenses that do not relate to business performance.
    

      We define "EBITDA" as net income before interest expense, loss on
      extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation and
      amortization. We define "Adjusted EBITDA" as net income before interest
      expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes,
      depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items and other items that we
      do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating
      performance. We define "Net Debt" as total debt less cash. We define
      "Gross Profit excluding LIFO" as gross profit less LIFO charges.
    

      Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or
      superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
      Adjusted EBITDA excludes significant expenses that are required by U.S.
      GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to
      inherent limitations. In addition, other companies in our industry may
      calculate this non-U.S. GAAP measure differently than we do or may not
      calculate it at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
      The table below provides a reconciliation between net income and
      Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31,
      2016.

Turning Point Brands, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Results






May 11, 2017 06:50 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Turning Point Brands, Inc. (NYSE: TPB), a leading provider of Other 
      Tobacco Products (“OTP”) today announced financial results for the first 
      quarter ended March 31, 2017.
    


      “Today marks the one-year anniversary of our initial public offering and 
      listing on the NYSE,” said TPB President and Chief Executive Officer, 
      Larry Wexler. “Over the course of the last twelve months, we have 
      produced strong operating results and improved our cash flow, completed 
      two acquisitions and refinanced our debt. We expect to continue to 
      generate organic growth from our focus brands, Zig-Zag, Stoker’s, and 
      VaporBeast. We plan to use our strong cash flow to further strengthen 
      our brands, reduce our debt and fund acquisitions. We believe that we 
      are increasingly well-positioned to continue to grow the business and 
      improve our operating performance.”
    

First Quarter 2017 Results at a Glance


      (Comparisons vs. first quarter 2016)
    


        Net sales increased 33.9% to a record $66.8 million
      

        Gross profit increased 12.2% to a record $27.7 million
      

        Non-recurring non-cash charge on extinguishment of debt associated 
        with refinancing incurred in the first quarter of $6.1 million
      

        Net income of $1.9 million
      

        Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.5% to $13.6 million (see Schedule A for a

Recent Events:



        TPB entered into a strategic partnership with Vapor Shark, a leading 
        distributor and manufacturer of premium vaping e-liquids and hardware, 
        with nationwide distribution through independent retail vape shops as 
        well as owned and franchised Vapor Shark branded retail locations. TPB 
        and Vapor Shark have agreed to explore ways to work together to 
        provide best-in-class service to the wholesale vapor channel.
      


Management Observations on the First Quarter


Smokeless Products Segment (30% of total net sales)


      Smokeless products net sales for the first quarter increased 10.4% to 
      $20.2 million on the continuing growth of Stoker’s MST. Despite an 
      increasingly competitive environment, Stoker’s MST cases shipped in the 
      quarter rose about 9%. Smokeless products volume comparisons to the 
      prior year were favorably impacted by one additional shipping day for 
      the 2017 period, partially offset by the impact of the Pennsylvania 
      excise tax increase (see excise tax discussion below) and by an increase 
      in returned goods relative to the low volume of returns incurred during 
      the new product introductory period a year-ago. For the quarter, volume 
      increased 4.6% and price/mix increased 5.8%.
    

      Year-over-year industry volumes for chewing tobacco declined by 
      approximately 5% in the quarter while MST was down approximately 
      1%, according to MSAi. (TPB measures industry MST volumes excluding 
      pouch and snus products.) TPB outpaced the industry in the quarter and 
      grew its MSAi share in both chewing tobacco and MST.
    

      Gross profit for the Smokeless segment increased 0.5%, to $9.3 million. 
      Segment gross margin contracted to 45.7% primarily from a LIFO expense 
      of $1.1 million in the quarter and continuing growth of Stoker’s MST, 
      which carries a lower gross margin than chewing tobacco products. Absent 
      LIFO expense in both years, gross profit increased 7.8% to $10.4 million 
      and gross margin was 51.3%. (See Schedule B for a reconciliation).
    

      “We have established a strong foundation of Stoker’s MST distribution in 
      independent retailers and are now focused on generating consumer trial 
      in those store sets, while also accelerating our penetration in the 
      chain store universe,” said Wexler. “We are also on schedule to expand 
      retail distribution of the regional Wind River smokeless brands in late 
      2017.”
    

      The MST industry increased pricing in late April 2017. The increase 
      ranged between 2.2% and 3.1% on 1.2oz cans. Large format tub pricing was 
      more moderate and in the 2.0% range.
    

Smoking Products Segment (41% of total net sales)


      Net sales of Smoking products decreased $0.7 million for the quarter to 
      $27.2 million. Net sales in the Smoking segment were unfavorably 
      impacted by the previously communicated year-end 2016 trade inventory 
      buildup on cigarette papers, which was in line with our expectations, 
      and an initial trade inventory impact associated with the April 1, 2017 
      California tax on MYO cigar wraps (see excise tax discussion below). 
      Zig-Zag ‘Rillo cigar wraps continued to produce robust sales gains 
      associated with expanded retail distribution. For the quarter, Smoking 
      products volumes decreased 3.9%, while price/mix increased 1.4%.
    

      Industry volumes for cigarette papers declined by mid-single-digits 
      while MYO cigar wraps grew by low double-digits, according to MSAi. 
      Zig-Zag increased its market share versus the year-ago period in 
      cigarette papers and held an 81% share in MYO cigar wraps, according to 
      MSAi.
    

      Smoking products gross profit for the quarter decreased by $0.6 million 
      to $13.7 million. Gross margin decreased to 50.4% of net sales compared 
      with 51.3% for the year-ago quarter of 2016.
    

NewGen (New Generation) Products Segment (29% of total net sales)


      NewGen products net sales for the quarter grew $15.7 million to a record 
      $19.4 million, as a result of the inclusion of a full quarter of 
      VaporBeast’s net sales. In the first quarter, volume increased 420% 
      while price/mix accounted for an increase of 11%.
    

      Gross profit for the NewGen segment increased for the quarter versus 
      year-ago by $3.6 million to a record $4.7 million. Gross margin weakened 
      versus a year-ago from 31.0% to 24.3% of net sales for the current 
      period as a result of the mix impact of VaporBeast’s lower distributor 
      margins on the segment.
    

      “The VaporBeast integration is proceeding and results are progressing at 
      better than anticipated levels,” said Wexler. “Through our November 2016 
      acquisition of VaporBeast, we now have ready access to the 
      non-traditional retail outlets they serve and sharply enhanced insights 
      into the product forms and attributes consumers are choosing. 
      Operational improvements are being made across the business and we are 
      pleased with the early progress and are readying plans to more fully 
      leverage the VaporBeast platform late this year.”
    

      Wexler continued, “While our strategic partnership with Vapor Shark is 
      still in the formative stages, we are jointly exploring a number of 
      opportunities to collaborate and capture a larger share of the markets 
      and channels we collectively serve. We expect to provide more details 
      next quarter.”
    

Other Performance Measures


      Total company net sales growth of 33.9% was driven by volume gains of 
      30.1% with price/mix contributing another 3.8%.
    

      Consolidated selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for 
      the quarter were $16.9 million compared to $13.7 million in 2016 due 
      primarily to the inclusion of a full quarter of VaporBeast’s SG&A, 
      strategic expenses, and sales and marketing infrastructure investments.
    

      For the first quarter of 2017 SG&A:
    


        Strategic expenses were $0.3 million versus $0.4 million a year earlier
      

        Non-recurring new product launch costs of $0.5 million were $0.3 
        million higher than year-ago
      

        Recurring public company costs were $0.2 million
      


      Non-recurring launch costs in cost of goods sold in the 2017 first 
      quarter were $0.1 million compared to $0.2 million in the first quarter 
      a year-ago.
    

      Interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $4.9 million, 
      which is $3.5 million, or 42%, lower than the year-ago period. This 
      decrease is principally attributable to lower average debt levels since 
      our initial public offering coupled with the February 2017 refinancing 
      of our debt.
    

      Investment income from our Master Settlement Agreement escrow monies 
      amounted to $0.1 million in the quarter.
    

      For the quarter ended March 31, 2017 diluted earnings per share was 
      $0.10 and included an after-tax non-recurring non-cash charge on 
      extinguishment of debt of $0.19 per diluted share.
    

      Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $0.4 million.
    

      Total debt at March 31, 2017 was $227.4 million. Net debt at March 31, 
      2017 was $225.2 million, compared to $215.3 million as of December 31, 
      2016, an increase of $9.9 million. Net debt at March 31, 2017 to rolling 
      twelve month Adjusted EBITDA was 4.2x (see Schedule C for a 
      reconciliation). Net debt at March 31, 2017 to pro forma acquisition 
      EBITDA was 3.8x (See Schedule D for a reconciliation).
    

      At March 31, 2017, there were 18.8 million common shares outstanding. 
      Weighted average fully diluted shares for the three months ended March 
      31, 2017 were 19.6 million.
    

Impact of Excise Tax Changes


      Pennsylvania implemented a $0.55 per ounce excise tax on smokeless 
      products effective October 1, 2016. The impact of the tax increase on 
      trade volumes in the quarter was material to both the industry and TPB. 
      Industry volume degradation on a sequential basis was in the mid-teens 
      for chewing tobacco and high-single digits for MST. TPB outperformed the 
      industry in both chewing tobacco and MST in Pennsylvania, as measured by 
      MSAi. TPB will continue to monitor the impact this excise tax has on 
      consumer behavior.
    

      California passed Proposition 56 in November 2016, which included new 
      state excise taxes on liquid vapor products and cigar wraps for the 
      first time. Effective April 1, 2017 all OTP products became subject to 
      the current 27.3% state excise tax. On July 1, 2017 the tax on all OTP 
      products will increase to the new equalized rate that the industry 
      estimates will be between 62% and 68%. We believe that the new excise 
      tax on MYO cigar wraps adversely impacted category sales, as California 
      industry sales for the quarter were materially lower versus year-ago. 
      California represents about 5% of industry MYO cigar wraps, cigars and 
      MST sales and 10% of industry e-cig volumes. These segment percentages 
      generally parallel TPB sales percentages. We anticipate that California 
      Proposition 56 will affect trade behavior for the next six months and we 
      will continue to closely evaluate its impact on consumer behavior.

        declining sales of tobacco products, and expected continuing decline 
        of sales, in the tobacco industry overall;
      

        our dependence on a small number of third-party suppliers and 
        producers;
      

        the possibility that we will be unable to identify or contract with 
        new suppliers or producers in the event of a supply or product 
        disruption;
      

        the possibility that our licenses to use certain brands or trademarks 
        will be terminated, challenged or restricted;
      

        failure to maintain consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our 
        customers;
      

        substantial and increasing U.S. regulation;
      

        regulation of our products by the FDA, which has broad regulatory 
        powers;
      

        uncertainty related to the regulation and taxation of our NewGen 
        products;
      

        possible significant increases in federal, state and local municipal 
        tobacco-related taxes;
      

        possible significant increases in tobacco-related taxes;
      

        possible increasing international control and regulation;
      

        our reliance on relationships with several large retailers and 
        national chains for distribution of our products;
      

        intense competition and our ability to compete effectively;
      

        significant potential product liability litigation;
      

        the scientific community’s lack of information regarding the long-term 
        health effects of electronic cigarettes, vaporizer and e-liquid use;
      

        our amount of indebtedness;
      

        the terms of our credit facilities, which may restrict our current and 
        future operations;
      

        competition from illicit sources;
      

        our reliance on information technology;
      

        security and privacy breaches;
      

        contamination of our tobacco supply or products;
      

        infringement on our intellectual property;
      

        third-party claims that we infringe on their intellectual property;
      

        concentration of business with large customers;
      

        failure to manage our growth;
      

        failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions or otherwise be 
        unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions;
      

        failure to achieve expected benefits of the VaporBeast acquisition and 
        to integrate VaporBeast’s operations with ours;
      

        fluctuations in our results;
      

        exchange rate fluctuations;
      

        adverse U.S. and global economic conditions;
      

        failure to comply with certain regulations;
      

        departure of key management personnel or our inability to attract and 
        retain talent;
      

        decrease in value of our deferred tax assets;
      

        imposition of significant tariffs on imports into the U.S.;
      

        reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth 
        companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors, 
        potentially decreasing our stock price;
      

        failure to maintain our status as an emerging growth company before 
        the five-year maximum time period a company may retain such status;
      

        our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence 
        over matters submitted to our stockholders and may take certain 
        actions to prevent takeovers;
      

        our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law 
        and certain regulations, could discourage or prohibit acquisition bids 
        or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of 
        our common stock;
      

        our certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of our common 
        stock by individuals and entities that are Restricted Investors. These 
        restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may 
        result in Restricted Investors being required to sell or redeem their 
        shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution 
        rights;
      

        future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our 
        stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale 
        of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us; 
        and
      

        we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the 
        voting power or value of our common stock.

      To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with

      and Gross Profit excluding LIFO are used by management to compare our 
      performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning 
      purposes and is presented to our board of directors. We believe that 
      EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Profit excluding LIFO are appropriate 
      measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of 
      expenses that do not relate to business performance.
    

      We define “EBITDA” as net income before interest expense, loss on 
      extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation and 
      amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income before interest 
      expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, 
      depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items and other items that we 
      do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating 
      performance. We define “Net Debt” as total debt less cash. We define 
      “Gross Profit excluding LIFO” as gross profit less LIFO charges.
    

      Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or 
      superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
      Adjusted EBITDA excludes significant expenses that are required by U.S. 
      GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to 
      inherent limitations. In addition, other companies in our industry may 
      calculate this non-U.S. GAAP measure differently than we do or may not 
      calculate it at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
      The table below provides a reconciliation between net income and 
      Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 
      2016.
