Our Story
Our History










Going strong for over 150 years
From the start, Pentair has been a company driven by vision, while grounded in the practical application of the best available ideas. Many of our acquired businesses and their products have a rich history that dates back more than 150 years. Stemmed in innovation, these organizations have designed and engineered some of the most important flow management and heat solution products in the industry. 
Spanning the globe and dating as far back as 1859, these product lines have been an integral part of the industrialization of many countries, helping to engineer industry operations in energy and processing - as well as establishing important infrastructure in the construction of power plants and water pipelines. 
We are a company comprising innovators and entrepreneurs. From the first self-regulated heat cable (Raychem) to the first variable speed pool pump, we hold a number of patents for products essential to today's industries. 








Our History











1966: THE FOUNDING FIVE
August 31, 1966, Murray Harpole, Vern Stone, Vincent Follmer, Leroy Nelson and Gary Ostrand founded Pentair Industries, Inc. The founders based the name of the company on the Greek root penta-, a reference to the five founding partners. 













1966: FIRST PUBLIC OFFERING
The first public offering of Pentair shares occurred on December 6, 1966. Fidelity Bank served as registrar and transfer agent. 













1968-1978: THE PAPER-LED YEARS
With the purchase of Peavey Paper Mills, Pentair entered the paper industry on June 3, 1968. While driving Pentair's growth in the paper industry throughout the 1970's, the management team also focused on examining other avenues for growth and began to diversify the business portfolio into industrial products in 1978. 













1981-2004: THE TOOLS-LED YEARS
In 1981, Pentair made its first major investment in a non-paper business, acquiring Porter-Cable, a manufacturer of portable electric power tools. 













1990's: THE ADDITION OF ENCLOSURES
Pentair's first foray into the enclosures industry began in 1988 with the acquisition of Hoffman Engineering Company. In 1994 and 1997 respectively, Pentair entered European markets through the acquisitions of Schroff and Transrack, manufacturers of electronic enclosures. 













2001: STRONG & STEADY LEADERSHIP
Pentair gets its 4th CEO, Randall J. Hogan. Randall Hogan is the 4th CEO in 45 years, after Murray J. Harpole, Gene Nugentand Winslow Buxton respectively. Coincidentally, all four CEOs have been left handed. 













2004: TOOLS EXIT...WATER EXPANSION
Looking ahead to the future, the team closely examined opportunities for stronger growth and higher shareholder returns. In 2004, Pentair divested of its tools business and plunged into the water industry with the purchase of Wicor Industries. 













2005-2012: PIMS AND GLOBAL EXPANSION
Pentair advances its Pentair Integrated Management System (PIMS) by expanding lean enterprise and introducing standard work around talent management and growth. Pentair strengthened its global presence in fast growing regions, including China, Latin America, and the Middle East.













2012: 36th year of increased dividends
Pentair returned approximately $80 million to shareholders through dividends and raised its quarterly dividend for the 36th consecutive year for 2012, up 10 percent. 













2012: BETTER TOGETHER
Building on the achievements of Pentair and Tyco Flow Control’s Valves & Controls, Thermal Controls, and Water & Environmental Systems businesses, the new Pentair delivers exceptional depth and expertise in filtration and processing, flow management, equipment protection, and thermal management.













PENTAIR TODAY
Today, Pentair is is a global company dedicated to building a safer, more sustainable world. Pentair delivers industry leading products, services and solutions that help people make the best use of the resources they rely on most. Around the globe, our 19,000 Pentair employees apply fresh insights, a collaborative working style and rigorous approaches to create healthier, safer environments for all.
