Title: 
               Company: Trinity Hall Chapel
Job Details
               Every year Trinity Hall, like all Cambridge colleges, makes a submission called the Education Memorandum to the Government's higher education funding agency (HEFCE) to account for the monies the College receives for undergraduate teaching from that source. The object is simple: to prove that all funds provided have been used properly for their intended purpose - education. This is alarmingly simple to do. In real terms, the amounts we receive have been falling for over a decade, during the same period the number of students admitted has risen inexorably. The Government's stated aim is to get 50% of the population of the qualifying age into Higher Education - last year it managed 46%! The effect of this at Trinity Hall, is, that after receipt of the combined Government/parental fee contribution to tuition fees, the College is left with a shortfall of approximately £5,000 for every undergraduate admitted. This gap has to be bridged from investment, rental, and interest income derived from the professional financial management of our endowment. In order to maintain a world-leading academic Fellowship, its supervision-based style of teaching which is the envy of every university outside Oxbridge, and outstanding facilities, accommodation and catering, all of which constitute the unique Cambridge experience, the College's limited resources are under relentless pressure.
