Srb Corporation Company Profile

   Listen here, pilgrim: If you're motoring around New England, Plymouth Rock Assurance has got you covered. Plymouth Rock Assurance sells auto insurance through a network of more than 400 independent agents in Massachusetts and Connecticut. It was the first insurance firm to offer a door-to-door program (in which it makes arrangements for the towing and repair of damaged vehicles for its policyholders). Plymouth Rock Assurance partners with a group of pre-selected body shops to send business their way; in return, the shops give priority to repairs for Plymouth customers. The company is the flagship of The Plymouth Rock Group, which writes and manages automobile and homeowners insurance throughout the Northeast.

Srb Corporation Revenue and Financial Data

   Listen here, pilgrim: If you're motoring around New England, Plymouth Rock Assurance has got you covered. Plymouth Rock Assurance sells auto insurance through a network of more than 400 independent agents in Massachusetts and Connecticut. It was the first insurance firm to offer a door-to-door program (in which it makes arrangements for the towing and repair of damaged vehicles for its policyholders). Plymouth Rock Assurance partners with a group of pre-selected body shops to send business their way; in return, the shops give priority to repairs for Plymouth customers. The company is the flagship of The Plymouth Rock Group, which writes and manages automobile and homeowners insurance throughout the Northeast.
