 FIRST REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST OF NEW JERSEY (OTCMKTS:FREVS) Files An 8-K Other EventsItem 8.01 Other Events Wayne PSC, LLC (“Wayne PSC”), a 40% owned affiliate of First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey (“FREIT”), owns and operates the Preakness Shopping Center in Wayne, New Jersey. Macy’s operated an 81,160 square foot store in the shopping center under a long-term lease and was paying annual rent of $234,000 (approximately $2.88 per square foot) with no future rent escalations for the remaining term of the lease and any renewal periods. On April 25, 2017, Wayne PSC announced it had agreed to a termination of Macy’s lease effective as of April 15, 2017. To terminate the lease and take possession of the space, Wayne PSC paid Macy’s a termination fee of $620,000. Wayne PSC expects to re-position this space and re-lease to a new tenant (or multiple tenants) at market rents, which are currently higher than the rent provided for under the terminated Macy’s lease. FREIT’s operating results will be adversely affected as a result of the vacancy until such time as the space is fully re-leased. FREIT anticipates increased revenue from the space when it is fully re-leased. The statements in this report that relate to future earnings or performance are forward-looking. Actual results might differ materially and be adversely affected by such factors as longer than anticipated lease-up periods or the inability of tenants to pay increased rents. Additional information about these factors is contained in the Trust’s filings with the SEC including the Trust’s most recently filed reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.   About FIRST REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST OF NEW JERSEY (OTCMKTS:FREVS) First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey is an equity real estate investment trust (REIT).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Cautionary Statement Identifying Important Factors That Could Cause FREIT's Actual Results to Differ From Those Projected in Forward Looking Statements. Readers of this discussion are advised that the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of FREIT (including related notes thereto) appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this discussion may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect FREIT's current expectations regarding future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and achievements of FREIT, and do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. FREIT has tried, wherever possible, to identify these forward-looking statements by using words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend, " "plan," " estimate," or words of similar meaning.  OVERVIEW  FREIT is an equity real estate investment trust ("REIT") that is self-administered and externally managed. FREIT owns a portfolio of residential apartment and commercial properties. Our revenues consist primarily of fixed rental income from our residential and commercial properties and additional rent in the form of expense reimbursements derived from our income producing commercial properties. Our properties are primarily located in northern New Jersey and Maryland. We acquire existing properties for investment. We also acquire properties, that we feel have redevelopment potential, and we make changes and capital improvements to these properties. We develop and construct properties on our vacant land. Our policy is to acquire and develop real property for long-term investment.  The economic and financial environment:The recovery in the U.S. has finally gained traction: (a) the housing market continues to improve; (b) inflation is expected to remain in check; (c) consumer spending is increasing modestly; (d) private sector employment is growing steadily; and (e) credit availability has improved. These factors should continue to aid economic growth in the United States.  Residential Properties: We have aggressively increased rental rates. As a result, our rental rates continue to show year-over-year increases. However, this practice has increased the vacancies in some of our residential properties in the short-term. We expect this aggressive rental rate policy will more than offset short-term rental revenue losses resulting from increased vacancies. We expect increases in rental rates to taper; however, the increased rental rates that are in place should positively impact future revenues.  Commercial Properties: The retail outlook has shown improvement because of increases in consumer spending over the past year and this improvement is expected to continue over the next couple of years.  Development Projects and Capital Expenditures: We continue to make only those capital expenditures that are absolutely necessary. As of November 2011, the expansion and renovation of the Damascus Center was completed. On July 24, 2012, the FREIT Board of Trustees approved revisions to the scope of the Rotunda redevelopment project, thereby reducing the complexity and projected cost of the project. In order to avoid beginning construction during the winter months, Rotunda began construction on the parking lot areas in September 2013.  Debt Financing Availability:Financing for development projects has become more available. As a result, on December 9, 2013, Grande Rotunda, LLC closed with Wells Fargo Bank on a construction loan of up to $120 million to be used for the purpose of funding the major redevelopment and expansion project planned for the Rotunda.  Operating Cash Flow and Dividend Distributions: We expect that cash provided by net operating income will be adequate to cover mandatory debt service payments (excluding balloon payments), necessary capital improvements and dividends necessary to retain qualification as a REIT (90% of taxable income). Until the economic climate indicates that a change is appropriate, it is FREIT's intention to maintain its quarterly dividend at a level not less than that required to maintain its REIT status for Federal income tax purposes.  Table of Contents  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Pursuant to the SEC disclosure guidance for "Critical Accounting Policies," the SEC defines Critical Accounting Policies as those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, the preparation of which takes into account estimates based on judgments and assumptions that affect certain amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. The accounting policies and estimates used, which are outlined in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements which is presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K, have been applied consistently as at October 31, 2013 and October 31, 2012, and for the years ended October 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. We believe that the following accounting policies or estimates require the application of management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments:  Revenue Recognition: Base rents, additional rents based on tenants' sales volume and reimbursement of the tenants' share of certain operating expenses are generally recognized when due from tenants. The straight-line basis is used to recognize base rents under leases if they provide for varying rents over the lease terms. Straight-line rents represent unbilled rents receivable to the extent straight-line rents exceed current rents billed in accordance with lease agreements. Before FREIT can recognize revenue, it is required to assess, among other things, its collectibility.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets: We periodically assess the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever we determine that events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. When FREIT determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may be impaired, the measurement of any impairment is based on a projected discounted cash flow method determined by FREIT's management. While we believe that our discounted cash flow methods are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows may significantly affect the measurement of impairment.  Real Estate Development Costs: It is FREIT's policy to capitalize pre-development costs, which generally include legal and professional fees and other directly related third-party costs. Real estate taxes and interest costs incurred during the development and construction phases are also capitalized. FREIT ceases capitalization of these costs when the project or portion thereof becomes operational, or when construction has been postponed. Capitalization of these costs will recommence once construction on the project resumes.  Adopted and recently issued accounting standards:  In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-10, "Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Derecognition of in Substance Real Estate-a Scope Clarification". The purpose of this update is to resolve the diversity in practice about whether the guidance under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 360-20, "Property, Plant, and Equipment-Real Estate Sales", applies to a parent that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary, as specified under ASC Subtopic 810-10, "Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51", that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary's nonrecourse debt. The new guidance is intended to emphasize that accounting for such transactions "is based on their substance rather than their form", specifically that the parent should only deconsolidate the real estate subsidiary when legal title to the real estate is transferred to the lender and the related nonrecourse debt has been extinguished. The standard takes effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years beginning on or after June 15, 2012. The adoption of this guidance in the year ended October 31, 2013 did not have any impact on our financial statements.  In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, "Presentation of Comprehensive Income", which supersedes the presentation options in ASC Topic 220, "Reporting of Comprehensive Income". The new standard provides guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. The new guidance only affects the presentation of comprehensive income, and not the components that must be reported therein. The standard takes effect for public companies effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted this standard on November 1, 2012 and elected to present a separate Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.  In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. This update stated that the specific requirement in ASU 2011-05 to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income will be deferred. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This update requires companies to present the effects on the line items of net income of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the amount being reclassified is required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to be reclassified in its entirety to net income in the same reporting period. ASU 2013-02 is effective prospectively for the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012 with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet adopted this guidance, and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations:  Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2013 and 2012 Summary revenues and net income for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2013 ("Fiscal 2013") and October 31, 2012 ("Fiscal 2012") are as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2013 2012 Change (in thousands, except per share amounts) Real estate revenues: Commercial properties $ 22,840 $ 23,398 $ (558 ) Residential properties 18,497 18,680 (183 ) Total real estate revenues 41,337 42,078 (741 ) Operating expenses: Real estate operations 18,127 17,968 159 General and administrative 1,623 1,624 (1 ) Deferred project cost write-off, net of income relating to early lease termination - 776 (776 ) Depreciation 6,233 6,171 62 Total operating expenses 25,983 26,539 (556 ) Operating income 15,354 15,539 (185 ) Investment income 191 173 18 Financing costs (11,945 ) (11,704 ) (241 ) Income from continuing operations 3,600 4,008 (408 ) Income from discontinued operation 797 460 337 Gain on sale of discontinued operation 3,545 7,528 (a) (3,983 ) Net income 7,942 11,996 (4,054 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries (493 ) (645 ) 152 Net income attributable to common equity $ 7,449 $ 11,351 $ (3,902 ) Earnings per share: Continuing operations $ 0.45 $ 0.49 $ (0.04 ) Discontinued operations 0.62 1.15 (0.53 ) Net income attributable to common equity $ 1.07 $ 1.64 $ (0.57 ) Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 6,942 6,942  (a) Represents gain of $9,493 net of federal and state tax of $1,965.  Real estate revenue for Fiscal 2013 decreased 1.8% to $41,337,000, compared to $42,078,000 for Fiscal 2012, exclusive of income of $2,950,000 relating to an early lease termination by Giant.  Net Income attributable to common equity ("net income common equity") for Fiscal 2013 was $7,449,000 ($1.07 per share basic), compared to $11,351,000 ($1.64 per share basic) for Fiscal 2012. Included in net income common equity for Fiscal 2013 were gains from the sale of real estate amounting to $3,545,000. For Fiscal 2012, net income common equity included the net after-tax gain of $7,528,000 related to the sale of real estate. Also included in income from discontinued operations for Fiscal 2013 is a $720,000 income tax credit related to the sale of the Heights Manor property. Additionally, Fiscal 2012 included certain other items that affect comparability, specifically $2,950,000 of income relating to the Giant early lease termination, offset by the related deferred project cost write-off of $3,726,000. Adjusting income from continuing operations for the above mentioned comparability items included therein, adjusted income from continuing operations for Fiscal 2013 was $3,600,000 ($0.52 per share basic), compared to $4,784,000 ($0.69 per share basic) for Fiscal 2012. Adjusted income from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure, which management believes is a useful and meaningful gauge to investors of our operating performance, since it excludes the impact of unusual and infrequent items specifically: the Giant lease termination fee income, and the related project abandonment cost write-off, as well as income applicable to discontinued operations.

Table of Contents  NOI is based on operating revenue and expenses directly associated with the operations of the real estate properties, but excludes deferred rents (straight lining), lease amortization, depreciation, financing costs and other items. FREIT assesses and measures segment operating results based on NOI.  Same Property NOI: FREIT considers same property net operating income ("Same Property NOI") to be a useful supplemental non-GAAP measure of our operating performance. We define same property within both our commercial and residential segments to be those properties that we have owned and operated for both the current and prior periods presented, excluding those properties that we acquired, redeveloped or classified as discontinued operations during those periods. Any newly acquired property that has been in operation for less than a year, any property that is undergoing a major redevelopment, but may still be in operation at less than full capacity, and/or any property that is under contract for sale are not considered same property.  NOI and Same Property NOI are non-GAAP financial measures and are not measures of operating results or cash flow as measured by generally accepted accounting principles, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  COMMERCIAL SEGMENT  The commercial segment contains ten (10) separate properties. Seven are multi-tenanted retail or office centers, and one is a single tenanted store. In addition, FREIT owns land in Rockaway, NJ and Rochelle Park, NJ from which it receives monthly rental income, from tenants who have built and operate bank branches on the land. As indicated in the table above under the caption Segment Information, total revenue and NOI from FREIT's commercial segment for Fiscal 2013 decreased by 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, as compared to Fiscal 2012. The major contributing factors to the overall decline in revenue for Fiscal 2013 were the vacancy resulting from the termination of the Giant lease for 35,994 square feet of space at the Rotunda property in February 2012, and $300,000 in non-recurring easement income recognized by the Franklin Crossing Shopping Center, in Franklin Lakes, NJ during the 4th quarter of Fiscal 2012. It is not anticipated that the Giant space at the Rotunda (or a reconfiguration of this space) will be leased until the redevelopment of the Rotunda is completed. (See discussion below.) The decrease in rental revenue for the current year was slightly offset by a lower level of administrative expenses for Fiscal 2013, primarily due to a higher level of bad debt expense incurred in Fiscal 2012.  Same Property Operating Results: FREIT's commercial segment currently contains ten (10) same properties. (See definition of same property under Segment Information above.) For Fiscal 2013, same property revenue and same property NOI for our commercial segment decreased by 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, as compared to Fiscal 2012.  Leasing: The following table reflects leasing activity at our commercial properties for comparable leases (leases executed for spaces in which there was a tenant at some point during the previous twelve-month period) and non-comparable leases for Fiscal 2013:   Tenant Weighted Weighted Improvement Average Average Prior Allowance Lease Number of Lease Area Lease Rate Lease Rate % Increase (per Sq Ft) Commissions Leases (Sq Ft) (per Sq Ft) (per Sq Ft) (Decrease) (a) (per Sq Ft) (a) Comparable leases 33 107,149 $ 18.70 $ 17.02 9.9% $ 2.52 $ 0.58 Non-comparable leases 9 27,880 $ 19.00 N/A N/A $ 3.31 $ 0.95 Total leasing activity 42 135,029  (a) These leasing costs are presented as annualized costs per square foot and are allocated uniformly over the initial lease term.  The US economic recovery continued to show signs of improvement during 2013, with retail sales also showing slight improvement. Exclusive of the Giant space at the Rotunda (see discussion below); tenant fall-out at our other properties has been minor. Average occupancy rates for Fiscal 2013, exclusive of the Giant space at the Rotunda, decreased 0.8% from last year's comparable period.  Construction related to the expansion and renovation of the Damascus Center was completed in November 2011. We are currently in the negotiation process with potential tenants for the new, currently available space constructed in the final phase (Phase III) of this project. As of October 31, 2013, approximately 86% of the space at the Damascus Center is leased and 76.8% is occupied.  At Westridge Square, Giant elected not to extend its lease beyond October 31, . . .

FIRST REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST OF NEW JERSEY




Since 1961, First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey (FREIT) has been an equity real estate investment trust that takes pride in its investment portfolio. Whether apartment communities, shopping centers and commercial buildings, or mixed-use developments, every project we invest in is for the long-term. This is our focus.

We conduct our operations in compliance with the requirements for qualifying as a real estate investment trust pursuant to the Federal Internal Revenue Code. As a result, we receive favorable tax treatment as provided under the tax code. FREIT has recorded a profit and has paid dividends to its shareholders during each year since its founding.

Our impressive record of performance over the last four decades is a tribute to the outstanding efforts made by Hekemian & Co.,Inc., a real estate management and brokerage company that has managed FREITS™ assets since its inception.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
