Astika Holdings, Inc. Updates Shareholders And Prepares For Growth In The Nantong Region






Business Wire




Jul 25, 2014 10:03 AM EDT













 


















































  Astika Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: ASKH) ( http://nantongventures.com)Astika Holdings is focused on a variety of strategic acquisitions in service, agriculture and industrial companies to compliment and grow Astika Holdings, Inc.'s business. The Company is positioning to capture the next wave of growth companies from Asia. Astika Holdings is focused on the Nantong region of China and is positioning to negotiate with growth companies from the Nantong region. Nantong is known as a "Pearl of the River and Sea," ideally situated near the mouth of the Yangtze river with a rich and diverse history dating back to the Chinese Han Dynasty. Inhabitants first lived in the region 5,000 years ago because of its abundant natural resources and access to the Yangtze river. Nantong has a national reputation of "the First Window on the Yangtze River" and is one of the China's prized national tourist centers. As the centerpiece in the Yangtze Delta Economic Zone, Nantong has enjoyed rapid economic growth and increasing foreign investments. The city is listed on the China's Top 100 Counties (county-level cities) for its strong economy. Nantong is one of China's first fourteen coastal cities open to international trade. Nantong is poised for accelerated economic growth with new bridges over the Yangtze River connecting the Nantong region to the Shanghai metropolitan region. With the development of the Rudong Yangkou Harbor Nantong offers the only natural deep water harbor in central China's coast with access to China's largest markets. Nantong's rich history of economic prosperity and growth converge with national modernization continue to make Nantong a major center for economic development in China. Astika Holdings intends to be a high growth company focused on adding value through successful project development, efficient operations, and opportunistic acquisitions while maintaining a low risk profile through project diversification, astute financial management and operating in secure jurisdictions.   Forward-Looking Statements - This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such Forward Looking Statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact in this announcement are forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the viability of the company's business plans, the effect of acquisitions on our profitability, the effectiveness, profitability, and the marketability of the Company's products; the Company's ability to protect its proprietary information; general economic and business conditions; the volatility of the company's operating results and financial condition; and other risks detailed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Astika Holdings, Inc. to Expand Its Agriculture Acquisitions into the Industrial Hemp Sector | Business Wire


























































Astika Holdings, Inc. to Expand Its Agriculture Acquisitions into the 
      Industrial Hemp Sector






March 17, 2014 06:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



AUCKLAND, New Zealand--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Astika Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") (OTCQB: ASKH) a strategic 
      acquisition company of service, agriculture and industrial companies 
      from the Nantong Region in China announced today that it is entering 
      into the Industrial Hemp sector through partnerships with current 
      leaseholders with the goal of acquiring operating facilities to begin 
      its own facilities in Asia and New Zealand. Astika further announces the 
      launch of Nantong HZ Hemp Co. Ltd which shall be utilized for Industrial 
      Hemp and related projects. Astika’s entrance into the Industrial Hemp 
      sector is in conjunction with Astika's commitment to acquisitions and 
      development of agriculture in Asia and New Zealand.
    


      Mark Richards, the director for Astika Holdings stated, “Global demand 
      for hemp is increasing. The Company’s existing relationships with China 
      coupled with New Zealand infrastructure for seed production and food 
      processing along with New Zealand’s temperate climate and ideal soils 
      offers Astika a position to capture the added value and economic 
      benefits that this opportunity presents. We are rapidly adding to 
      Astika’s plans in agriculture by focusing our attention on acquisitions 
      and partners in the high-profile Industrial Hemp sector in China, New 
      Zealand and the world markets. We are excited about this sector and 
      growth opportunity for Astika Holdings and look forward to accelerating 
      all of the Company’s acquisition plans. We appreciate the support and 
      are excited to lead the Company and its shareholders into the future."
    

      Since the Industrial Hemp industry is expanding at a rapid pace Astika 
      has accelerated the Company’s negotiations with its relationships in the 
      Nantong Region in China and New Zealand to expand into the sector. With 
      China being the single largest supplier of U.S. imports of raw and 
      processed hemp fiber and seed producer it will continue to have major 
      influence on market prices and thus on the year-to-year profits of 
      producers and processors in other countries. According to the 2012 
      Annual Retail Sales for Hemp Report, the Hemp Industries Association 
      (HIA) estimates that the total U.S. retail value of hemp products in 
      2012 was nearly $500 million. China is the largest producing and 
      exporting nation of hemp textiles and related products, as well as a 
      major supplier of these products to the United States. “China produces 
      38% of the world’s hemp fiber supply; and 80% of the world’s hemp seed 
      supply. The Chinese plan to increase the current 150,000 acres of hemp 
      production to over 1,000,000+ acres over the next decade,” Malinda 
      Geisler of the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center.
    

      Astika Holdings is in the process of making the necessary filings in 
      Form 8-K whichK, which will be filed on the US SEC EDGAR system 
      providing the specifics of developments. The new management intends to 
      position the Company for an up-listing to a higher exchange such as the 
      NASDAQ BX or NASDAQ, once the Company meets the financial status and 
      market share price for up-listing qualification." The Company has begun 
      the process of integrating management and moving its headquarters to 
      Grey Lynn, Auckland, New Zealand.

Astika Holdings, Inc. Proceeding with the Nantong Dredging Acquisition | Business Wire


























































Astika Holdings, Inc. Proceeding with the Nantong Dredging Acquisition




* China is the Largest Dredging Market in the World and is 
      Expanding Globally






April 24, 2014 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



AUCKLAND, New Zealand--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Astika Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") (OTCQB: ASKH) a strategic 
      acquisition company of service, agriculture and industrial companies 
      from the Nantong Region in China announced today that it is finalizing 
      the acquisition and accelerating the audit process in order to be able 
      to bid on dredging projects in China, Australia and Africa.
    


      Total trade between Africa and China exploded from USD 10bn in 2000 to 
      more than USD 200bn in 2012. Africa exports mainly raw materials to 
      China, whereas Africa imports finished products. China’s main African 
      trading countries are Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Libya, 
      Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, and Sudan. To illustrate the importance 
      of Africa, the inaugural trip of Chinese President Xi Jinping was to 
      Congo, South Africa, and Tanzania in March 2013. In Tanzania, the 
      Chinese President signed a deal to develop a new port at Bagamoyo (Capex 
      - Capital Expenditure USD 10bn). Although Africa ‘only’ accounted for 
      USD 753m or 7% of the global dredging market, it rose by a CAGR 
      (compound annual growth rate) of 11% between 2000 and 2011.
    

      The China and global dredging market will continue to grow due to (i) 
      growing China and world populations, (ii) higher energy demand, (iii) 
      increasing seaborne trade, (iv) rising size of container vessels, and 
      (v) rising sea level. Additionally, the Chinese government is increasing 
      its economical and political influence in Africa, Brazil, and the Middle 
      East, which could lead to dredging orders for Nantong Dredging in the 
      coming years. The Company believes that an acquisition of Nantong 
      Dredging's extensive mechanical engineering experience and network 
      throughout China will work with Astika's plans for the growing global 
      dredging sector.
    

      Mark Richards, the director for Astika Holdings stated, "We believe to 
      be on track for significant growth with this initial acquisition from 
      the Nantong Region to deliver revenue and earnings growth. The initial 
      acquisitions sales revenues are currently projected at $31.91M with an 
      EBITDA of $14.73M and a Net Profit of $9.7M. The acquisitions have the 
      potential to accelerate and triple revenues and earnings growth since 
      China is the largest dredging market in the world with more than 29% of 
      the $15bn total global dredging world market (*according to the 
      International Association of Dredging Companies - IADC). Nantong 
      Dredging is an important part of Astika’s ongoing strategy to add value 
      through successful project development and opportunistic high growth 
      sector acquisitions with efficient operations, while maintaining a low 
      risk profile through project diversification, astute financial 
      management and operations in secure jurisdictions. We appreciate the 
      support and are excited to lead the Company and its shareholders into 
      the future."
    

      The completion of the acquisition are dependent on, among other things, 
      the completion of due diligence satisfactory to the Company, and the 
      completion of the PCAOB audit under US GAAP. The parties have agreed 
      that the acquisition will not engage in any negotiations or discussions 
      with other potential acquirers and have also agreed to maintain the 
      confidentiality of all of the acquisitions in order to protect the 
      acquisition's competitive interests, and the interests of its many 
      customers and employees, during the period of the acquisitions. Astika 
      Holdings is in the process of making the necessary filings which will be 
      filed on the US SEC EDGAR system providing the specifics of developments 
      and intends to position the Company for an eventual up-listing to a 
      higher exchange such as the NASDAQ BX or NASDAQ, once the Company meets 
      the financial status and market share price for up-listing qualification.
