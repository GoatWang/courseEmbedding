During this time Warren has displayed amazing insights in the automotive industry in a challenging environment. His unique approach to Sales Management, Market and Product Planning and managing the Dealer Network has in my opinion a lot to do with the success experienced by Mahindra & Mahindra. 

Added to the above Warren has been very receptive to new marketing strategies in an industry that is notoriously slow to change.

I have now doubt that Warren will continue to play a vital role in making the Mahindra & Mahindra brands even more successful in the coming years.

Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

Olsen, Warren G.
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Wyoming:













Does Olsen, Warren G carry a valid contracting license?



Contractors in Wyoming are registered at the city and county level. The state does not register contractors in Wyoming











How important is contractor licensing in Wyoming?



Contractors may be required to take the International Code Council National Exam before registering at the local level. The state does not require an exam to become a contractor.











Your liability risk when hiring Olsen, Warren G



Contractors in Wyoming are not required by the state to carry general liability or workers compensation insurance.Local regulation may differ, it is always a good idea to only hire contractors with proof of active insurance.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Wyoming, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Arizona:













Does Olsen, Warren carry a valid contracting license?



Although the State of Arizona allows its residents to hire unlicensed contractors, it strongly encourages them to hire licensed contractors for remodeling or construction work.
Olsen, Warren currently holds license 12693 (Architect), which was Inactive when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in Arizona?



The Arizona Registrar of Contractors maintains high standards for licensing. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience (this varies a bit based on specialty).











Your liability risk when hiring Olsen, Warren



Licensed contractors in Arizona with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring Olsen, Warren



Residential contractors are required to provide a consumer protection bond. This may be in the form of a Surety Bond; cash deposit in the amount of $200,000; or payment into the Residential Contractors' Recovery Fund. Under certain conditions, consumers may be eligible to apply to the residential contractors' recovery fund and receive up to thirty thousand dollars to have the work corrected or completed.











What else should I know before hiring Olsen, Warren



Starting in '02, the ROC began performing a criminal background check on license applicants by checking their fingerprints against the FBI criminal database. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Arizona Registrar of Contractors recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
