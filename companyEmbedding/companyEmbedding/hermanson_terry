Development of real-time product cost measurement: A case study in a medium-sized manufacturing companyArticle · November 2016 with 36 ReadsDOI: 10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.10.018 1st Marc Wouters2nd Julia StecherAbstractData availability and the need for updating are important considerations when designing product costing systems. This paper describes the development of a costing system in a medium sized company to better understand these issues. The company wanted to be able to assess profitability of products on a more comprehensive basis than the contribution margins of products, which included merely the direct material costs. The resulting system uses practical capacity to compute rates and is based on a hybrid of machining and labor times. The most innovative aspect is the use of real-time data on machine times in manufacturing, in the context of a large number and frequently changing products. The study also helps to better understand the limitations of time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC), and it highlights the role of “data discovery” for the design of costing systems.Do you want to read the rest of this article?Request full-text

SiitonenReadEditorial policy and style information[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: SYNOPSIS : 
In this first part of a two-part paper, we develop a common platform to characterize several popular approaches for computing product costs. We describe four kinds of product costing systems: traditional volume-based systems, activity-based costing systems, time-driven activity-based costing systems, and resource consumption accounting. We employ a continuing numerical example to illustrate the commonalities and differences among these systems. In Part 2 of the paper, we evaluate the systems along multiple dimensions and offer suggestions for how we might blend the best features of various approaches.Article · Mar 2012 · SSRN Electronic JournalD.R.

ShevlinReadIntegrating Activity-Based Costing and Economic Value Added in Manufacturing[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This article presents a cost and perfonnance measurement system that integrates activity-based costing (ABC) with the economic value added financial perfonnance measure. This proposed ABC-and-EVA system is a management support tool for managing costs and capital. The integrated ABC-and-EVA system includes the rate of resource consumption (like traditional ABC), but it also includes capital demand. Implementation steps are illustrated. A traditional ABC system is compared with an ABC-and-EVA system by examining the cost for each activity at the first stage. A firm's capital information is then transformed into transparent capital charges using a newly developed method called activity-capital dependence (ACD) analysis. Changes to the end-product costs and possible changes to corporate strategies and business perfonnance in the proposed ABC-and-EVA system are discussed.Article · Apr 2015 Narcyz RoztockiKim LaScola NeedyRead„Time-driven activity-based costing: Motivation und anwendungsperspektiven“Article · Apr 2004 André ConersGerrit von der HardtReadA Comparison of Activity-Based Costing and Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Kaplan and Anderson (2004, 2007) developed time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) to provide a costing system that is easier to update than activity-based costing (ABC). The relationship between ABC and TDABC, however, has not been systematically investigated. We compare the accuracy of the two systems in two complementary ways: analytically and via a numerical experiment. Our analytical comparison generates formulas that describe how each system maps resources to activities and finally to products. We demonstrate that ABC aggregates resource-to-activity information by activities, while TDABC aggregates by resources. Our numerical experiment shows that TDABC performs better than ABC when resources are more traceable to activities. ABC performs better than TDABC when activities are more traceable to products or when both resources and activities are more traceable to activities and products, respectively. If each type of traceability is equally likely, then ABC may be the more robust approach. Finally, we examine the ease of updating the systems and find that TDABC data collection costs will be prohibitive if the firm must collect information about each product’s use of subtasks.Article · Jan 2014 Sophie HoozzeStephen C.
