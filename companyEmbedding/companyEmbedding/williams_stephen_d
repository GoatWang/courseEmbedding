Platinum: Stephen Williams Plays the Organ of St. John's Luthean Church, Allentown, Pennsylvania - [OAR-957]
$15.98














Stephen Williams plays the 87-rank Reuter pipe organ built
in 1993 at St. John's Lutheran Church,
Allentown, Pennsylvania, where Ernest M. Skinner &
Son Organ Company built in 1937 the original instrument from which many ranks
are incorporated. Added before the Reuter work of 1993 and retained is an
almost unique horizontal reed installed at the ceiling, high above the chancel.
The beloved organ enjoys excellent acoustics. Earlier, the Skinner organ had
been rebuilt by the Lehigh Organ Company of Macungie, Pennsylvania.

Platinum
In November of 1993, St. Johns
Lutheran Church
and the surrounding areas of downtown Allentown,
 Pennsylvania were buzzing with a
rare kind of excitement that comes around maybe once in a lifetime for
communities and church members, if theyre fortunate. It was this program they
were looking forward to  the dedicatory recital celebrating the newly
refurbished organ. The house was jammed with people, eagerly waiting to hear
what had been done to their organ.
In 1938, when the building was completed, a new organ
built by Ernest M. Skinner from Methuen,
 Massachusetts, was installed.
Skinner, known as one of the finest and most innovative builders of the time,
built an organ that boasted a unique orchestral sound with large diapasons,
color reeds, signature strings and flutes that created a beautiful, thick,
luscious cathedral effect. 
 In 1990, mechanical
difficulties left the organ struggling to make those sounds, noticeably
suffering from a deterioration of mechanisms that included leather parts,
electrical wiring, and many switches and controls the eye never sees. 
The organ committee, with an eclectic representation of
background, age, organ experience, and opinion, was asked to decide whether to
restore the instrument, rebuild it using as much of the old pipework as
possible, or ditch the whole idea of pipes and seek alternatives.
After consulting with a list of professionals in the
repair/restoration arena, representatives from the Reuter Organ Company in Lawrence, Kansas,
were sensitive to and sensible about this instrument. They were always very
clear and intentional about building an instrument that included repurposing
the best of old pipework into a scheme that would embrace our needs for the future.
Today, hosts of worshipers, brides, mourners, choirs, soloists,
instrumentalists, and those who admire this organ as a concert instrument are
thrilled time and again by its variety and flexibility of sounds, its powerful
and yet gentle presence, and its uncannily perfect fit in the environment.
Although a challenging decision in many ways, we praise
and laud those in decision making roles for their resolve to retain and
maintain a musical instrument of true integrity and excellence. In entering the
third decade of enjoying the benefits of a decision well made in 1993, we
believe now more than ever that future generations deserve to possess the best
tools available to carry on the goals that center around the work of our faith
and ministry, and the organ is most certainly one of those tools.
On a personal note, I would like to say that it is an
enormous privilege to play this instrument on almost a daily basis. The sounds
of this organ have time and again brought a sense of balance and perspective to
my thinking, and transported and challenged me to outer and otherwise
unrealized realms of beauty and music-making. For that, I am forever grateful.
Stephen Williams
 
The Music
The program begins with J. S. Bachs Toccata
and Fugue in D minor, one of the most immediately identifiable
pieces written for the organ. It showcases the Principal choruses and full
ensemble sounds of all the divisions. 
Even the Antiphonal organ, located in the balcony nearly a half block
away from the main case, is employed for secondary and echo effects.  The two Bach chorale preludes that follow
feature solo reed stops. The setting of the Advent hymn Wake! Awake, for
night is flying uses alternating trumpets from the Swell and Antiphonal
divisions, and at the end combines the two reeds. The well-known organ
transcription of Jesu, Joy of Mans Desiring from Cantata 147
uses string sounds with mutation stops from the Gemshorn row of the Choir
division to accompany the chorale tune on two of E. M. Skinners signature reeds,
the French Horn and the English Horn.
Felix Mendelssohns Sixth Sonata from Op. 65
is in the form of a theme and variations based on the chorale Vater unser im
Himmelreich (Our Father, God in Heaven Above).  The opening theme, or chorale, is presented
on the organs abundant 8 and 16 flue stops  a sound that fills the room
with both warmth and reassuring strength. The variations provide great
opportunities for exploration of flute ensembles and color reeds. The final
variation demonstrates a Germanic plenum toccata treatment in the
manuals superimposed over the melody on a strong pedal reed. As the variation
progresses, more principal and reed stops are added to create a full complement
by the end of the movement. The Fugue that follows continues to explore larger
ensembles, finally developing into a dialogue between the heroic Festival
Trumpet (in the ceiling) and the commanding Tuba (enclosed in the Choir). The
final movement is one of the most beautiful examples of the lyric Mendelssohn,
inspiring the use of gentle foundations and rich organ string tone.
The next two selections feature the organs two major
trumpet stops. First, English composer Percy Whitlocks Fanfare
uses the Reuter Tuba, voiced on 25 of wind, to full advantage. The works
calmer, quieter middle section features the Choir Clarinet, strings, and Swell
Vox Humana. The bookend sections of Antonio Solers Emperors Fanfare
are played almost entirely on what has been dubbed the Party Horn in the Sky,
horizontal trumpets mounted in the ceiling nearly eighty feet above the floor
at the entrance to the chancel. We are still trying to figure out whose crazy
idea it was to install these pipes in the ceiling, but we are sure glad they
did it, particularly since it has brought a smile to many brides at their
wedding entrance.
French Romantic organ music is often surrounded by a dark
and intense mysticism, as exemplified by the Belgian-born César Francks
beautifully crafted Choral in B minor. The choral here is not a
Lutheran-based hymn tune as it was for Bach and Mendelssohn, but is an original
theme that is set in a choral-like way. 
It develops as a seamless journey, unfolding with drama and gestures
that are distinctly orchestral. Stops of the organ are used to create subtle
shadings of light and dark by way of crescendo and decrescendo. Dame Gillian
Weir refers to this composition as, Francks best work, a giant passacaglia,
suggesting the tolling of a great bell as it moves from somber genesis through
an avalanche of sound to its peaceful end.
Petr Eben was a Czech composer whose music remains
delightfully challenging for both performer and listener. Moto ostinato
is the fascinating third piece from a suite entitled Sonntagsmusik (Sunday
Music), even though it is unlikely to be heard at most church services.
In an ongoing drama of good versus evil, this movement is based on the passage
in the Gospel of Mark (5:9), My name is Legion; for we are many. Eben uses a
militaristic, rhythmic ostinato to advance the music in volume and intensity
until it seems the ranks of organ pipes will literally break loose from their
orderly moorings. At the beginning, we hear the Great Cornet pitted against the
Great Trombone. In a quieter section, the French Horn and high-pitched stops
from the diminutive Gemshorn Cornet continue the dialogue.  The Swell Waldhorn and Choir Clarinet are
also paired before the larger ensembles begin to take over in a relentless
march to full organ, ultimately cap­ped by the Festival Trumpet.
The final two works on the program are signature pieces at
St. Johns,
having been played by musicians past and present for many, many occasions. Carillon
by American composer Leo Sowerby is a delightfully moving and quiet
piece. It is perfectly at home on the St.
  Johns instrument using Harp, Chimes, and French Horn,
along with the beautifully singing strings and flutes. The discerning ear will
detect in this recording a slight tuning inconsistency and a bit of extra
action noise when the Harp/Celesta is heard. The harp is a bona fide
component installed with the E. M. Skinner & Son organ in 1938. Perhaps it
existed in the organ built as Op. 525 in 1925 by Skinners previous firm, the
Skinner Organ Company of Boston, for a New York City church and acquired by Skinner when that
church replaced it in 1937 with a new Austin
organ. The harp has been a lovely and useful stop for many years, but now
suffers mechanical difficulties. When we were recording this CD, the harp was
having a particularly difficult time of it, but we decided to use it in honor
of its long years of faithful service instead of using the electronic harp
added in 2013 to join four other digital stops which had been installed in 1997
(as noted in the stoplist in this booklet).
Louis Viernes Carillon de Westminster (from
his 24 Pičces de Fantaisie, Op. 54, No 6) is based on the chimes of the
clock tower (now called the Elizabeth Tower in honor of Queen Elizabeth II) on
the north side of the Palace of Westminster in London, also nicknamed Big Ben
after the name of the largest (13.5 tons) of the towers four bells. Vierne
dedicated this piece to his friend, noted English organ builder Henry Willis,
who, as legend has it, hummed the tune to Vierne, although slightly
incorrectly. The truth will never be known, but it is also very likely Vierne
altered the tune to suit his own designs. Nevertheless, it is a magnificent
piece in every way, and a splendid way to end the celebration of this grand
organ!

The Organ
In 1993, the organ was completely rebuilt at the Reuter
Organ Company workshop in Lawrence,
 Kansas, including a new console,
new mechanisms for most of the organ, and many new pipes. The organ retains
many sets of pipes andthe original Harp stop installed at St.
 Johns in 1938 as Ernest M. Skinner & Son organ built in Methuen, Massachusetts, 
using some parts of the organ built as Op. 525 in 1925 by the Skinner Organ
Company of Boston.
Ernest M. Skinner (1866-1960) had founded that firm in 1901, led it to
preeminence among American organbuilders in the first third of the 20th
century, and left it in 1935 after it had become Aeolian-Skinner in 1932. The
original Op. 525 of 1925 was a three-manual console for the existing 1891 Odell
gallery organ at Marble Collegiate Reformed Church in New York City as well as a new 14-rank
chancel organ to replace the Odell ranks in the chancel. The Skinner organ was first
rebuilt in 1969 by the Lehigh Organ Company of Macungie, Pennsylvania.
