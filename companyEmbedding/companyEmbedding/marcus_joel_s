"I never think, 'Oh, I need to make that decision and I know I'm right.' That was hard to learn for a while, but I've learned that lesson," Joel S. Marcus said.

This interview with Joel S. Marcus, chief executive of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. What were some early influences for you?A. I grew up in Denver. My dad was an entrepreneur and had many careers — he built homes, sold cars, managed restaurants and then ended up in a political career. I was always interested in what he was doing, and I spent a lot of time with him when he was working. I wanted to be in business from Day 1. How else did your parents influence you?My father and mother were children of the Depression. They graduated from high school but never went to college. They were always very careful about managing money and believed in having no debt.Tell me about your college years. I studied accounting because I knew it was an easy way to have a job. That was my dad’s mentality — have a skill set that is depression-proof. In good times and bad times, everybody needs an accountant. Continue reading the main story

Then I went to law school, and after that went to Arthur Young, the accounting firm, to become a C.P.A. That’s where I met my first mentor, who was responsible for probably one of the most important things that ever happened in my life. He took me under his wing, and one day he said to me: “I’m teaching this tax class over at U.S.C. I’ve got a lot going on, and I’d like you to start teaching some of the classes.” I told him I had never taught before, but he said: “You’ll figure it out. Just go do it.”I found that I really liked teaching. He opened up the world of public speaking to me, and I also started doing seminars on taxation, which helped me get a lot of new clients.So how did you end up in your current role?I had shifted to a law firm, and another moment occurred that changed my life. A call came in from an investment banker to the head of the corporate law group, who had left the firm. But the secretary said to them: “Joel Marcus is here. He can help you.”I was a young partner at the firm, and she didn’t know if I could help them or not. But unlike some lawyers who treat administrative staff poorly, I had always been respectful and nice to them. She reached out to me purely because she liked me.The person calling was looking for someone to represent Kirin Brewery on a big biotech deal with Amgen. That led me to spend a lot of time in Japan and work on other deals in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. Because of that work, I was approached by the Jacobs Engineering Group to work on a business plan to launch a life science real estate company as a garage start-up. Then they asked me to run it. I told them no at first, but I eventually agreed.

Did you have management experience at that point?I had worked on projects with others, but I never had to hire people or inspire them before then. I was 47, and I had no operational or management experience up to that point. Zero. But I knew about accounting, tax and legal issues, so that was a pretty good start.

So 21 years later, how big is the company?We have about 200 employees.And what are some key insights you learned along the way about culture and leadership?I’ve always felt it’s good to keep a flat, decentralized and cross-matrix reporting organization. We don’t have an organizational chart; I actually ban org charts from being done because I don’t believe in them.I’m a big fan of Eric Schmidt and the book he co-wrote, “How Google Works,” where he says you should hire smart, creative people and then not put them in boxes. Give them a lot of authority to do some great things and you’re going to have great results. I don’t like hierarchical reporting structures.What other lessons?I learned early on not to take hard and fast positions. If somebody says they want to do something, I don’t normally say no. Instead, I’ll say, “Well, tell me why.” I may decide I’m against it, but I’m open to hearing you debate it.I never try to be dogmatic with a no answer. I always try to let the person win the day, and I’m egoless when making decisions. I never think, “Oh, I need to make that decision and I know I’m right.” That was hard to learn for a while, but I’ve learned that lesson.I also always try to get people to have multiple solutions for a problem. I never want to be put into a corner or forced down one road. There ought to be alternative options that can be successful for us, and the key is to have strategic optionality.How do you hire? What qualities do you look for, and what questions do you ask?I like great educational experience, intuition and instincts. I like somebody who has really done things that are a little bit different. One of the questions I like to ask is “If you could do anything, and money wasn’t an object, what would you do?” If somebody’s honest, their answer can be meaningful and tell you a lot about them.Another one is “What’s the biggest opportunity in your professional life that you’ve missed and shouldn’t have missed?” I’m not talking about a job opportunity; I mean a missed business opportunity. That reveals insight and reflection and ability to learn from mistakes. If somebody says, “I don’t think I’ve ever missed anything,” that’s pretty revealing, because we all make mistakes. I’m less interested in the fact that you missed something, but I am really interested in whether you recognized it and learned from it.You can also tell a lot about a candidate by the questions they ask. Do they ask basic questions that you could answer from our website? If they’ve clearly done their homework, then I’m impressed.

Mr. Marcus, 66, is the chairman and chief executive of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, or REIT, based in Pasadena, Calif. The company, which Mr. Marcus also co-founded in 1994, owns and operates properties in the life science industry, totaling around 17 million square feet, including the Alexandria Center for Life Science on Manhattan’s Far East Side.Interview conducted and condensed by VIVIAN MARINOQ. How much of your portfolio is in the New York area?A. We have about 750,000 square feet. And we’re just about to complete our second tower of 400,000-plus square feet at the only commercial life science park in the city, in Manhattan. We also hope to build a third building on the option parcel in New York.Q. What’s the timetable for that project?A. So we finished the first building in 2010, and it’s fully leased out. We started this next building in the fall of 2012; Roche moved in the first week of January, from Nutley, N.J.

Q. Can you tell me more about your deal with Hoffman-La Roche?A. It’s a 15-year lease. Between 10 and 20 years is pretty average for our leases. Continue reading the main story

They’re paying in the $70-per-square-foot range, and they’re leasing two floors, approximately 60,000 square feet. It’s their translational clinical group, which collaborates on a bunch of projects with a lot of the New York institutions. And probably over time they’ll move a number of research groups there. We’ve been told that could happen. They said they would like to have a deeper presence in New York, so we expect that over the next couple of years that they’ll add space.Q. And the rest of the building?A. Leased and in-process negotiations are approaching 60 percent. We’ve got one New York company that’s come in — I’m not at liberty to say who that is at the moment. We’ve got a number of floors that were leased to institutional tenants and we’re talking to three or four more about moving.Q. How much more expensive is it to develop this type of property versus traditional office space?A. It’s hard to say. In some markets, maybe a typical commercial office building might cost 70 percent of what a lab building would be. But in normal times lab rents have generally been 2X of what office rents have been.

Q. What is the range per square foot of your leasing rates?A. In North Carolina and Maryland, it may be $20 triple net for our labs, and the highest rate would be in New York, probably $80.Q. So what kind of year was 2013, and what are your expectations for this year?A. Pretty impressive. We beat our internal and external growth numbers.

Occupancy hit highs — it’s about 96 percent, which is among the highest it’s been in the history of the company. Our lease renewals and same-store growth were strong. Our dividends are up 21 percent over 2012, which is great.We’re projecting 7 percent growth in 2014, plus a dividend of 4.5 percent, so over 10 percent growth, which in this economy is not too bad.Q. Your company strategy has been to build or acquire, then hold. How often do you sell assets?A. We like not to because they’re hard to replace. But legacy assets that we bought early in the company’s history, we’ve turned quite a few of those assets. Last year we sold three groups of assets. We exited Worcester, Mass.; we lightened up our asset base in Gaithersburg, Md.; and we sold a big asset in Seattle.

Q. Who’s your biggest tenant?A. Novartis of Switzerland. They have a couple hundred thousand square feet, primarily in Cambridge, Mass. They also just leased some space from us in North Carolina, and they have some various spaces elsewhere.Q. What’s the average amount of space that you lease per tenant?A. Full-building users could be 100,000, 200,000 square feet. Multi-tenant users could be as low as 5,000 or 10,000.Q. So how did you come up with the Alexandria name?A. Well that’s interesting. My oldest son, who was at Wharton, came up with the name. My experience on Wall Street was that you always wanted an “A” name so it shows up first in whatever ticker or list there is. So “A” was a mandatory requirement. I also had done research with the New York Stock Exchange and the symbol “ARE” was available, so I told my son, “Think of something that the symbol would fit.” He came up with Alexandria, Egypt, which was the scientific capital of the ancient world. And the first lighthouse was in Alexandria Harbor. No one has ever discovered it because I guess it was probably destroyed by an earthquake or something like that. So he combined the name and the lighthouse as our logo.Q. You were an accountant and lawyer before you got into real estate.A. My dad was a home builder so I kind of grew up in a real estate family. I had gotten involved pretty deeply in the biotech and pharma industry when I was a lawyer and ended up representing many major pharma companies, biotech companies and venture capital firms.Our tenant base is like my client base before.

Joel Marcus Books


Joel Marcus teaches New Testament with an emphasis on the Gospels and the context of early Christianity in first-century Judaism. His publications include two monographs on Mark and the first part of a two-volume commentary on the same Gospel in the Anchor Bible series (Doubleday, 2000, 2009). His current research focuses on the parting of the ways between ancient Judaism and the Christianity of the first three centuries A.D.

Product Description▼▲
About this Volume: Mark 1-8Although it appears second in the New Testament, Mark is generally recognized as the first Gospel to be written. Captivating nonstop narrative characterizes this earliest account of the life and teachings of Jesus. In the first installment of his two-volume commentary on Mark, New Testament scholar Joel Marcus recaptures the power of Mark's enigmatic narrative and capitalizes on its lively pace to lead readers through familiar and not-so-familiar episodes from the ministry of Jesus.As Marcus points out, the Gospel of Mark can be understood only against the backdrop of the apocalyptic atmosphere of the Jewish rebellions of 66-73 c.e., during which the Roman army destroyed the Temple of Jerusalem (70 c.e.). While the Jewish revolutionaries believed that the war was "the beginning of the end" and that a messianic redeemer would soon appear to lead his people to victory over their human enemies (the Romans) and cosmic foes (the demons), for Mark the redeemer had already come in the person of Jesus. Paradoxically, however, Jesus had won the decisive holy-war victory when he was rejected by his own people and executed on a Roman cross.The student of two of this generation's most respected Bible scholars and Anchor Bible authors, Raymond E. Brown and J. Louis Martyn, Marcus helps readers understand the history, social customs, economic realities, religious movements, and spiritual and personal circumstances that made Jesus who he was. The result is a Bible commentary of the quality and originality readers have come to expect of the renowned Anchor Bible series. Challenging to scholars and enlightening to laypeople, Mark 1-8 is an invaluable tool for anyone reading the Gospel story.About the Anchor Yale Bible SeriesThe Anchor Yale ible Commentary Series is a project of international and interfaith scope in which Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish scholars from many countries contribute individual volumes. The project is not sponsored by any ecclesiastical organization and is not intended to reflect any particular theological doctrine.The Anchor Yale Series is committed to producing commentaries in the tradition established half a century ago by the founders of the series, William Foxwell Albright and David Noel Freedman. It aims to present the best contemporary scholarship in a way that is accessible not only to scholars but also to the educated nonspecialist. Its approach is grounded in exact translation of the ancient languages and an appreciation of the historical and cultural context in which the biblical books were written supplemented by insights from modern methods, such as sociological and literary criticism.

Author Bio▼▲
Joel Marcus is Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at the Boston University School of Theology, having previously taught at the University of Glasgow and Princeton Theological Seminary. Aside from his many scholarly publications in prestigious journals such as the Journal of Biblical Literature, Catholic Biblical Quarterly, and New Testament Studies, he is the author of two scholarly books on the Gospel of Mark as well as the more pastoral Jesus and the Holocaust: Reflections on Suffering and Hope.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"The long-awaited completion of the Marcus commentary on Mark has been well worth the wait. It provides the serious student of Mark one of the best commentaries available for the study of this Gospel. . . . Any serious student of the Gospel of Mark should possess this commentary."—Robert H. Stein, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society

Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff
Joel S. Marcus.



By Robert Weisman
	Globe Staff 
	October 12, 2014







Joel S. Marcus, founder, chairman, and chief executive of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, has focused the real estate investment trust on developing properties for the life sciences industry. While it operates in other biotechnology and medical technology hubs from New York to San Francisco, the Pasadena, Calif., company’s largest cluster of properties is in Greater Boston, where it owns 3.5 million square feet of space in Cambridge’s Kendall Square, along Route 128, and in Boston’s Longwood Medical Area. On a visit to Cambridge, the 67-year-old Marcus spoke with Globe reporter Robert Weisman. Here’s what he found out:

1Because he travels constantly, Marcus has mastered the difficult skill of sleeping on airplanes. That ensures he arrives at his destination rested and ready to do business.
“I can usually sleep standing up,” he said. “If you can’t sleep on red-eye flights, you’re really messed up. I was on a plane to Beijing last month, and I slept for 11 of the 12 hours.”

2Marcus, who lives in Southern California, comes to the East Coast about three times a month and often visits Alexandria’s local office in Cambridge’s Technology Square. That office, which has about 20 employees, is led by Greater Boston market director Thomas J. Andrews.
“If you look at our premise and our platform, urban innovation campuses that contain Triple-A buildings, this is one of the top locations. And I think for the life sciences industry, it’s really the number one location. There’s a pretty healthy demand for these sites.”



3Despite the high-profile move of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the South Boston waterfront, and Alexandria’s own development in the Longwood Medical Area, Marcus believes Cambridge — not Boston — will be the epicenter for life sciences in the future.
“I don’t see the industry gravitating to Boston in a significant way. The talent really resides here. Almost every CEO that we talk to is committed to Cambridge. So it’s a very highly focused industry here. And I think the tech presence is really here in Cambridge as well.”

4Demand for Alexandria’s properties in US innovation hubs is at an all-time high, with occupancy rates exceeding 97 percent across the company’s portfolio.
“That shows you that science and technology industry are really at a high-water mark. We have great projects we’re developing in almost every market. . .  We’re looking at at least one other big market in the US. But we’ve got a lot to do here, a lot to do in San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego, New York. . . We’ve got a $1 billion pipeline [of properties] that’s active, and another $1 billion-plus pipeline that’s right behind it in pre-construction.”


5Marcus grew up in Denver, the son of a developer. But after earning undergraduate and law degrees at UCLA, he began his career as a lawyer. He got into the biotechnology field in the early 1980s when he helped negotiate one of the industry’s first joint ventures between biotech pioneer Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., and the Kirin Brewery Company of Japan. Together they marketed erythropoietin, a hormone responsible for red blood cell production.
“That was the first big strategic alliance in the biotech industry. It turned out my brother needed that drug actually to save his life, strangely enough. So it’s kind of weird to see how sometimes things have a complete turnaround.”

6A passionate traveler, Marcus likes to visit countries off the beaten track. Last year he stamped his passport in Uzbekistan, Tibet, Laos, and Myanmar. Next up: Ethiopia and Namibia.
“I’ve probably been to 50 or 60 countries.”

7Marcus, a one-time Air Force medic, also likes jumping out of airplanes and off bridges with family members.
“I try to do unusual things. I’ve done a bunch of sky diving. I took my daughter on her 18th birthday. Not tandem, but true free fall from 13,000 feet. She likes rare air, too. I was in New Zealand and my wife and I jumped off the Kawarau Bridge, bungee jumping.”

Pay less interest with a lower fixed-rate loan from Marcus. 

Marcus offers personal loans with rates as low as 6.99% APR—that's lower than most high interest rate credit cards. Also, your rate never changes during the life of your loan.

No prepayment fees

          You can always pay off your loan earlier.






No late fees

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
