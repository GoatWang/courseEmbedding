Miami-based Susan D. Kronick, chairman of Miami City Ballet, has been named to the board of directors of American Airlines Group. Before her retirment, she was vice chairman of Macy’s Inc. and also served as a previous CEO of Burdines. She also serves on the boards of Hyatt Hotels, and the Knight Foundation. The move gives Miami two seats on the board the region’s dominant air carrier; Alberto Ibarguen, president and CEO of the Knight Foundation, also serves on the AA board.
