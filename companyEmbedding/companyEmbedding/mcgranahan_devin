Fiserv Names Devin B. McGranahan Group President | Business Wire
























































Fiserv Names Devin B. McGranahan Group President






October 12, 2016 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BROOKFIELD, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fiserv, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), a leading global provider of financial services 
      technology solutions, announced today that Devin McGranahan has been 
      named president of its Billing and Payments Group, effective November 1, 
      2016. McGranahan succeeds Rahul Gupta, who will leave Fiserv in December 
      2016 to pursue other interests.
    


      McGranahan brings more than 25 years of business and leadership 
      experience to Fiserv. He most recently served as a senior partner at 
      McKinsey and Company, engaging with leading financial services companies 
      on a broad range of strategy, payments and business-building 
      opportunities. He also held a variety of management roles at the firm, 
      including leader of the Global Insurance Practice and co-chair of the 
      Global Senior Partner Election Committee. In addition, McGranahan served 
      as co-leader of the North America Financial Services Practice.
    

      “Devin brings unique perspective to Fiserv. As part of his role at 
      McKinsey he worked closely with our organization over the past decade, 
      and also advised multiple companies, many of which are Fiserv clients, 
      on navigating the transformation of financial services,” said Jeffery 
      Yabuki, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fiserv. “His proven 
      strategic leadership in financial services makes him a strong addition 
      to the Fiserv team.”
    

      McGranahan earned an MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School, 
      a bachelor’s degree in finance from The Wharton School of the University 
      of Pennsylvania and a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from 
      the University of Pennsylvania. Active in the community, he is chair of 
      the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and president of Lake Ontario Optimist 
      Team (LOOT), a children’s educational sailing program.
    

      McGranahan succeeds Rahul Gupta, who will leave after more than a decade 
      in key leadership positions at Fiserv and more than 30 years serving the 
      financial services and payments industries. Gupta was named president of 
      the Billing and Payments Group in 2014 and will assist with the 
      transition through the remainder of 2016.
    

      “Rahul is leaving Fiserv to pursue opportunities closer to his home in 
      California,” said Yabuki. “He has played an important role in our 
      company’s evolution, driving success for Fiserv across a variety of 
      payments-specific leadership positions over the last 10 years. We thank 
      him for his many contributions and wish him and his family well in the 
      future.”

Research Interests




I am drawn to rangeland ecosystems because they provide unique opportunities to apply ecological research to problems that affect how humans interact with land. I seek to contribute to the sustainable use and management of working landscapes, especially those relied upon for agriculture. 
My research effort is primarily focused on fire and grazing ecology in grasslands. I am particularly interested in understanding factors that affect fire behavior and fire effects in fire-dependent ecosystems, including plant community composition, disturbance regimes, land-use, and environmental change. 
I apply a variety of approaches, including sampling and modeling grassland fuelbeds and fire behavior, and multivariate analysis of ecological communities. I have experience in several biomes, including the North American tallgrass prairie and grassland/savanna ecosystems in Southern Africa.








Background and education

Lab news


 
New Graduate Research Opportunities:
 
MSc in grassland fuelbed ecology
Funding is available to study patterns of fuel moisture and fuel load, and measure fire behavior and effects, using empirical data and models. Work will be in the lab and in mixed-grass prairie using open-source/DIY hardware and software. Interest in using and learning R and Arduino microcontrollers for monitoring environmental data (fire and soil moisture) is required. Access the .pdf linked above for more info.
The position is available immediately; a start date in Spring 2017 is preferred.
