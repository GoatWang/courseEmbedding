Hyundai Ioniq Electric car to get 200 miles of range 'soon'








Stephen Edelstein




Nov 16, 2016

 

2017 Hyundai Ioniq (European spec), 2016 Geneva Motor ShowEnlarge PhotoHyundai's product planners seem to have a bit of an issue on their hands.
The South Korean automaker is set to launch an all-electric version of its Ioniq hatchback, alongside the conventional hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions of that model.
Called the Ioniq Electric, it has an estimated driving range of 110 miles EPA-rated range of 124 miles.

Unfortunately, the Ioniq Electric will arrive just as an anticipated new crop of mainstream-priced 200-mile electric cars—led by the 238-mile 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV—will start to appear at U.S. dealers.
But Hyundai is already planning a response to that trend, it seems.
It plans to launch a version of the Ioniq Electric with at least 200 miles of range by 2018, reports industry trade journal Automotive News (subscription required).
2017 Hyundai Ioniq Electric (European spec), 2016 Geneva Motor ShowEnlarge Photo
That's what Ahn Byung-ki—director of Hyundai's eco-vehicle performance group—said during a recent media event at the carmaker's Michigan technical center.
Ahn said the current range will satisfy most consumer's typical needs, but that it still "is not enough" for the long term.
A range in the neighborhood of the 200 miles would allow the Ioniq Electric to compete with the Bolt EV as well as the 215-mile Tesla Model 3, which Tesla says will start production at the end of next year.

The next-generation Nissan Leaf is also expected to have at least one version with a 200-mile range.
It will likely be unveiled and launched sometime over the next 18 months to replace the current Leaf, which has a 107-mile range.
Ahn did not specify how Hyundai will increase the Ioniq Electric's range, but fitting a battery pack with a significantly larger form factor could pose a challenge.
2017 Hyundai Ioniq (European spec), 2016 Geneva Motor ShowEnlarge Photo
That's because—rather than putting a flat battery pack under the passenger compartment floor as in a Leaf or Chevy Bolt EV—Hyundai sited its battery under the rear seat, and between the rear wheels.
It's possible, one Hyundai executive hinted last year, that it might extend the pack into the tunnel between the Ioniq's seats.
Otherwise, increasing battery capacity by two-thirds would require lithium-ion cells with energy density that is two-thirds greater, a tall order for any cell supplier even given recent improvements in cell capacity.

Hyundai says the Ioniq Electric and Ioniq Hybrid models will go on sale before the end of this year, while the plug-in hybrid will follow in 2017.
At the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, Hyundai also announced Amazon Alexa smart-home integration, which includes the ability to start and stop remote charging via voice command.
This feature will be available on the Ioniq Electric and Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid, as well as the Sonata Plug-In Hybrid midsize sedan.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREThe Western Front: Landscape, Tourism And Heritageby Miles, StephenThe Western Front has become, once again, and after 100 years, an important and increasingly popular tourist destination. The Centenary is already encouraging large numbers of visitors to engage with this highly poignant landscape of war and to commemorate the sacrifice and loss of a previous generation. Interest is also being sharpened in the 'places of war' as battle-sites, trench-systems, bunkers and mine craters gain a clearer identity as war heritage. For the first time this book brings together the three strands of heritage, landscape and tourism to provide a fresh understanding of the multi-layered nature of the Western Front. The book approaches the area as a rich dynamic landscape which can be viewed in a startling variety of ways: historically, materially, culturally, and perceptually. To illustrate these two dominant interpretations of the region's landscape - commemorative and heritage - are highlighted and their relationship to tourism explored. Tourism is a lens through which these layers can be peeled away, and each understood and interacted with according to the individual's own knowledge, motivation, and degree of emotional engagement.Tourism is not regarded here as a passive phenomenon, but as an active agent that can determine, dictate and inscribe this evocative landscape. The Western Front:  Heritage, Landscape and Tourism is a timely addition to our increasing interest in the First World War and the places where it was fought. It will be indispensable to those who seek a deeper understanding of the conflict from previously undervalued perspectives.World War ICondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Synopsis
About this title




This work examines the changing nature of young people's lives at the start of a new century. Arguing that the sociology of youth has struggled to bridge the gap between structural and cultural conceptions of youth, this book emphasizes the notion of lifestyle as an enlightening means of addressing young people's relationship with social change. Against a social and cultural backdrop characterized by postmodern fragmentation, risk and globalization, young people are apparently finding individualized transitions into adulthood increasingly difficult, and this book shows how lifestyles play an important role. It considers key aspects of young people's lifestyles such as their relationship to rave, the media, and consumption in general, as a means of constructing identities. In this introduction to a complex filed, the author outlines the dilemmas faced by sociology, and examines the role played by consumer lifestyles in constructing who and what young people are in a rapidly changing world.

About the Author:
                                                    Steve joined Brighton from the University of Liverpool where he was part of the management group of" Impacts 08", the research programme designed to assess the social, cultural and economic impacts of European Capital of Culture. Perhaps the most bizarre experience of his academic career was presenting the proposal for "Impacts 08" to a panel chaired by Loyd Grossman.  Steve previously worked at Northumbria University where he was Head of Research for the Centre for Cultural Policy and Management and where he conducted a large-scale research project into the impact of cultural investment on Newcastle Gateshead Quayside. Many years previously Steve undertook his PhD in the Behavioural Sciences Department at the University of Huddersfield in which he was concerned with the relationship between consumption and identity amongst young people.

Book Description OPEN UNIVERSITY PRESS, United Kingdom, 2000. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. * What impact has social change had upon young people? * To what extent do consumer lifestyles play a key role in structuring identities? * How successful has sociology been in dealing with the nature of young people s lives? Youth Lifestyles in a Changing World is an accessible examination of the changing nature of young people s lives at the start of a new century. Arguing that the sociology of youth has struggled to bridge the gap between structural and cultural conceptions of youth, this book emphasizes the notion of lifestyle as an enlightening means of addressing young people s relationship with social change. Against a social and cultural backdrop characterized by postmodern fragmentation, risk and globalization, young people are apparently finding individualized transitions into adulthood increasingly difficult, and this book shows how lifestyles play an important role. It considers key aspects of young people s lifestyles such as their relationship to rave, the media, and consumption in general, as a means of constructing identities.In this clear introduction to a complex field, Miles outlines the dilemmas faced by sociology, and examines the role played by consumer lifestyles in constructing who and what young people are in a rapidly changing world.

Supershow - The Last Great Jam of the 60's

Various Artists: Supershow
DV


Barcode: 5034504922372


In 1969 the cream of contemporary rock, blues and jazz talent gathered in a disused linoleum factory to the west of London. Filmed over two days, they produced some magical collaborations, clearly inspired by the company they were all keeping.The list of featured artists is a whos who of the period including Eric Clapton, Jon Hisemans Colosseum, Buddy Miles, Stephen Stills, Jack Bruce, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Modern Jazz Quartet, Buddy Guy, Roland Kirk Quartet and Glen Campbell, with a full supporting cast.The two day session was an opportunity for many of these musicians to play outside of their normal genre, so Roland Kirk plays jazz with his quartet and then joins in with the rockers, the Modern Jazz Quartet give an interlude of ethereal calm before Buddy Guy, Jack Bruce, Buddy Miles and Dick Heckstall-Smith take liberties with Mary Had A Little Lamb!

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.
