Equity - Miles Capital













































Active Equity Management
Equity Philosophy
We believe that the key to generating long term excess returns for clients is fundamental stock selection. We focus on buying:

High quality stocks;
With strong upside versus downside potential;
At a time when the market is also appreciating them.

This approach is managed within a risk framework to minimize impacts from unintended factors.







Equity Process
Our well defined and repeatable investment process places an emphasis on stock selection and portfolio construction, and is singularly focused on maintaining a specific portfolio profile.
Miles Capital's equity team leverages a proprietary relative ranking process, focused on:

Sector-by-sector analysis of quantitative factors;
In-depth fundamental research to identify stocks with desired alpha generating characteristics;
Unique assessment of upside versus downside potential;
Continual risk monitoring; and
A strict sell discipline.

Risk management is the foundation of our process. Our investment approach is focused on:

What are analysts saying about Hologic stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Hologic stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Hologic witnessed a lackluster performance at its Diagnostics segment in the last reported quarter. Furthermore, the blood screening divestiture is expected to impede the company’s growth momentum in the days ahead. Foreign currency headwinds and a competitive landscape also continue to pose challenges. On a positive note, the company has been registering strong top line growth in recent times driven by strength in molecular diagnostics, GYN Surgical and Breast Health businesses. The company's raised guidance for fiscal 2017 indicates that this growth momentum should continie through rest of the year.  In fact, the recent European approval for the company's new Panther system should boost growth in the coming quarter. For the last three months, Hologic has been trading above the broader Medical Instruments industry in terms of price. Hologic’s strong cash position is another encouraging factor." (7/12/2017)
2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "HOLX is acquiring Cynosure (CYNO) for $1.44B with an all-cash tender offer. CYNO is a leading aesthetics company that competes in a $2B market growing in the double-digits with a range of products used for hair removal, body contouring, skin revitalization, and other cosmetic procedures. HOLX expects CYNO to increase its revenue growth and add $0.13-0.15 to its FY18E EPS. HOLX has now effectively swapped a business with declining sales and margins (blood screening) for one with double-digit growth and improving margins (CYNO). With the blood screening EPS "hole" now partially filled and HOLX facing increasingly easy comps over the next three quarters, we upgrade to Buy." (2/15/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.69)Consensus Price Target: $47.69 (5.96% upside)
