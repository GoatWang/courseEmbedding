Align Technology Names Julie Tay as Vice President Asia Pacific


Newly Created Position to Focus on Further Growth and Expansion in Align's Fastest Growing Region


SAN JOSE, CA and SINGAPORE -- (Marketwire) -- 02/25/13 --

 Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALGN) today announced that it has hired Julie Tay as vice president Asia Pacific, effective March 1, 2013. Ms. Tay will report to Richard Twomey, vice president international, and assume responsibility for Align's entire Asia Pacific region, which includes its current direct country markets in China and Japan as well as 13 indirect country markets. In this newly created position, Ms. Tay will focus on strategic development and operational execution for all Align products and services in this fastest growing region 
for the Company.




"Asia Pacific represents significant growth potential for Align and I am very pleased to have Julie join our international team to help build and scale our business," said Richard Twomey, vice president international. "We expect Julie's knowledge and understanding of the region and proven track record of successfully launching major healthcare-branded products in these markets to be very beneficial to our continued growth and expansion."




Ms. Tay has extensive management experience in the Asia Pacific region overseeing the development and launch of several major healthcare products. Most recently, Ms. Tay was regional head of Bayer Healthcare (Diabetes Care) overseeing operations in Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, China, India, Australia and Southeast Asia where she grew the business into a sustainable and profitable operation in three years. Prior to Bayer, Ms. Tay spent more than 20 years 
in marketing and commercial general management in the Asia Pacific region, including 15 years with Johnson and Johnson Medical where she was instrumental in establishing the LifeScan franchise and in successfully launching the SmartScan, One Touch Ultra, and One Touch Horizon brands.




As previously announced, Align is terminating the distribution agreement with the Invisalign Asia Pacific distributorship which consists of Invisalign Australia Pty. Ltd., Invisalign Hong Kong Ltd., ICA Ortho Services (New Zealand), ICA Ortho Services Pte. Ltd. (Singapore). As a result on May 1, 2013 four of the largest indirect country markets of Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore will revert back to a direct sales region under Align Technology, B.V. The remaining nine indirect country markets in Brunei, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam will likely continue under a distribution model.



About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.The Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express 10, Invisalign Express 5, Invisalign 
Lite, Invisalign i7, and Vivera Retainers. To learn more about Invisalign or to find an Invisalign trained doctor in your area, please visit www.invisalign.com.



Cadent Holdings, Inc. is a subsidiary of Align Technology and is a leading provider of 3D digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry. The Cadent family of products includes the iTero intra-oral scanning systems, OrthoCAD iCast and OrthoCAD iRecord. For additional information, please visit www.cadentinc.com.
