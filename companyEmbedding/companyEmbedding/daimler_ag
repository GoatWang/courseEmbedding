Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include, for example, the passenger safety cell with crumple zone, the airbag and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium car makers. Development focuses on emission-free, accident-free and networked driving . By way of example, Mercedes-Benz has been investing in the development of alternative drive systems for some time and, with the B 250 e, has a mass-produced electric vehicle with very high everyday practicality in its product range. Another core technology on the way to emission-free driving is the plug-in hybrid. A total of ten models with this type of drive system will be available at dealers by 2017, including the previously introduced variants Mercedes S 500 e, C 350 e as a Saloon and Estate as well as the GLE 500 e 4MATIC and the GLC 350 e 4MATIC.Among other things, excellent driver assistance systems that we group under the concept of "Intelligent Drive" ensure the safety of our Mercedes-Benz vehicles In addition, our engineers are intensively researching innovative future technologies: with autonomous driving, we are setting industry-wide standards and already offer semi-autonomous driving functions. In addition, we are pushing ahead significantly with the complete networking of cars with their environment.

The Mercedes-Maybach S 600 Pullman is the Mercedes-Maybach for very special requirements: with a length of about six-and-a-half metres and a wheelbase of 4.4 metres, it offers rear passengers the largest legroom in the segment. The passengers can optionally sit facing each other behind the partition. The Mercedes-Maybach S 600 Pullman can be individualised and personalised right down to the last detail.

For the purposes of developing the performance vehicles, the AMG engineers are involved in the development process for a new Mercedes-Benz model directly from the planning phase. Mercedes-AMG works in parallel on an independent vehicle and is responsible for the drivetrain, chassis, brake system, electronics, design and aerodynamics of the AMG model, as well as for the testing. Fully independently developed sports cars, such as the Mercedes-AMG GT and the gull-wing Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, underscore the brand's independence in terms of engineering and visual design and also make their mark in impressive style in international racing series in accordance with FIA's GT3 rules. 



















one man one engine - Michael Kuebler (Mercedes-AMG)


The high-performance engines on board the AMG models are traditionally assembled by hand by a single engine fitter. In accordance with AMG's "One Man – One Engine" philosophy, a single technician is responsible for a complete engine, as documented by the corresponding signature on the AMG engine badge.


The brand's product range further includes the new AMG Sport models, which offer an entry-level introduction to the AMG brand world. With increased engine power, all-wheel-drive as standard and special chassis components and brake systems, they allow a broader clientele to experience the fascination of AMG's special DNA.


About the beginnings …

















AMG-Headquarter in Affalterbach


Mercedes-AMG was founded in 1967 by Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher, two former Daimler-Benz engineers. Initially based in the Swabian town of Burgstall, in 1976 the company moved to Affalterbach, where its plant is still located today. Mercedes-AMG GmbH has belonged to Daimler AG since 2005. Mercedes-AMG GmbH has a workforce of over 1300 today and is managed by Tobias Moers (Chairman of the Board of Management) and Emmerich Schiller.

History[edit]
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.
An Agreement of Mutual Interest was signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie (founded 1883 by Karl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach).
Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming Daimler-Benz AG—and agreed that, thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of Mercedes-Benz on their automobiles.
In 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced the world's largest cross-border deal ever, valued at US$38billion,[5] and the resulting change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG".
In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management (see below), the name[note 1] of the parent company was changed to simply "Daimler AG".
In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee.[6]

Merger with Chrysler[edit]




The former logo of Daimler Chrysler AG.


In a so-called "Merger of Equals," or "Marriage made in Heaven", according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp,[7] Daimler-Benz AG and United States-based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as Daimler-Benz AG bought 92% of Chrysler, and 8% of Chrysler remained independent[8] and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz's non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, "debis AG" for short, (created in 1989 to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group) to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. debis AG reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.[9][10]
The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005.[11] The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler, (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.[12]
Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.[13] As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
Sale of Chrysler[edit]
Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion.[citation needed] Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the smallest of the "Big 3" U.S. automakers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.
Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.[14]
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor,[15] but on 3 August 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.[16]
The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler's financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.
Since Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States, Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is, (as of 2016), still working to integrate Chrysler's products into the Fiat portfolio, such as Lancia and Chrysler's namesake brand, and Fiat's namesake brand with Dodge. Interestingly, despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the Daimler/Chrysler split, the fourth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee shares a platform with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class.[17] This also includes the Chrysler LX platform vehicles which initially used Mercedes-Benz components since its 2005 introduction.
Automated cars[edit]
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[18] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Management[edit]
Dieter Zetsche became the Chairman of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars after 1 January 2006 as well as member of the Board of Management since 1998. He was former President and CEO of the Chrysler, LLC (previously owned by Daimler AG); he may be best known in the United States as "Dr. Z" from a Chrysler advertising campaign called "Ask Dr. Z".[19]
Current (as of 10 February 2017) members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG are:

Dr. Dieter Zetsche: Chairman of the Board as well as Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.
Renata Jungo Brüngger: Integrity and Legal Affairs.
Ola Källenius: Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales.[20]
Wilfried Porth: Head of Human Resources and Labor Relations.
Hubertus Troska: Greater China.
Bodo Uebber: Head of Finance and Controlling as well as Financial Services.
Dr. Thomas Weber: Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.

The board of management total members of seven, after the unexpected resignation on 28 January 2014 of Andreas Renschler, former head of Manufacturing and Procurement Mercedes-Benz Cars & Mercedes-Benz Vans, had been brought back to eight after the nomination on 1 January 2015 of Swedish-born Ola Källenius to the board of management as head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. After the sudden departure of Wolfgang Bernhard in February 2017, that number returned to seven.
As of May 2015[update], the twenty members of Daimler AG's supervisory board are: Manfred Bischoff (Chairman), Michael Brecht (Deputy Chairman), Paul Achleitner, Sari Baldauf, Michael Bettag, Bernd Bohr, Clemens Börsig, Jürgen Hambrecht, Petraea Heynike, Andrea Jung, Joe Kaeser, Ergun Lümali, Sabine Maaßen, Wolfgang Nieke, Bernd Pischetsrieder, Valter Sanches, Jörg Spies, Elke Tönjes-Werner, Frank Weber, Roman Zitzelsberger.[21]

In April 2013, Daimler sold its shares in EADS,[23] and the same year, EADS restructured itself into a new aerospace company named Airbus, into which Daimler AG has no shareholding.

On the side of the public sector, the KfW banking group holds 13%, HGV Hamburger Gesellschaft für Vermögens- und Beteiligungsverwaltung (State of Hamburg) holds 10%, Hannoversche Beteiligungsgesellschaft (State of Lower Saxony) holds 5%, Bayerische Landesbodenkreditanstalt, Anstalt der Bayerischen Landesbank holds 3.5%, LfA Förderbank Bayern holds 1.5%, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg and Landeskreditbank Baden-Württemberg – Förderbank (L-Bank) each holds 2.5%, and Bremer Investitions-Gesellschaft (State of Bremen) holds 2%.

North Charleston expansion[edit]
On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. Currently,[when?] these vans are set up in Germany, then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001.[24]

25% MV Agusta of Italy[29]
12% Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC)
11% KAMAZ of Russia
5% Aston Martin

At the end of 2011 McLaren Group completely bought back the stocks from Daimler.
17 April 2013, Daimler AG exits EADS,[30] the parent company of Airbus of Europe.
Joint ventures and alliances[edit]
Beijing Automotive Group[edit]
In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC), becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.[31]
Daimler works with China's Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.[32]
Denza[edit]
In 2010 BYD Auto and Daimler AG created a new joint venture Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. In 2012 the new brand Denza was launched by the joint venture to specialise in electric cars.
Fujian Benz[edit]
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).
Renault-Nissan and Daimler Alliance[edit]
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dr. Dieter Zetsche announced a partnership between the three companies.[33] The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines)[34] and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.[35]
Alternative propulsion[edit]
Biofuel research[edit]
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.[36]
Electric[edit]
Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called "E-Mobility Berlin".[37]
Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009,[38][39] Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla's battery technology.[40] Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.[41] Daimler's joint venture with BYD[42] has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.
In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use.[43] Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology,[44][45] and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.[46]
Fuel cell[edit]
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus. In 2013, the Renault-Nissan/Daimler alliance was joined by Ford to further develop the fuel cell technology with an aim for production by 2017.[47][48]
Hybrid[edit]
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid.[49] and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trailed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.
Formula One[edit]
Main article: Mercedes-Benz in Formula One
On 16 November 2009, Daimler (45.1%) och Aabar Investments (30%) purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK, with Ross Brawn remaining team principal.,[50] However, the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler sold back its stake in McLaren in stages that ended in 2011.[51] Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2015, after which McLaren switched to engines from Honda.[52]
Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011.[53] In November 2012 Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares and the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) is now wholly owned by Daimler.[54]
Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains, which as of 2017, supplies engines to Force India[55] and Williams,[56] in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.
Bribery and corruption[edit]
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG's German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Daimler itself had to pay US$185 million as a settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.
Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler's compliance with anti-bribery laws.
U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.[57]
The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America.[58] Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units "continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials", though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.
In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler's strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.[citation needed]
According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious[according to whom?] dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, Ruhnama, translated into German.[59][60]
Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.[57]
U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. "In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe", the court papers said.[61]
Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a "long-standing practice" of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.
"Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business," said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department's criminal division.[62]
"It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice", Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.[63]
"We have learned a lot from past experience," Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.[this quote needs a citation]
As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business.[64] The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol "DAI" on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker's payments in countries around the globe.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a "just resolution".
The primary case is USA v. Daimler AG, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:10-cr-00063-RJL .[65][66]
Notes[edit]

^ Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG, the German car manufacturer created when DaimlerChrysler was split up. Jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the German company to use the Daimler brand as the title of a trading company, a trade name or a corporate name – rights that it did not hold previously. The renegotiated terms did not affect Jaguar's rights to build Daimler cars. A spokesman for Jaguar said: “The extended usage agreement does not affect either company's existing right to use the Daimler name for a product.” — The Times 28 July 2008.

History[edit]
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.
An Agreement of Mutual Interest was signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie (founded 1883 by Karl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach).
Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming Daimler-Benz AG—and agreed that, thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of Mercedes-Benz on their automobiles.
In 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced the world's largest cross-border deal ever, valued at US$38billion,[5] and the resulting change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG".
In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management (see below), the name[note 1] of the parent company was changed to simply "Daimler AG".
In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee.[6]

Merger with Chrysler[edit]




The former logo of Daimler Chrysler AG.


In a so-called "Merger of Equals," or "Marriage made in Heaven", according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp,[7] Daimler-Benz AG and United States-based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as Daimler-Benz AG bought 92% of Chrysler, and 8% of Chrysler remained independent[8] and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz's non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, "debis AG" for short, (created in 1989 to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group) to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. debis AG reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.[9][10]
The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005.[11] The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler, (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.[12]
Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.[13] As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
Sale of Chrysler[edit]
Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion.[citation needed] Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the smallest of the "Big 3" U.S. automakers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.
Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.[14]
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor,[15] but on 3 August 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.[16]
The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler's financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.
Since Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States, Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is, (as of 2016), still working to integrate Chrysler's products into the Fiat portfolio, such as Lancia and Chrysler's namesake brand, and Fiat's namesake brand with Dodge. Interestingly, despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the Daimler/Chrysler split, the fourth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee shares a platform with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class.[17] This also includes the Chrysler LX platform vehicles which initially used Mercedes-Benz components since its 2005 introduction.
Automated cars[edit]
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[18] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Management[edit]
Dieter Zetsche became the Chairman of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars after 1 January 2006 as well as member of the Board of Management since 1998. He was former President and CEO of the Chrysler, LLC (previously owned by Daimler AG); he may be best known in the United States as "Dr. Z" from a Chrysler advertising campaign called "Ask Dr. Z".[19]
Current (as of 10 February 2017) members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG are:

Dr. Dieter Zetsche: Chairman of the Board as well as Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.
Renata Jungo Brüngger: Integrity and Legal Affairs.
Ola Källenius: Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales.[20]
Wilfried Porth: Head of Human Resources and Labor Relations.
Hubertus Troska: Greater China.
Bodo Uebber: Head of Finance and Controlling as well as Financial Services.
Dr. Thomas Weber: Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.

The board of management total members of seven, after the unexpected resignation on 28 January 2014 of Andreas Renschler, former head of Manufacturing and Procurement Mercedes-Benz Cars & Mercedes-Benz Vans, had been brought back to eight after the nomination on 1 January 2015 of Swedish-born Ola Källenius to the board of management as head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. After the sudden departure of Wolfgang Bernhard in February 2017, that number returned to seven.
As of May 2015[update], the twenty members of Daimler AG's supervisory board are: Manfred Bischoff (Chairman), Michael Brecht (Deputy Chairman), Paul Achleitner, Sari Baldauf, Michael Bettag, Bernd Bohr, Clemens Börsig, Jürgen Hambrecht, Petraea Heynike, Andrea Jung, Joe Kaeser, Ergun Lümali, Sabine Maaßen, Wolfgang Nieke, Bernd Pischetsrieder, Valter Sanches, Jörg Spies, Elke Tönjes-Werner, Frank Weber, Roman Zitzelsberger.[21]

North Charleston expansion[edit]
On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. Currently,[when?] these vans are set up in Germany, then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001.[24]

In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC), becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.[31]
Daimler works with China's Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.[32]
Denza[edit]
In 2010 BYD Auto and Daimler AG created a new joint venture Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. In 2012 the new brand Denza was launched by the joint venture to specialise in electric cars.
Fujian Benz[edit]
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).
Renault-Nissan and Daimler Alliance[edit]
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dr. Dieter Zetsche announced a partnership between the three companies.[33] The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines)[34] and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.[35]
Alternative propulsion[edit]
Biofuel research[edit]
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.[36]

Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called "E-Mobility Berlin".[37]
Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009,[38][39] Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla's battery technology.[40] Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.[41] Daimler's joint venture with BYD[42] has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.
In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use.[43] Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology,[44][45] and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.[46]
Fuel cell[edit]
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus. In 2013, the Renault-Nissan/Daimler alliance was joined by Ford to further develop the fuel cell technology with an aim for production by 2017.[47][48]
Hybrid[edit]
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid.[49] and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trailed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.
Formula One[edit]

On 16 November 2009, Daimler (45.1%) och Aabar Investments (30%) purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK, with Ross Brawn remaining team principal.,[50] However, the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler sold back its stake in McLaren in stages that ended in 2011.[51] Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2015, after which McLaren switched to engines from Honda.[52]
Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011.[53] In November 2012 Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares and the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) is now wholly owned by Daimler.[54]
Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains, which as of 2017, supplies engines to Force India[55] and Williams,[56] in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.
Bribery and corruption[edit]
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG's German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Daimler itself had to pay US$185 million as a settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.
Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler's compliance with anti-bribery laws.
U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.[57]
The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America.[58] Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units "continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials", though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.
In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler's strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.[citation needed]
According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious[according to whom?] dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, Ruhnama, translated into German.[59][60]
Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.[57]
U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. "In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe", the court papers said.[61]
Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a "long-standing practice" of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.
"Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business," said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department's criminal division.[62]
"It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice", Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.[63]
"We have learned a lot from past experience," Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.[this quote needs a citation]
As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business.[64] The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol "DAI" on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker's payments in countries around the globe.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a "just resolution".
The primary case is USA v. Daimler AG, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:10-cr-00063-RJL .[65][66]
Notes[edit]

^ Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG, the German car manufacturer created when DaimlerChrysler was split up. Jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the German company to use the Daimler brand as the title of a trading company, a trade name or a corporate name – rights that it did not hold previously. The renegotiated terms did not affect Jaguar's rights to build Daimler cars. A spokesman for Jaguar said: “The extended usage agreement does not affect either company's existing right to use the Daimler name for a product.” — The Times 28 July 2008.

History[edit]
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.
An Agreement of Mutual Interest was signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie (founded 1883 by Karl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach).
Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming Daimler-Benz AG—and agreed that, thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of Mercedes-Benz on their automobiles.
In 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced the world's largest cross-border deal ever, valued at US$38billion,[5] and the resulting change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG".
In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management (see below), the name[note 1] of the parent company was changed to simply "Daimler AG".
In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee.[6]

In a so-called "Merger of Equals," or "Marriage made in Heaven", according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp,[7] Daimler-Benz AG and United States-based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as Daimler-Benz AG bought 92% of Chrysler, and 8% of Chrysler remained independent[8] and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz's non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, "debis AG" for short, (created in 1989 to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group) to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. debis AG reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.[9][10]
The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005.[11] The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler, (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.[12]
Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.[13] As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
Sale of Chrysler[edit]
Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion.[citation needed] Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the smallest of the "Big 3" U.S. automakers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.
Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.[14]
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor,[15] but on 3 August 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.[16]
The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler's financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.
Since Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States, Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is, (as of 2016), still working to integrate Chrysler's products into the Fiat portfolio, such as Lancia and Chrysler's namesake brand, and Fiat's namesake brand with Dodge. Interestingly, despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the Daimler/Chrysler split, the fourth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee shares a platform with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class.[17] This also includes the Chrysler LX platform vehicles which initially used Mercedes-Benz components since its 2005 introduction.
Automated cars[edit]
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[18] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Management[edit]
Dieter Zetsche became the Chairman of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars after 1 January 2006 as well as member of the Board of Management since 1998. He was former President and CEO of the Chrysler, LLC (previously owned by Daimler AG); he may be best known in the United States as "Dr. Z" from a Chrysler advertising campaign called "Ask Dr. Z".[19]
Current (as of 10 February 2017) members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG are:

Dr. Dieter Zetsche: Chairman of the Board as well as Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.
Renata Jungo Brüngger: Integrity and Legal Affairs.

Wilfried Porth: Head of Human Resources and Labor Relations.
Hubertus Troska: Greater China.
Bodo Uebber: Head of Finance and Controlling as well as Financial Services.
Dr. Thomas Weber: Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.

The board of management total members of seven, after the unexpected resignation on 28 January 2014 of Andreas Renschler, former head of Manufacturing and Procurement Mercedes-Benz Cars & Mercedes-Benz Vans, had been brought back to eight after the nomination on 1 January 2015 of Swedish-born Ola Källenius to the board of management as head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. After the sudden departure of Wolfgang Bernhard in February 2017, that number returned to seven.
As of May 2015[update], the twenty members of Daimler AG's supervisory board are: Manfred Bischoff (Chairman), Michael Brecht (Deputy Chairman), Paul Achleitner, Sari Baldauf, Michael Bettag, Bernd Bohr, Clemens Börsig, Jürgen Hambrecht, Petraea Heynike, Andrea Jung, Joe Kaeser, Ergun Lümali, Sabine Maaßen, Wolfgang Nieke, Bernd Pischetsrieder, Valter Sanches, Jörg Spies, Elke Tönjes-Werner, Frank Weber, Roman Zitzelsberger.[21]

North Charleston expansion[edit]
On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. Currently,[when?] these vans are set up in Germany, then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001.[24]

Joint ventures and alliances[edit]
Beijing Automotive Group[edit]
In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC), becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.[31]
Daimler works with China's Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.[32]
Denza[edit]
In 2010 BYD Auto and Daimler AG created a new joint venture Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. In 2012 the new brand Denza was launched by the joint venture to specialise in electric cars.
Fujian Benz[edit]
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).
Renault-Nissan and Daimler Alliance[edit]
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dr. Dieter Zetsche announced a partnership between the three companies.[33] The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines)[34] and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.[35]
Alternative propulsion[edit]
Biofuel research[edit]
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.[36]
Electric[edit]
Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called "E-Mobility Berlin".[37]
Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009,[38][39] Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla's battery technology.[40] Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.[41] Daimler's joint venture with BYD[42] has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.
In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use.[43] Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology,[44][45] and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.[46]
Fuel cell[edit]
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus. In 2013, the Renault-Nissan/Daimler alliance was joined by Ford to further develop the fuel cell technology with an aim for production by 2017.[47][48]
Hybrid[edit]
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid.[49] and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trailed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.
Formula One[edit]
Main article: Mercedes-Benz in Formula One
On 16 November 2009, Daimler (45.1%) och Aabar Investments (30%) purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK, with Ross Brawn remaining team principal.,[50] However, the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler sold back its stake in McLaren in stages that ended in 2011.[51] Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2015, after which McLaren switched to engines from Honda.[52]
Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011.[53] In November 2012 Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares and the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) is now wholly owned by Daimler.[54]
Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains, which as of 2017, supplies engines to Force India[55] and Williams,[56] in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.
Bribery and corruption[edit]
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG's German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Daimler itself had to pay US$185 million as a settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.
Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler's compliance with anti-bribery laws.
U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.[57]
The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America.[58] Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units "continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials", though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.
In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler's strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.[citation needed]
According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious[according to whom?] dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, Ruhnama, translated into German.[59][60]
Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.[57]
U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. "In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe", the court papers said.[61]
Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a "long-standing practice" of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.
"Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business," said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department's criminal division.[62]
"It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice", Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.[63]
"We have learned a lot from past experience," Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.[this quote needs a citation]
As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business.[64] The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol "DAI" on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker's payments in countries around the globe.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a "just resolution".
The primary case is USA v. Daimler AG, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:10-cr-00063-RJL .[65][66]
Notes[edit]

^ Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG, the German car manufacturer created when DaimlerChrysler was split up. Jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the German company to use the Daimler brand as the title of a trading company, a trade name or a corporate name – rights that it did not hold previously. The renegotiated terms did not affect Jaguar's rights to build Daimler cars. A spokesman for Jaguar said: “The extended usage agreement does not affect either company's existing right to use the Daimler name for a product.” — The Times 28 July 2008.

History[edit]
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.
An Agreement of Mutual Interest was signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie (founded 1883 by Karl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach).
Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming Daimler-Benz AG—and agreed that, thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of Mercedes-Benz on their automobiles.
In 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced the world's largest cross-border deal ever, valued at US$38billion,[5] and the resulting change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG".
In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management (see below), the name[note 1] of the parent company was changed to simply "Daimler AG".
In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee.[6]

Merger with Chrysler[edit]




The former logo of Daimler Chrysler AG.


In a so-called "Merger of Equals," or "Marriage made in Heaven", according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp,[7] Daimler-Benz AG and United States-based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as Daimler-Benz AG bought 92% of Chrysler, and 8% of Chrysler remained independent[8] and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz's non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, "debis AG" for short, (created in 1989 to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group) to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. debis AG reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.[9][10]
The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005.[11] The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler, (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.[12]
Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.[13] As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
Sale of Chrysler[edit]
Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion.[citation needed] Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the smallest of the "Big 3" U.S. automakers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.
Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.[14]
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor,[15] but on 3 August 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.[16]
The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler's financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.
Since Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States, Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is, (as of 2016), still working to integrate Chrysler's products into the Fiat portfolio, such as Lancia and Chrysler's namesake brand, and Fiat's namesake brand with Dodge. Interestingly, despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the Daimler/Chrysler split, the fourth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee shares a platform with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class.[17] This also includes the Chrysler LX platform vehicles which initially used Mercedes-Benz components since its 2005 introduction.
Automated cars[edit]
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[18] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Management[edit]
Dieter Zetsche became the Chairman of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars after 1 January 2006 as well as member of the Board of Management since 1998. He was former President and CEO of the Chrysler, LLC (previously owned by Daimler AG); he may be best known in the United States as "Dr. Z" from a Chrysler advertising campaign called "Ask Dr. Z".[19]
Current (as of 10 February 2017) members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG are:

Dr. Dieter Zetsche: Chairman of the Board as well as Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.
Renata Jungo Brüngger: Integrity and Legal Affairs.
Ola Källenius: Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales.[20]
Wilfried Porth: Head of Human Resources and Labor Relations.
Hubertus Troska: Greater China.
Bodo Uebber: Head of Finance and Controlling as well as Financial Services.
Dr. Thomas Weber: Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.

The board of management total members of seven, after the unexpected resignation on 28 January 2014 of Andreas Renschler, former head of Manufacturing and Procurement Mercedes-Benz Cars & Mercedes-Benz Vans, had been brought back to eight after the nomination on 1 January 2015 of Swedish-born Ola Källenius to the board of management as head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. After the sudden departure of Wolfgang Bernhard in February 2017, that number returned to seven.
As of May 2015[update], the twenty members of Daimler AG's supervisory board are: Manfred Bischoff (Chairman), Michael Brecht (Deputy Chairman), Paul Achleitner, Sari Baldauf, Michael Bettag, Bernd Bohr, Clemens Börsig, Jürgen Hambrecht, Petraea Heynike, Andrea Jung, Joe Kaeser, Ergun Lümali, Sabine Maaßen, Wolfgang Nieke, Bernd Pischetsrieder, Valter Sanches, Jörg Spies, Elke Tönjes-Werner, Frank Weber, Roman Zitzelsberger.[21]

EADS shareholding[edit]

North Charleston expansion[edit]
On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. Currently,[when?] these vans are set up in Germany, then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001.[24]

50% Denza (Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd)
25% MV Agusta of Italy[29]
12% Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC)
11% KAMAZ of Russia
5% Aston Martin

At the end of 2011 McLaren Group completely bought back the stocks from Daimler.
17 April 2013, Daimler AG exits EADS,[30] the parent company of Airbus of Europe.
Joint ventures and alliances[edit]
Beijing Automotive Group[edit]
In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC), becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.[31]
Daimler works with China's Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.[32]
Denza[edit]
In 2010 BYD Auto and Daimler AG created a new joint venture Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. In 2012 the new brand Denza was launched by the joint venture to specialise in electric cars.
Fujian Benz[edit]
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).
Renault-Nissan and Daimler Alliance[edit]
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dr. Dieter Zetsche announced a partnership between the three companies.[33] The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines)[34] and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.[35]
Alternative propulsion[edit]
Biofuel research[edit]
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.[36]
Electric[edit]
Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called "E-Mobility Berlin".[37]
Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009,[38][39] Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla's battery technology.[40] Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.[41] Daimler's joint venture with BYD[42] has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.
In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use.[43] Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology,[44][45] and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.[46]
Fuel cell[edit]
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus. In 2013, the Renault-Nissan/Daimler alliance was joined by Ford to further develop the fuel cell technology with an aim for production by 2017.[47][48]
Hybrid[edit]
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid.[49] and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trailed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.
Formula One[edit]
Main article: Mercedes-Benz in Formula One
On 16 November 2009, Daimler (45.1%) och Aabar Investments (30%) purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK, with Ross Brawn remaining team principal.,[50] However, the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler sold back its stake in McLaren in stages that ended in 2011.[51] Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2015, after which McLaren switched to engines from Honda.[52]
Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011.[53] In November 2012 Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares and the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) is now wholly owned by Daimler.[54]
Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains, which as of 2017, supplies engines to Force India[55] and Williams,[56] in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.
Bribery and corruption[edit]
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG's German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Daimler itself had to pay US$185 million as a settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.
Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler's compliance with anti-bribery laws.
U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.[57]
The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America.[58] Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units "continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials", though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.
In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler's strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.[citation needed]
According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious[according to whom?] dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, Ruhnama, translated into German.[59][60]
Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.[57]
U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. "In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe", the court papers said.[61]
Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a "long-standing practice" of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.
"Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business," said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department's criminal division.[62]
"It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice", Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.[63]
"We have learned a lot from past experience," Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.[this quote needs a citation]
As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business.[64] The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol "DAI" on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker's payments in countries around the globe.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a "just resolution".
The primary case is USA v. Daimler AG, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:10-cr-00063-RJL .[65][66]
Notes[edit]

^ Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG, the German car manufacturer created when DaimlerChrysler was split up. Jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the German company to use the Daimler brand as the title of a trading company, a trade name or a corporate name – rights that it did not hold previously. The renegotiated terms did not affect Jaguar's rights to build Daimler cars. A spokesman for Jaguar said: “The extended usage agreement does not affect either company's existing right to use the Daimler name for a product.” — The Times 28 July 2008.

History[edit]
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.
An Agreement of Mutual Interest was signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie (founded 1883 by Karl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach).
Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming Daimler-Benz AG—and agreed that, thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of Mercedes-Benz on their automobiles.
In 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced the world's largest cross-border deal ever, valued at US$38billion,[5] and the resulting change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG".
In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management (see below), the name[note 1] of the parent company was changed to simply "Daimler AG".
In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee.[6]

Merger with Chrysler[edit]




The former logo of Daimler Chrysler AG.


In a so-called "Merger of Equals," or "Marriage made in Heaven", according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp,[7] Daimler-Benz AG and United States-based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as Daimler-Benz AG bought 92% of Chrysler, and 8% of Chrysler remained independent[8] and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz's non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, "debis AG" for short, (created in 1989 to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group) to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. debis AG reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.[9][10]
The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005.[11] The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler, (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.[12]
Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.[13] As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
Sale of Chrysler[edit]
Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion.[citation needed] Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the smallest of the "Big 3" U.S. automakers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.
Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.[14]
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor,[15] but on 3 August 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.[16]
The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler's financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.
Since Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States, Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is, (as of 2016), still working to integrate Chrysler's products into the Fiat portfolio, such as Lancia and Chrysler's namesake brand, and Fiat's namesake brand with Dodge. Interestingly, despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the Daimler/Chrysler split, the fourth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee shares a platform with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class.[17] This also includes the Chrysler LX platform vehicles which initially used Mercedes-Benz components since its 2005 introduction.
Automated cars[edit]
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[18] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Management[edit]
Dieter Zetsche became the Chairman of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars after 1 January 2006 as well as member of the Board of Management since 1998. He was former President and CEO of the Chrysler, LLC (previously owned by Daimler AG); he may be best known in the United States as "Dr. Z" from a Chrysler advertising campaign called "Ask Dr. Z".[19]
Current (as of 10 February 2017) members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG are:

Dr. Dieter Zetsche: Chairman of the Board as well as Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.
Renata Jungo Brüngger: Integrity and Legal Affairs.
Ola Källenius: Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales.[20]
Wilfried Porth: Head of Human Resources and Labor Relations.
Hubertus Troska: Greater China.
Bodo Uebber: Head of Finance and Controlling as well as Financial Services.
Dr. Thomas Weber: Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.

The board of management total members of seven, after the unexpected resignation on 28 January 2014 of Andreas Renschler, former head of Manufacturing and Procurement Mercedes-Benz Cars & Mercedes-Benz Vans, had been brought back to eight after the nomination on 1 January 2015 of Swedish-born Ola Källenius to the board of management as head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. After the sudden departure of Wolfgang Bernhard in February 2017, that number returned to seven.
As of May 2015[update], the twenty members of Daimler AG's supervisory board are: Manfred Bischoff (Chairman), Michael Brecht (Deputy Chairman), Paul Achleitner, Sari Baldauf, Michael Bettag, Bernd Bohr, Clemens Börsig, Jürgen Hambrecht, Petraea Heynike, Andrea Jung, Joe Kaeser, Ergun Lümali, Sabine Maaßen, Wolfgang Nieke, Bernd Pischetsrieder, Valter Sanches, Jörg Spies, Elke Tönjes-Werner, Frank Weber, Roman Zitzelsberger.[21]

North Charleston expansion[edit]
On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. Currently,[when?] these vans are set up in Germany, then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001.[24]

50% Denza (Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd)
25% MV Agusta of Italy[29]
12% Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC)
11% KAMAZ of Russia
5% Aston Martin

At the end of 2011 McLaren Group completely bought back the stocks from Daimler.
17 April 2013, Daimler AG exits EADS,[30] the parent company of Airbus of Europe.
Joint ventures and alliances[edit]
Beijing Automotive Group[edit]
In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC), becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.[31]
Daimler works with China's Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.[32]
Denza[edit]
In 2010 BYD Auto and Daimler AG created a new joint venture Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. In 2012 the new brand Denza was launched by the joint venture to specialise in electric cars.
Fujian Benz[edit]
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).
Renault-Nissan and Daimler Alliance[edit]
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dr. Dieter Zetsche announced a partnership between the three companies.[33] The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines)[34] and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.[35]
Alternative propulsion[edit]
Biofuel research[edit]
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.[36]
Electric[edit]
Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called "E-Mobility Berlin".[37]
Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009,[38][39] Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla's battery technology.[40] Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.[41] Daimler's joint venture with BYD[42] has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.
In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use.[43] Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology,[44][45] and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.[46]
Fuel cell[edit]
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus. In 2013, the Renault-Nissan/Daimler alliance was joined by Ford to further develop the fuel cell technology with an aim for production by 2017.[47][48]
Hybrid[edit]
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid.[49] and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trailed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.
Formula One[edit]
Main article: Mercedes-Benz in Formula One
On 16 November 2009, Daimler (45.1%) och Aabar Investments (30%) purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK, with Ross Brawn remaining team principal.,[50] However, the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler sold back its stake in McLaren in stages that ended in 2011.[51] Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2015, after which McLaren switched to engines from Honda.[52]
Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011.[53] In November 2012 Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares and the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) is now wholly owned by Daimler.[54]
Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains, which as of 2017, supplies engines to Force India[55] and Williams,[56] in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.
Bribery and corruption[edit]
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG's German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Daimler itself had to pay US$185 million as a settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.
Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler's compliance with anti-bribery laws.
U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.[57]
The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America.[58] Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units "continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials", though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.
In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler's strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.[citation needed]
According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious[according to whom?] dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, Ruhnama, translated into German.[59][60]
Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.[57]
U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. "In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe", the court papers said.[61]
Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a "long-standing practice" of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.
"Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business," said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department's criminal division.[62]
"It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice", Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.[63]
"We have learned a lot from past experience," Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.[this quote needs a citation]
As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business.[64] The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol "DAI" on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker's payments in countries around the globe.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a "just resolution".
The primary case is USA v. Daimler AG, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:10-cr-00063-RJL .[65][66]
Notes[edit]

^ Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG, the German car manufacturer created when DaimlerChrysler was split up. Jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the German company to use the Daimler brand as the title of a trading company, a trade name or a corporate name – rights that it did not hold previously. The renegotiated terms did not affect Jaguar's rights to build Daimler cars. A spokesman for Jaguar said: “The extended usage agreement does not affect either company's existing right to use the Daimler name for a product.” — The Times 28 July 2008.

History[edit]
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.
An Agreement of Mutual Interest was signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie (founded 1883 by Karl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach).
Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming Daimler-Benz AG—and agreed that, thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of Mercedes-Benz on their automobiles.
In 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced the world's largest cross-border deal ever, valued at US$38billion,[5] and the resulting change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG".
In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management (see below), the name[note 1] of the parent company was changed to simply "Daimler AG".
In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee.[6]

Merger with Chrysler[edit]




The former logo of Daimler Chrysler AG.


In a so-called "Merger of Equals," or "Marriage made in Heaven", according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp,[7] Daimler-Benz AG and United States-based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as Daimler-Benz AG bought 92% of Chrysler, and 8% of Chrysler remained independent[8] and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz's non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, "debis AG" for short, (created in 1989 to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group) to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. debis AG reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.[9][10]
The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005.[11] The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler, (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.[12]
Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.[13] As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
Sale of Chrysler[edit]
Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion.[citation needed] Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the smallest of the "Big 3" U.S. automakers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.
Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.[14]
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor,[15] but on 3 August 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.[16]
The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler's financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.
Since Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States, Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is, (as of 2016), still working to integrate Chrysler's products into the Fiat portfolio, such as Lancia and Chrysler's namesake brand, and Fiat's namesake brand with Dodge. Interestingly, despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the Daimler/Chrysler split, the fourth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee shares a platform with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class.[17] This also includes the Chrysler LX platform vehicles which initially used Mercedes-Benz components since its 2005 introduction.
Automated cars[edit]
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[18] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Management[edit]
Dieter Zetsche became the Chairman of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars after 1 January 2006 as well as member of the Board of Management since 1998. He was former President and CEO of the Chrysler, LLC (previously owned by Daimler AG); he may be best known in the United States as "Dr. Z" from a Chrysler advertising campaign called "Ask Dr. Z".[19]
Current (as of 10 February 2017) members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG are:

Dr. Dieter Zetsche: Chairman of the Board as well as Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.
Renata Jungo Brüngger: Integrity and Legal Affairs.
Ola Källenius: Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales.[20]
Wilfried Porth: Head of Human Resources and Labor Relations.
Hubertus Troska: Greater China.
Bodo Uebber: Head of Finance and Controlling as well as Financial Services.
Dr. Thomas Weber: Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.

The board of management total members of seven, after the unexpected resignation on 28 January 2014 of Andreas Renschler, former head of Manufacturing and Procurement Mercedes-Benz Cars & Mercedes-Benz Vans, had been brought back to eight after the nomination on 1 January 2015 of Swedish-born Ola Källenius to the board of management as head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. After the sudden departure of Wolfgang Bernhard in February 2017, that number returned to seven.
As of May 2015[update], the twenty members of Daimler AG's supervisory board are: Manfred Bischoff (Chairman), Michael Brecht (Deputy Chairman), Paul Achleitner, Sari Baldauf, Michael Bettag, Bernd Bohr, Clemens Börsig, Jürgen Hambrecht, Petraea Heynike, Andrea Jung, Joe Kaeser, Ergun Lümali, Sabine Maaßen, Wolfgang Nieke, Bernd Pischetsrieder, Valter Sanches, Jörg Spies, Elke Tönjes-Werner, Frank Weber, Roman Zitzelsberger.[21]

North Charleston expansion[edit]
On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. Currently,[when?] these vans are set up in Germany, then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001.[24]

Joint ventures and alliances[edit]
Beijing Automotive Group[edit]
In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC), becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.[31]
Daimler works with China's Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.[32]
Denza[edit]
In 2010 BYD Auto and Daimler AG created a new joint venture Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. In 2012 the new brand Denza was launched by the joint venture to specialise in electric cars.
Fujian Benz[edit]
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).
Renault-Nissan and Daimler Alliance[edit]
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dr. Dieter Zetsche announced a partnership between the three companies.[33] The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines)[34] and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.[35]
Alternative propulsion[edit]
Biofuel research[edit]
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.[36]
Electric[edit]
Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called "E-Mobility Berlin".[37]
Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009,[38][39] Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla's battery technology.[40] Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.[41] Daimler's joint venture with BYD[42] has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.
In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use.[43] Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology,[44][45] and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.[46]
Fuel cell[edit]
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus. In 2013, the Renault-Nissan/Daimler alliance was joined by Ford to further develop the fuel cell technology with an aim for production by 2017.[47][48]
Hybrid[edit]
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid.[49] and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trailed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.
Formula One[edit]
Main article: Mercedes-Benz in Formula One
On 16 November 2009, Daimler (45.1%) och Aabar Investments (30%) purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK, with Ross Brawn remaining team principal.,[50] However, the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler sold back its stake in McLaren in stages that ended in 2011.[51] Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2015, after which McLaren switched to engines from Honda.[52]
Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011.[53] In November 2012 Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares and the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) is now wholly owned by Daimler.[54]
Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains, which as of 2017, supplies engines to Force India[55] and Williams,[56] in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.
Bribery and corruption[edit]
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG's German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Daimler itself had to pay US$185 million as a settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.
Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler's compliance with anti-bribery laws.
U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.[57]
The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America.[58] Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units "continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials", though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.
In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler's strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.[citation needed]
According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious[according to whom?] dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, Ruhnama, translated into German.[59][60]
Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.[57]
U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. "In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe", the court papers said.[61]
Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a "long-standing practice" of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.
"Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business," said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department's criminal division.[62]
"It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice", Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.[63]
"We have learned a lot from past experience," Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.[this quote needs a citation]
As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business.[64] The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol "DAI" on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker's payments in countries around the globe.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a "just resolution".
The primary case is USA v. Daimler AG, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:10-cr-00063-RJL .[65][66]
Notes[edit]

^ Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG, the German car manufacturer created when DaimlerChrysler was split up. Jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the German company to use the Daimler brand as the title of a trading company, a trade name or a corporate name – rights that it did not hold previously. The renegotiated terms did not affect Jaguar's rights to build Daimler cars. A spokesman for Jaguar said: “The extended usage agreement does not affect either company's existing right to use the Daimler name for a product.” — The Times 28 July 2008.

        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREIt will likely become the coolest new pickup truck that Americans won't ever be allowed to buy – the Mercedes-Benz X-Class.Daimler, parent of Mercedes-Benz, says it is bringing the latest concept version of its first pickup to the Geneva Motor Show later this month as a luxury midsize model.When it hits showrooms later this year, X-Class will be sold in what Mercedes says are a bunch of "key markets," and the U.S. isn't included (for the moment). They are Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Australia with New Zealand and Europe."With the Mercedes-Benz pickup, we will close one of the last gaps in our portfolio," said Dieter Zetsche, Daimler's chairman and head of Mercedes-Benz Cars. "The X-Class will set new standards in a growing segment."The concept version being shown in Geneva will be more upscale than the one seen last year at an event in Sweden. It will be made at Nissan and Renault plants under an agreement that Mercedes-Benz has hammered out.If it were to come to the U.S., it would be unique. There are no luxury brands among major pickup truck models. Instead, Detroit's Big 3 automakers, plus Nissan and Toyota, make premium versions of their full-size trucks. Plus, the market for midsize trucks is dwarfed by demand for the bigger ones. There were 2.2 million full-size pickups sold last year, compared to about 450,000 that fall into the midsize category, Autodata reports.There's a reasonable chance that the truck will come to the U.S. if midsize pickups continue to make gains, says Mark Williams, editor of PickupTrucks.com. "It would make sense to be (in the U.S.) if the market keeps on its steady growth," Williams said.Mercedes is promising that X-Class won't be dainty. It will have underbody guards to protect components from rocky terrain, an electric winch for pulling the truck out of trouble and 22-inch wheels for extra ground clearance. The brand says the one-ton pickup will have seating for five.

Electrifying the product portfolio.7. July 2016InnovationPhoto: Daimler Text: Walther Wuttke  “We will be electrifying all Mercedes-Benz model series”: Thomas Weber, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG responsible for Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development



                        Thomas Weber has been in charge of Group Research at Daimler AG and the development of Mercedes-Benz Cars for over twelve years. In this role he is involved in the most extensive process of technological modification undergone by the motor car since it was invented 130 years ago. He explained which technologies and models the company will be using to face this challenge at the Mercedes-Benz “Road to the Future” TecDay in Stuttgart at the start of June.


                    








MR WEBER, THE GERMAN AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY IS OFTEN ACCUSED OF HAVING WAITED TOO LONG TO DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE DRIVE SYSTEMS. WHAT’S YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS CRITICISM?
Thomas Weber: We have a completely different view because for years at Daimler we’ve been spending a lot of money on alternative drive systems and will continue to step up investment in this area. For example, over the next two years alone we will be spending 14.5 billion euros on research and development. Furthermore, around half of this goes into “green” technologies. At Mercedes-Benz Cars 5.4 billion euros will be invested during each of the next two years. We are therefore well prepared for the coming changes, alert and very active.

HOW ARE YOU AIMING TO WIN OVER CUSTOMERS FOR YOUR NEW ELECTRIC VEHICLES?
If the new electric vehicles are to leave their niche, then they need to be exceptionally attractive to customers: that means being suitable for everyday use, environmentally compatible and offering a large portion of driving enjoyment. And obviously the price needs to be right, too. At the same time, it is imperative that the appropriate infrastructure is also put in place. This includes charging stations as well as hydrogen filling stations for our fuel cell models. The acquisition premium for environmentally friendly cars can help in this respect. Incidentally, the fact that the industry is bearing half of these expenses is unique worldwide.

For a long time it has also been clear that vehicles with alternative drive systems will become a familiar sight on our roads at some point. We at Daimler strongly believe that. Which is why we’ve been working on suitable solutions for many years and not just on ones for cars.

WHAT ROLE DO ALTERNATIVE DRIVE SYSTEMS PLAY WITHIN THE CURRENT MODEL RANGE?
We believe that there is no other manufacturer with a comparable portfolio of electric vehicles and solutions addressing aspects of electric mobility on the road. Our range extends from the smart city runabout and the electric B-Class through to commercial vehicles such as the electrically powered Canter from our Fuso brand. Over the coming months we will be “fitting” some more important new products and features into the model range. There is a lot of dynamic activity going on!


 Well prepared for the coming changes and alert.

GIVEN THE VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE POWERTRAIN SYSTEMS SUCH AS PURELY ELECTRIC, HYBRID, PLUG-IN HYBRID AND UPGRADING CONVENTIONAL ENGINES, THE QUESTION IS WHICH ONE IS THE ROUTE TO THE FUTURE. WHICH ROUTE IS DAIMLER TAKING?
Some time ago we decided on a three-lane approach and are focusing on tailor-made solutions in order to cover all future mobility scenarios. For that reason we are also keeping different technology options open. For one thing, we are using all the potential to further develop and optimise our high-tech engines. Secondly, we are focusing on highly systematic hybridisation of the model range to increase efficiency further. And thirdly, we are continuing to work on locally emission-free vehicles with battery and fuel cell drive system.

WHAT FUTURE DOES THE HYBRID DRIVE HAVE AT MERCEDES?
A bright one. We have announced that we are putting ten plug-in hybrid models on the road by 2017. Eight of them have already been launched and the two others will follow in the coming year. What we have achieved in this respect is clear to see. The plug-in hybrid is where our customers start to enter local emission-free driving.

Today the S-Class has an electric range of some 30 kilometres. Next year, as part of the facelift, we will attain a range of 50 kilometres for the first time. We are anticipating further leaps in range by the year 2020 thanks to the continued evolution of lithium-ion batteries.


' You'll be able to travel up to 500 kilometres on a single battery charge. '







LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES ARE PRESENTLY PLAYING THE LEADING ROLE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WHAT COMES AFTER THIS TECHNOLOGY?
We are already concerning ourselves with the “post-lithium-ion generation”, which in our estimation can be deployable by 2025 at the latest. Consequently we are able to speak of considerable leaps in range. We are then talking about distances significantly greater than the ones we are familiar with from today’s electric vehicles.

One thing is clear: the plug-in hybrid combines the best of both worlds. In everyday life, it is possible to complete most journeys with zero emissions if the vehicle is charged on a regular basis. Customers will also appreciate that the dynamism of the driving experience in future will come from the electric motor because it provides full torque right from a standing start. The combustion engine then steps in over longer distances.

WHAT NEW PRODUCTS AND FEATURES CAN WE EXPECT FOR PURELY ELECTRIC VEHICLES?
In 2010 we were the first German manufacturer to bring a vehicle with an electric drive system – the smart – to market. The smart is still the most successful electric model on the German market. In addition, the electric B-Class delivers electric mobility for families and we also have a broad offering for commercial vehicles.

We will carry on pursuing our initiative in future and will be bringing the fourth generation of the smart to market at the end of the year in its two- and four-seater versions with electric drive system. At Mercedes we are laying the foundation for our future electric strategy in the form of a large electric vehicle. We will be presenting a definite perspective on this new vehicle with a 500-kilometre range at the Paris Motor Show in the autumn. We are embedding the components for all electric vehicles, including fuel cell and hybrid models, into a new, shared Mercedes-Benz electric modular system. The structure and also the electric architecture are in place and the components themselves are already fully in development.

In any case, the batteries will continue to be provided by our factory in Kamenz, which is in the process of being extended. Our ACCUmotive subsidiary in future will supply the batteries for all electric models. In future we will be electrifying all Mercedes-Benz model series.


' We are already working on the post-lithium generation, which can be deployed by 2025. '







THE NEXT STEP ON FROM ELECTRIC BATTERY-POWERED TECHNOLOGY IS THE FUEL CELL. HOW FAR HAS DEVELOPMENT ADVANCED HERE?
We have been working on fuel cell technology for 20 years. To date our test vehicles, the B-Class F-CELL and the Citaro FuelCell Hybrid urban bus, have jointly completed around twelve million kilometres in testing. This technology works and the short filling time of less than three minutes is the fuel cell’s big advantage. The next generation is about to launch and thanks to the many improvements – for instance, by using up 90 percent less platinum – we have also been able to lower costs considerably.

In the coming year we will be unveiling our first series-production car featuring this new fuel cell technology. It will be based on the GLC and, in a world first, be brought to market featuring plug-in hybrid technology. This is how we are merging the advantages of the two technologies. In other words, the fuel cell gets a plug. The battery is designed for a range of approximately 50 kilometres and altogether the vehicle can achieve an electric range of up to 500 kilometres in the NEDC thanks to sophisticated energy management.

On the commercial vehicle side, the world’s most successful urban bus, the Citaro, will be available on the market with fuel cell and battery from 2018.


 20 years of experience with the fuel cell. 







WHAT ROLE WILL THE COMBUSTION ENGINE PLAY IN FUTURE? DOES IT EVEN STILL HAVE A FUTURE?
Over the past 20 years we have halved the average consumption of our car fleet. This major progress would never have been achieved without the diesel drive system. We see plenty of potential for this drive system into the future. Our new OM 654 diesel engine likewise corroborates this, having reduced consumption by another 13 percent. Some variants weigh 30 or even 40 kilograms less than its predecessor. During development, the main priority was delivering a very significant reduction in NOx emissions.

The new drive system is the first of its kind to already meet the highly demanding RDE regulations that will apply from September 2017. We had the engine inspected by independent testers at DEKRA who have confirmed our data. The results are accessible to all. This high-tech diesel drive system generation will be rolled out in all Mercedes models over the next three years.

AND HOW WILL THE PETROL ENGINE FARE?
Next year we will be launching the new generation of our petrol engines. We are introducing a 48-volt on-board electrical system. The boundaries compared to a hybrid vehicle are therefore blurring. With this system it is possible to optimise efficiency further thanks to recuperating braking energy, while at the same time experiencing major gains in comfort.

In this way we will electrify all passenger car model series from Mercedes-Benz step by step. These models will increasingly transition into high-tech cars. What’s more, we’re the first manufacturer in the world to equip our petrol engines with a petrol particulate filter. In future we will also do everything we can to further optimise the efficiency of our drive systems – including for commercial vehicles – alongside the highest standards of environmental compatibility.


' We will electrify all passenger car model series from Mercedes-Benz step by step. '

History[edit]
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.
An Agreement of Mutual Interest was signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie (founded 1883 by Karl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach).
Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming Daimler-Benz AG—and agreed that, thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of Mercedes-Benz on their automobiles.
In 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced the world's largest cross-border deal ever, valued at US$38billion,[5] and the resulting change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG".
In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management (see below), the name[note 1] of the parent company was changed to simply "Daimler AG".
In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee.[6]

Merger with Chrysler[edit]




The former logo of Daimler Chrysler AG.


In a so-called "Merger of Equals," or "Marriage made in Heaven", according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp,[7] Daimler-Benz AG and United States-based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as Daimler-Benz AG bought 92% of Chrysler, and 8% of Chrysler remained independent[8] and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz's non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, "debis AG" for short, (created in 1989 to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group) to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. debis AG reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.[9][10]
The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005.[11] The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler, (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.[12]
Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.[13] As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.

Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion.[citation needed] Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the smallest of the "Big 3" U.S. automakers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.
Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.[14]
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor,[15] but on 3 August 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.[16]
The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler's financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.
Since Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States, Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is, (as of 2016), still working to integrate Chrysler's products into the Fiat portfolio, such as Lancia and Chrysler's namesake brand, and Fiat's namesake brand with Dodge. Interestingly, despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the Daimler/Chrysler split, the fourth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee shares a platform with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class.[17] This also includes the Chrysler LX platform vehicles which initially used Mercedes-Benz components since its 2005 introduction.
Automated cars[edit]
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[18] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Management[edit]
Dieter Zetsche became the Chairman of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars after 1 January 2006 as well as member of the Board of Management since 1998. He was former President and CEO of the Chrysler, LLC (previously owned by Daimler AG); he may be best known in the United States as "Dr. Z" from a Chrysler advertising campaign called "Ask Dr. Z".[19]
Current (as of 10 February 2017) members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG are:

Dr. Dieter Zetsche: Chairman of the Board as well as Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.

North Charleston expansion[edit]
On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. Currently,[when?] these vans are set up in Germany, then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001.[24]

25% MV Agusta of Italy[29]
12% Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC)
11% KAMAZ of Russia
5% Aston Martin

At the end of 2011 McLaren Group completely bought back the stocks from Daimler.
17 April 2013, Daimler AG exits EADS,[30] the parent company of Airbus of Europe.
Joint ventures and alliances[edit]
Beijing Automotive Group[edit]
In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC), becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.[31]
Daimler works with China's Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.[32]
Denza[edit]
In 2010 BYD Auto and Daimler AG created a new joint venture Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. In 2012 the new brand Denza was launched by the joint venture to specialise in electric cars.
Fujian Benz[edit]
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).
Renault-Nissan and Daimler Alliance[edit]
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dr. Dieter Zetsche announced a partnership between the three companies.[33] The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines)[34] and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.[35]
Alternative propulsion[edit]
Biofuel research[edit]
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.[36]
Electric[edit]
Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called "E-Mobility Berlin".[37]
Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009,[38][39] Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla's battery technology.[40] Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.[41] Daimler's joint venture with BYD[42] has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.
In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use.[43] Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology,[44][45] and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.[46]
Fuel cell[edit]
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus. In 2013, the Renault-Nissan/Daimler alliance was joined by Ford to further develop the fuel cell technology with an aim for production by 2017.[47][48]
Hybrid[edit]
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid.[49] and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trailed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.
Formula One[edit]
Main article: Mercedes-Benz in Formula One
On 16 November 2009, Daimler (45.1%) och Aabar Investments (30%) purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK, with Ross Brawn remaining team principal.,[50] However, the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler sold back its stake in McLaren in stages that ended in 2011.[51] Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2015, after which McLaren switched to engines from Honda.[52]
Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011.[53] In November 2012 Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares and the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) is now wholly owned by Daimler.[54]
Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains, which as of 2017, supplies engines to Force India[55] and Williams,[56] in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.
Bribery and corruption[edit]
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG's German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Daimler itself had to pay US$185 million as a settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.
Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler's compliance with anti-bribery laws.
U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.[57]
The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America.[58] Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units "continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials", though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.
In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler's strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.[citation needed]
According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious[according to whom?] dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, Ruhnama, translated into German.[59][60]
Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.[57]
U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. "In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe", the court papers said.[61]
Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a "long-standing practice" of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.
"Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business," said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department's criminal division.[62]
"It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice", Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.[63]
"We have learned a lot from past experience," Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.[this quote needs a citation]
As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business.[64] The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol "DAI" on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker's payments in countries around the globe.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a "just resolution".
The primary case is USA v. Daimler AG, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:10-cr-00063-RJL .[65][66]
Notes[edit]

^ Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG, the German car manufacturer created when DaimlerChrysler was split up. Jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the German company to use the Daimler brand as the title of a trading company, a trade name or a corporate name – rights that it did not hold previously. The renegotiated terms did not affect Jaguar's rights to build Daimler cars. A spokesman for Jaguar said: “The extended usage agreement does not affect either company's existing right to use the Daimler name for a product.” — The Times 28 July 2008.

History[edit]
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.
An Agreement of Mutual Interest was signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie (founded 1883 by Karl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach).
Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming Daimler-Benz AG—and agreed that, thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of Mercedes-Benz on their automobiles.
In 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced the world's largest cross-border deal ever, valued at US$38billion,[5] and the resulting change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG".
In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management (see below), the name[note 1] of the parent company was changed to simply "Daimler AG".
In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee.[6]

Merger with Chrysler[edit]




The former logo of Daimler Chrysler AG.


In a so-called "Merger of Equals," or "Marriage made in Heaven", according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp,[7] Daimler-Benz AG and United States-based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as Daimler-Benz AG bought 92% of Chrysler, and 8% of Chrysler remained independent[8] and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz's non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, "debis AG" for short, (created in 1989 to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group) to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. debis AG reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.[9][10]
The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005.[11] The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler, (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.[12]
Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.[13] As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.

Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion.[citation needed] Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the smallest of the "Big 3" U.S. automakers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.
Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.[14]
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor,[15] but on 3 August 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.[16]
The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler's financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.
Since Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States, Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is, (as of 2016), still working to integrate Chrysler's products into the Fiat portfolio, such as Lancia and Chrysler's namesake brand, and Fiat's namesake brand with Dodge. Interestingly, despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the Daimler/Chrysler split, the fourth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee shares a platform with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class.[17] This also includes the Chrysler LX platform vehicles which initially used Mercedes-Benz components since its 2005 introduction.
Automated cars[edit]
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[18] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Management[edit]
Dieter Zetsche became the Chairman of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars after 1 January 2006 as well as member of the Board of Management since 1998. He was former President and CEO of the Chrysler, LLC (previously owned by Daimler AG); he may be best known in the United States as "Dr. Z" from a Chrysler advertising campaign called "Ask Dr. Z".[19]
Current (as of 10 February 2017) members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG are:

Dr. Dieter Zetsche: Chairman of the Board as well as Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.

North Charleston expansion[edit]
On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. Currently,[when?] these vans are set up in Germany, then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001.[24]

25% MV Agusta of Italy[29]
12% Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC)
11% KAMAZ of Russia
5% Aston Martin

At the end of 2011 McLaren Group completely bought back the stocks from Daimler.
17 April 2013, Daimler AG exits EADS,[30] the parent company of Airbus of Europe.
Joint ventures and alliances[edit]
Beijing Automotive Group[edit]
In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC), becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.[31]
Daimler works with China's Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.[32]
Denza[edit]
In 2010 BYD Auto and Daimler AG created a new joint venture Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. In 2012 the new brand Denza was launched by the joint venture to specialise in electric cars.
Fujian Benz[edit]
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).
Renault-Nissan and Daimler Alliance[edit]
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dr. Dieter Zetsche announced a partnership between the three companies.[33] The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines)[34] and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.[35]
Alternative propulsion[edit]
Biofuel research[edit]
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.[36]
Electric[edit]
Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called "E-Mobility Berlin".[37]
Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009,[38][39] Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla's battery technology.[40] Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.[41] Daimler's joint venture with BYD[42] has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.
In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use.[43] Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology,[44][45] and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.[46]
Fuel cell[edit]
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus. In 2013, the Renault-Nissan/Daimler alliance was joined by Ford to further develop the fuel cell technology with an aim for production by 2017.[47][48]
Hybrid[edit]
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid.[49] and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trailed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.
Formula One[edit]
Main article: Mercedes-Benz in Formula One
On 16 November 2009, Daimler (45.1%) och Aabar Investments (30%) purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK, with Ross Brawn remaining team principal.,[50] However, the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler sold back its stake in McLaren in stages that ended in 2011.[51] Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2015, after which McLaren switched to engines from Honda.[52]
Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011.[53] In November 2012 Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares and the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) is now wholly owned by Daimler.[54]
Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains, which as of 2017, supplies engines to Force India[55] and Williams,[56] in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.
Bribery and corruption[edit]
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG's German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Daimler itself had to pay US$185 million as a settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.
Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler's compliance with anti-bribery laws.
U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.[57]
The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America.[58] Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units "continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials", though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.
In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler's strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.[citation needed]
According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious[according to whom?] dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, Ruhnama, translated into German.[59][60]
Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.[57]
U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. "In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe", the court papers said.[61]
Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a "long-standing practice" of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.
"Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business," said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department's criminal division.[62]
"It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice", Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.[63]
"We have learned a lot from past experience," Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.[this quote needs a citation]
As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business.[64] The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol "DAI" on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker's payments in countries around the globe.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a "just resolution".
The primary case is USA v. Daimler AG, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:10-cr-00063-RJL .[65][66]
Notes[edit]

^ Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG, the German car manufacturer created when DaimlerChrysler was split up. Jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the German company to use the Daimler brand as the title of a trading company, a trade name or a corporate name – rights that it did not hold previously. The renegotiated terms did not affect Jaguar's rights to build Daimler cars. A spokesman for Jaguar said: “The extended usage agreement does not affect either company's existing right to use the Daimler name for a product.” — The Times 28 July 2008.

History[edit]
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.
An Agreement of Mutual Interest was signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie (founded 1883 by Karl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach).
Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming Daimler-Benz AG—and agreed that, thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of Mercedes-Benz on their automobiles.
In 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced the world's largest cross-border deal ever, valued at US$38billion,[5] and the resulting change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG".
In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management (see below), the name[note 1] of the parent company was changed to simply "Daimler AG".
In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee.[6]

Merger with Chrysler[edit]




The former logo of Daimler Chrysler AG.


In a so-called "Merger of Equals," or "Marriage made in Heaven", according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp,[7] Daimler-Benz AG and United States-based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as Daimler-Benz AG bought 92% of Chrysler, and 8% of Chrysler remained independent[8] and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz's non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, "debis AG" for short, (created in 1989 to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group) to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. debis AG reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.[9][10]
The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005.[11] The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler, (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.[12]
Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.[13] As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
Sale of Chrysler[edit]
Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion.[citation needed] Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the smallest of the "Big 3" U.S. automakers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.
Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.[14]
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor,[15] but on 3 August 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.[16]
The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler's financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.
Since Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States, Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is, (as of 2016), still working to integrate Chrysler's products into the Fiat portfolio, such as Lancia and Chrysler's namesake brand, and Fiat's namesake brand with Dodge. Interestingly, despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the Daimler/Chrysler split, the fourth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee shares a platform with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class.[17] This also includes the Chrysler LX platform vehicles which initially used Mercedes-Benz components since its 2005 introduction.
Automated cars[edit]
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[18] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Management[edit]
Dieter Zetsche became the Chairman of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars after 1 January 2006 as well as member of the Board of Management since 1998. He was former President and CEO of the Chrysler, LLC (previously owned by Daimler AG); he may be best known in the United States as "Dr. Z" from a Chrysler advertising campaign called "Ask Dr. Z".[19]
Current (as of 10 February 2017) members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG are:

Dr. Dieter Zetsche: Chairman of the Board as well as Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.
Renata Jungo Brüngger: Integrity and Legal Affairs.
Ola Källenius: Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales.[20]
Wilfried Porth: Head of Human Resources and Labor Relations.
Hubertus Troska: Greater China.
Bodo Uebber: Head of Finance and Controlling as well as Financial Services.
Dr. Thomas Weber: Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.

The board of management total members of seven, after the unexpected resignation on 28 January 2014 of Andreas Renschler, former head of Manufacturing and Procurement Mercedes-Benz Cars & Mercedes-Benz Vans, had been brought back to eight after the nomination on 1 January 2015 of Swedish-born Ola Källenius to the board of management as head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. After the sudden departure of Wolfgang Bernhard in February 2017, that number returned to seven.
As of May 2015[update], the twenty members of Daimler AG's supervisory board are: Manfred Bischoff (Chairman), Michael Brecht (Deputy Chairman), Paul Achleitner, Sari Baldauf, Michael Bettag, Bernd Bohr, Clemens Börsig, Jürgen Hambrecht, Petraea Heynike, Andrea Jung, Joe Kaeser, Ergun Lümali, Sabine Maaßen, Wolfgang Nieke, Bernd Pischetsrieder, Valter Sanches, Jörg Spies, Elke Tönjes-Werner, Frank Weber, Roman Zitzelsberger.[21]

Institutional investors: 70.6%
Private investors: 19.5
Kuwait Investment Authority (Kuwait): 6.8%
Renault (France): 1.54%
Nissan (Japan): 1.54%

by region[3] 29.2% Europe (excluding Germany), 36.4% German, 24.3% United States, 6.8% Kuwait, 2.9% Asia, 0.4% Others.
EADS shareholding[edit]
As of March 2010, Daimler owned a 22.5% share of EADS, of which the public sector held 40%.[22]
In April 2013, Daimler sold its shares in EADS,[23] and the same year, EADS restructured itself into a new aerospace company named Airbus, into which Daimler AG has no shareholding.

On the side of the public sector, the KfW banking group holds 13%, HGV Hamburger Gesellschaft für Vermögens- und Beteiligungsverwaltung (State of Hamburg) holds 10%, Hannoversche Beteiligungsgesellschaft (State of Lower Saxony) holds 5%, Bayerische Landesbodenkreditanstalt, Anstalt der Bayerischen Landesbank holds 3.5%, LfA Förderbank Bayern holds 1.5%, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg and Landeskreditbank Baden-Württemberg – Förderbank (L-Bank) each holds 2.5%, and Bremer Investitions-Gesellschaft (State of Bremen) holds 2%.

North Charleston expansion[edit]
On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. Currently,[when?] these vans are set up in Germany, then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001.[24]

50% Denza (Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd)
25% MV Agusta of Italy[29]
12% Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC)
11% KAMAZ of Russia
5% Aston Martin

At the end of 2011 McLaren Group completely bought back the stocks from Daimler.
17 April 2013, Daimler AG exits EADS,[30] the parent company of Airbus of Europe.
Joint ventures and alliances[edit]
Beijing Automotive Group[edit]
In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC), becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.[31]
Daimler works with China's Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.[32]
Denza[edit]
In 2010 BYD Auto and Daimler AG created a new joint venture Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. In 2012 the new brand Denza was launched by the joint venture to specialise in electric cars.
Fujian Benz[edit]
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).
Renault-Nissan and Daimler Alliance[edit]
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dr. Dieter Zetsche announced a partnership between the three companies.[33] The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines)[34] and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.[35]
Alternative propulsion[edit]
Biofuel research[edit]
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.[36]
Electric[edit]
Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called "E-Mobility Berlin".[37]
Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009,[38][39] Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla's battery technology.[40] Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.[41] Daimler's joint venture with BYD[42] has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.
In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use.[43] Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology,[44][45] and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.[46]
Fuel cell[edit]
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus. In 2013, the Renault-Nissan/Daimler alliance was joined by Ford to further develop the fuel cell technology with an aim for production by 2017.[47][48]
Hybrid[edit]
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid.[49] and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trailed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.
Formula One[edit]
Main article: Mercedes-Benz in Formula One
On 16 November 2009, Daimler (45.1%) och Aabar Investments (30%) purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK, with Ross Brawn remaining team principal.,[50] However, the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler sold back its stake in McLaren in stages that ended in 2011.[51] Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2015, after which McLaren switched to engines from Honda.[52]
Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011.[53] In November 2012 Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares and the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) is now wholly owned by Daimler.[54]
Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains, which as of 2017, supplies engines to Force India[55] and Williams,[56] in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.
Bribery and corruption[edit]
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG's German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Daimler itself had to pay US$185 million as a settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.
Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler's compliance with anti-bribery laws.
U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.[57]
The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America.[58] Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units "continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials", though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.
In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler's strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.[citation needed]
According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious[according to whom?] dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, Ruhnama, translated into German.[59][60]
Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.[57]
U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. "In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe", the court papers said.[61]
Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a "long-standing practice" of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.
"Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business," said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department's criminal division.[62]
"It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice", Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.[63]
"We have learned a lot from past experience," Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.[this quote needs a citation]
As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business.[64] The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol "DAI" on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker's payments in countries around the globe.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a "just resolution".
The primary case is USA v. Daimler AG, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:10-cr-00063-RJL .[65][66]
Notes[edit]

^ Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG, the German car manufacturer created when DaimlerChrysler was split up. Jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the German company to use the Daimler brand as the title of a trading company, a trade name or a corporate name – rights that it did not hold previously. The renegotiated terms did not affect Jaguar's rights to build Daimler cars. A spokesman for Jaguar said: “The extended usage agreement does not affect either company's existing right to use the Daimler name for a product.” — The Times 28 July 2008.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
