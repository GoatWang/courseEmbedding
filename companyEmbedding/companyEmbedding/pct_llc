What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

PCT, LLC, A Caladrius Company, to Manufacture EU-Compliant Cell Therapy Product for IRX Therapeutics, Inc. From Its New Jersey Facility


September 8, 2015    				   	












PCT, LLC, A Caladrius Company (PCT), the manufacturing sciences and technical operations subsidiary of cell therapy leader Caladrius Biosciences (NASDAQ:CLBS) and leading external manufacturing partner to the cell therapy industry, announced today that it will expand its current manufacturing capacity at PCT’s Allendale, New Jersey facility to support IRX Therapeutics, Inc. (IRX)’s anticipated clinical trial manufacturing needs for the INSPIRE Phase 2b study in head and neck cancer patients. PCT will provide IRX with personnel and dedicated clean room capacity within its current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) infrastructure and, subsequently, pursuant to European Union (EU) cell therapy manufacturing standards.
PCT has been providing manufacturing services since 2008 to support IRX’s development of IRX-2, a primary cell-derived biologic with multiple active cytokine components. IRX-2 is a cancer therapeutic designed by IRX to activate a patient’s immune system by unlocking the power of immunotherapy to restore immunity and overcome cancer-induced immune suppression. IRX-2 is in late-stage development in a neo-adjuvant regimen for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
The expanded arrangement includes IRX’s use of PCT’s ISO Class 6/Class 1,000 clean room system, enabling manufacture of cell-based products that can then be shipped to Europe and, when approved, commercially distributed on the EU market.
“We are pleased to expand our relationship with IRX to manufacture their cell therapy product to EU standards from one of our US locations. The versatility of our operations and our understanding of global regulatory processes provides cell therapy developers like IRX with a distinct advantage as they advance toward commercialization and render PCT the manufacturing partner of choice,” said Robert A. Preti, PhD, President of PCT, and Senior Vice President, Development and Technical Operations and Chief Technology Officer of Caladrius Biosciences.
“We are excited to both continue and expand our manufacturing partnership with PCT. With the critical support of PCT’s unique expertise and capabilities, we look forward to advancing the clinical and commercial development for our important and promising IRX-2 clinical development program,” said Jeffrey Hwang, President and COO, IRX Therapeutics.
About IRX Therapeutics
IRX Therapeutics is a privately held company that develops immune therapies to treat cancer and related diseases. The company’s therapies are designed to target and restore the immune system in order to improve a patient’s response to next-generation cancer vaccines and novel targeted therapeutics. IRX Therapeutics was founded by John W. Hadden, M.D., a pioneer in the field of Immunopharmacology. The company’s product platform under development, which is based on over 30 years of research by Dr. Hadden, seeks to restore the immune system of cancer patients, which is suppressed by the onset of the disease. http://www.irxtherapeutics.com/

Caladrius Biosciences Subsidiary PCT, LLC Enters Into Global Collaboration and License Agreement with Hitachi Chemical


March 14, 2016    				   	













Caladrius Sells 19.9% equity stake in PCT for $19.4 million
Licenses cell therapy technology for certain Asian territories for $5.6 million and future royalties
BASKING RIDGE, N.J., March 14, 2016 — Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLBS) (“Caladrius” or the “Company”), a leading cell therapy company combining an industry-leading development and manufacturing services provider (PCT, LLC, a Caladrius Company, or “PCT”) with a select therapeutic product pipeline, announces that Caladrius, through its subsidiary, PCT, has entered into a global collaboration with Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd. (Hitachi Chemical) that includes licensing, development and equity components. Hitachi Chemical is a global conglomerate with a growing franchise in life sciences, including regenerative medicine.
As part of the collaboration, Hitachi Chemical has purchased a 19.9% equity interest in PCT for $19.4 million.  Caladrius will retain the remaining 80.1% ownership of PCT. Caladrius intends to use the acquired capital for continued expansion and improvements at PCT in support of commercial product launch readiness as well as for general corporate purposes.
In addition, PCT has licensed its cell therapy technology and know-how to Hitachi Chemical for cell therapy manufacturing in certain Asian territories, including Japan, where the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) has introduced more favorable legislation to stimulate the growth of regenerative medicine development in Japan. Under the license agreement, Hitachi Chemical is to make upfront and near term milestone payments of $5.6 million.  In addition, Hitachi Chemical will pay service fees and royalties on contract revenue in those territories.  Under the license arrangement, Hitachi Chemical is responsible for all capital and operational expenses associated with the establishment and operation of the Asian business on which PCT is entitled to royalty payments.
PCT and Hitachi Chemical have also agreed to explore the establishment of a joint venture in Europe.
“We are delighted about this collaboration with a company of the stature and global reach of Hitachi Chemical as it represents a clear validation of the PCT business model, technology and know-how.  Importantly, it now values our PCT business at approximately $100 million and provides non-dilutive capital that strengthens our financial position,” said David J. Mazzo, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Caladrius. “Together, Caladrius, PCT and Hitachi Chemical are focused on building a global leadership position in cell therapy development and manufacturing with this transformative collaboration.”
“This partnership with Hitachi Chemical underscores the value of PCT’s expertise in cell therapy manufacturing and process development and will allow for the acceleration of our vision to create a global commercial enterprise with deep engineering expertise. Moreover, Hitachi Chemical’s investment in PCT shows its confidence in the growth of the cell therapy field as the field continues to shift towards Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and into commercial distribution as regulatory approvals are obtained,” said Robert A. Preti, PhD, President of PCT.  “By leveraging this expanded footprint, our clients will gain global access to the cell and cell-based gene therapy markets of tomorrow, where we expect engineering solutions to process optimization and automation will play a seminal role.”
“Our aim is to establish global leadership in regenerative medicine and we believe this deep collaboration with PCT, through its veteran cell therapy manufacturing experts and global brand, can power that into a reality,” said Kazuyuki Tanaka, President and CEO of Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd. “By leveraging PCT’s expertise and cell therapy technology, complementing PCT’s capabilities with our own and launching joint initiatives in new geographies, we will advance together towards that goal. In addition to using PCT’s support, Hitachi Chemical will receive technological assistance from Hitachi Group to develop a production control system, including automated facilities, to manufacture low cost yet high quality regenerative medicine cells, while also promoting consumable materials such as containers and reagents.”
Conference Call
As previously announced, Caladrius management will host a conference call to discuss the Company’s 2015 fourth quarter and year-end financial results, at which time management will also discuss this announcement. The conference call will be held on March 15, 2016 at 5:00 pm Eastern time.

Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc Enters into New Five-Year Strategic Manufacturing Agreement with PCT for the Supply of Adaptimmune’s SPEAR T-Cell Therapies
Sep 19 16
Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc has entered into a new five-year strategic manufacturing agreement with PCT for the supply of Adaptimmune’s SPEAR T-cell therapies. Under the contract, Adaptimmune will benefit from exclusive access to an EU and FDA compliant manufacturing unit at PCT as well as dedicated, specialist staff. Adaptimmune’s relationship with PCT is intended to provide Adaptimmune with maximum operational flexibility for the manufacture of its SPEAR T-cell products from development, through clinical manufacturing and ultimately, subject to marketing authorizations, into commercialization. The manufacturing process for Adaptimmune’s SPEAR T-cell therapies consists of isolating T-cells from the blood of cancer patients; transferring affinity enhanced TCRs, which have been modified to recognize cancer cells, into the cells; activating and expanding the T-cells; and, introducing the affinity enhanced cells back into the patient to enable the patient’s immune system to attack cancer.

And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.

What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3

2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
