TAUTACHROME | Welcome










Welcome to

For over 70 years Kodachrome™ was the market leader of physical print and motion colour pictures and now Tautachrome seeks to fill those shoes with our patent and patent pending digital picture technology














Trusted and Engageable Imagery




























We are Tautachrome
Tautachrome, Inc. is an Internet technology development company. The Company's top priority is developing its branded KlickZie platform which will turn smartphones into trustable imagers meaning the pictures and videos they capture can be verified as original, untampered and un-photoshopped. Furthermore the technology creates imagery that is 
interactive and engageable. By clicking or tapping on a KlickZie'd image, users will be able to communicate with the image's 
author or others currently viewing the image in an engaging manner. The KlickZie platform will serve as the world's first imagery-based 
social portal network. Tautachrome, Inc. (Ticker: TTCM) is a publicly traded Delaware Corporation.   It recently announced the issuance of its wholly owned US Patent number 9,582,843, a key KlickZie technology patent aimed at the authentication of smartphone imagery from a Tautachrome managed Authentication Centric Entity (ACE) KlickZie cloud.

Tautachrome Lyrics
Lookin’ at all the years I've lived

Through my crystal ball

Every good thing and all the friends I've had

Thinkin’ of all the love I've shared

And all the love lost

Takin’ pictures in my mind to capture it all

Tautachro-o-ome

Looking at all these faces

Every smile never fades

Holding all of these moments

For me to save --oh yeah

And if the world’s my canvas

Then let me see it all the way

All I need is my Tautachrome today

Don't take my Tautachrome

Cus’ some nights I'm home alone

And I wanna see your picture cus I miss ya

So I pick up my phone

I wanna show the word where I've been and see what they've seen

I just wanna enhance the way it feels

And they could see the colors of my imagination

And it looks so good and feels so real

Tautachro-o-ome

Looking at all these faces

Every smile never fades

Holding all of these moments

For me to save --oh yeah

And if the world’s my canvas

Then let me see it all the way

All I need is my Tautachrome today

Don't take my Tautachrome

Cus’ some nights I'm home alone

And I wanna see your picture cus I miss ya

So I pick up my phone

Look at you in that vivid color

Sometimes it makes me wonder

Where would I be if I couldn't see you

Through my Tautachrome preview

Mamma don’t take my Tautachrome

Mamma don’t take my dog and bone away

Mamma don’t take my Tautachrome

Mamma don’t take my dog and bone away








Redefine...
Our purpose is to become the world's No. 1 smartphone imaging system. Allowing everyone to take pictures and videos that are automatically ALWAYS TRUSTED: Never digitally manipulated. Always the true original.









 Imagery...
While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the modern world has made pictures the new multicultural language and Tautachrome’s patent and patent pending digital imagery will be the benchmark for the new world.









 Forever.
With Tautachrome patent and patent pending trusted engageable digital imagery, the landscape will never be the same again.











What is the Problem?
Digital imagery is easily falsified and lacks the engageability proposed by Tautachrome’s patent and patent pending technology.



















Every picture tells a story
With Tautachrome’s patent and patent pending technology not only will pictures tell a story, they will come to life with engageabilty not currently available.

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article VII. ARTICLE VIII The Corporation reserves the right to amend this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in any manner permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law and all rights and powers conferred upon stockholders, directors and officers herein are granted subject to this reservation.  3
 

rdsh_ex992.htmEXHIBIT 99.2   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 4 November 2015  ROADSHIPS HOLDINGS, Inc. CHANGES NAME TO TAUTACHROME Inc.  TUSCON, Arizona, November 4, 2015 Tautachrome, Inc. (OTC-PINK: TTCM) today announced that the corporate name change has now been effected from Roadships Holdings, Inc. to Tautachrome, Inc., together with a symbol change from RDSH to TTCM.  Tautachrome is an Internet technology development company with operations in America and Australia. Tautachrome which has a number of revolutionary patents pending, including Talk-to-the-Picture social networking and trustable imagery-based interaction, is now forging forward with planned business developments after divesting the Roadships business in October 2015. The name change is an integral part of Company's vision for itself in the balance of the 21st century.  The Company's top priority is developing its branded KlickZie platform which will turn smartphones into trustable imagers meaning they are capable of capturing pictures and videos that can be verified as original, untampered and un-photoshopped. Furthermore the KlickZie platform will serve as the world's first imagery-based social portal network. By Clicking on a KlickZie'd image, users will be able to communicate with the image's author orother viewers in an engaging manner.  Tautachrome's Australian based subsidiary, Polybia Studios is a full service app development and digital design company. Earlier this year, Polybia Studios delivered the Safedate app for final review and release and is now firmly entrenched in ongoing development work for Tautachrome products slated, such as Tautachrome's Klickzie app. "The name change to Tautochrome captures our business model of advancing new dimensions in human interaction with revolutionary digital imagery products," said Dr Jon N Leonard, CEO of Tautachrome, Inc.  About Tauatchrome, Inc. Tauatachrome, Inc. (OTC-PINK: TTCM) is an emerging growth company in the developing digital imagery technology sector.  Safe Harbor Statement Statements made in this press release are forward-looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, general business conditions, managing growth, and political and other business risks. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph and the risks and other factors detailed in Tautachrome's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tautachrome undertakes no duty to update these forward-looking statements.  Contact; Tautachrome, Inc.  Contact; Polybia Studios Pty Ltd Tel; +1 520 318 5578  Tel; +61 7 5554 5883 Email; jon@tautachrome.com  Cell; 0439 800 915 Web; www.tautachrome.com  Email; anugent@polybiastudios.com

TUSCON, Ariz., Nov. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Tautachrome, Inc. (OTC-PINK: TTCM) today announced that the corporate name change has now been effected from Roadships Holdings, Inc. to Tautachrome, Inc., together with a symbol change from RDSH to TTCM. 
Tautachrome is an Internet technology development company with operations in America and Australia. Tautachrome which has a number of revolutionary patents pending, including Talk-to-the-Picture social networking and trustable imagery-based interaction, is now forging forward with planned business developments after divesting the Roadships business in October 2015. The name change is an integral part of Company's vision for itself in the balance of the 21st century. 
The Company's top priority is developing its branded KlickZie platform which will turn smartphones into trustable imagers meaning they are capable of capturing pictures and videos that can be verified as original, untampered and un-photoshopped. Furthermore the KlickZie platform will serve as the world's first imagery-based social portal network. By Clicking on a KlickZie'd image, users will be able to communicate with the image's author or other viewers in an engaging manner. 
Tautachrome's Australian based subsidiary, Polybia Studios is a full service app development and digital design company. Earlier this year, Polybia Studios delivered the Safedate app for final review and release and is now firmly entrenched in ongoing development work for Tautachrome products slated, such as Tautachrome's Klickzie app.
"The name change to Tautochrome captures our business model of advancing new dimensions in human interaction with revolutionary digital imagery products," said Dr Jon N Leonard, CEO of Tautachrome, Inc. 
About Tauatchrome, Inc.
Tauatachrome, Inc. (OTC-PINK: TTCM) is an emerging growth company in the developing digital imagery technology sector.

There isn't any product Rocky, just a patent and a conception.  TTCM has no revenues either, despite acquiring Photo Sweep and Polybia Studios.   That's called the hook up.   It's just another penny stock ruse.
