M. Amy Gilliland, senior vice president of human resources and administration at General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), has been named deputy for operations at the company’s information technology business in a move that takes effect April 1.
The 12-year General Dynamics veteran will also continue to perform her additional duties as a corporate officer and senior VP, the company said Wednesday.
Kimberly Kuryea, a corporate VP and controller, will replace Gilliland as HR and administration SVP.
She previously served as chief financial officer of the advanced information systems unit, staff vice president for internal audit and director of financial planning and analysis.
Before she joined the company in 2000, Kuryea worked at the government contracting practice of accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP.
General Dynamics selected William Moss, currently staff VP for internal audit, to succeed Kuryea as the firm’s controller.
Prior to his current role, Moss held the positions of staff VP for accounting at the General Dynamics headquarters and director of financial reporting for the information systems business.
Both Kuryea and Moss will also assume their new responsibilities beginning next month.
