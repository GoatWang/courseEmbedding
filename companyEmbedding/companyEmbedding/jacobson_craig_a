Craig Jacobson

Craig JacobsonPoint Source PowerOrganization: Point Source PowerIntroPresentationWhat is Point Source Power?An economical fuel cell for emerging markets that allows battery charging in cooking pits or fires.A simple, affordable fuel cell that allows users to create electricity as an added benefit of cooking with biomass-fueled cook stoves.THE PROBLEMIf it could be effectively harnessed, thermal heat generated by cook stoves could help provide power for the 1.5 billion people worldwide who do not have adequate access to electricity and use costly, cumbersome, and toxic solutions for lighting their homes and charging their cell phones.
THE INNOVATIONA low-cost fuel cell that operates at cook stove temperatures and converts biomass directly to electricity. These fuel cells run on anything that burns, from gasses and liquids like LPG, biogas, and ethanol, to solids like wood, charcoal, and even cow dung. A user will be able to simply put biomass in a container and place it in their cook stove. As it heats, the biomass will generate gases that will be converted to electricity.
“People view fuel cells as an advanced technology that only wealthy countries can afford. We see things differently. We’ve created a technology that uses inexpensive materials found in homes throughout developing regions of the world – biomass and cook stoves.” – Craig Jacobson, Co-founder and CEO of Point Source Power

THE VISIONElectricity production in the home will accelerate users’ ability to read, write, and learn in the home, as well as more easily communicate with mobile phones and other personal electronic devices. Users save time and money, and this technology operates rain or shine.
“We need a simple, affordable technology that easily integrates into the daily lives of people in underserved regions of the world. Cooking is something that has to be done every day. We have taken cutting edge technology and matched it to this daily ritual.” – Craig Jacobson, Co-founder and CEO of Point Source Power

Mr. Romano zealously defended the matter, utilized both conventional and creative legal strategies, and ultimately achieved a favorable ruling on my behalf. His office ensured that my interests were at all times at the forefront of their decision making process and Mr. Romano regularly communicated and advised me on what he considered the best way to proceed. His office promptly returned both phone calls and emails and Mr. Romano made sure that he was always available to answer questions or concerns that I raised. Mr. Romano even went as far as working on the weekend when the court imposed strict deadlines for the filing of a memorandum. He also did an excellent job of utilizing my own opinions and preferences and incorporating that into his legal theory. After working with Mr. Romano and Mrs. Dragt for almost four years, I am in a position to confidently endorse his office as being highly capable and proficient at handling legal matters with creativity, tenacity, and sensitivity by utilizing a client-centered and solution driven perspective. The word uncompromising readily comes to mind. And, on a personal note, this was the easiest five star review I've ever written as I am very grateful to Mr. Romano, Mrs. Dragt, and the rest of his office for their diligent work.Goldberg Jones -Divorce For Menscottashton ratedI needed an attorney to help m...I needed an attorney to help me with custody and because of this firm's gravitation towards helping men in a world where the mother is usually the main focus I decided to retain their services...and I couldn't be happier. The attorney they chose for me was Chance Fewel, he was a perfect fit. My case was/is complicated and he was not only empathetic but aggressive and it seemed he always had an alternate route to take. Having options is very important. I can't tell you how many times I emailed Chance frustrated with how I was being treated by my ex and every time he made me feel like it would be ok, to take it easy and let him do what he does. That was a life saver! The last thing but maybe the most important, money. When we think lawyer we think big money. Chance went out of his way to always let me know what my options were within my budget and what best to spend that o . What shocked me was that Chance also took the time to let me know what to do so I could maximize every dollar I paid. I've never been a "tell your friends" person but with how important it is to have a solid attorney for custody and how phenomenal Chance and Goldberg-Jones have been, I wouldn't hesitate recommending the firm to a complete stranger. Thank you guys!Brian Patrick Conry P.C.Serna V. ratedBrian P Conry was hired by my family to fight for my brother’s deportation case. My brother was detained in Texas where the immigration judges are much tougher (heartless) so our priority was for his case to be transferred to Oregon as well as for our brother to be released while we fought his case to obtain his permanent legal status. Mr. Conry and his team worked very hard to not only have the case transferred to Oregon, have our brother released in the US while we fought the case but best of all WIN the case. Because of the professionalism, knowledge and many more qualities Mr. Conry and his team won our brother’s case. Our brother is now a legal permanent resident of the USA. The law office of Brian P Conry provided our family with guidance every step of the way. Mr. Conry was always professional, understanding, honest & respectful. Hiring Brian P Conry was the best decision our family could have done. We will always be thankful and recommend his services without a doubt.Goldberg Jones -Divorce For Menscottsmith2014 ratedAfter not being represented in...After not being represented in my original divorce judgment I had to work even harder to regain some sort of reasonable outcome. Brad took the time to make sure that my requests were met and offered council in a very professional manner. My finances were limited and he made sure that I got what I needed in a timely fashion and saved me money by not using our time for unecessary startegies or non-productive suggestions. Being in the state of Washingtn offered some challenges with a case that originated in Oregon but we were able to overcome these with a very positive results. I can't stress enough how important it is to have proper representation and the folks at Goldberg Jones are the best at making sure their clients are treated with courtesy and respect. Thanks again for getting me what I needed and "hats off" to Brad for doing a great job!Rick Fowlks, AttorneyDouble D. ratedRick is the best! !!

The folks at G&J were kind, courteous and attentive to my case in all aspects.  My attorney Liam McGill is exceptional at his trade and not only pays attention to detail but listens to the input you have about the case.  I would recommend G&J to anyone going through the tedious divorce process.  After the divorce is finalized and of course there might be an appeal, G&J will not only find you an appeals attorney but maintain their presence through out the appeal and finalize any further legal issues and documentaion that might arise.   Law Offices of Jon Friedmanmoses.hattrick ratedDear Mr. Friedman, thank you f...Dear Mr. Friedman, thank you for the respect you showed for my wonderful mother during the 20 months of handling her wrongful death case. I couldn’t have kept going through the painful times had I not felt good and comfortable with my attorneys. It was a very difficult thing to endure, but you made it feel smooth and safe. I would give back every penny to have one more precious moment with my angel mom. Thank you for taking the time to get to know her throughout the case. I am sure you felt some of her strength and beauty. It was an honor to have you represent her. You did her proud!Elzinga & Associates LLCkellyand. ratedIf you are looking for a lawye...If you are looking for a lawyer Ronn is your guy.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
