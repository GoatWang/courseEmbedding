iHome Zenergy
There are many factors that can contribute to a decreased amount or quality of sleep; iHome Zenergy strives to alleviate some of these factors by utilizing a combination of light therapy and sound therapy.


How does Zenergy Light Therapy work?
Your circadian rhythm, or the timing of your internal clock, is linked to the changing wavelengths of light throughout the day.  When properly exposed to these wavelengths, your body will keep a natural sleep-wake schedule.  But throughout our busy daily routines, it is difficult to get the exposure to natural light our bodies need.  Color Light Therapy simulates these wavelengths, triggering subtle biological responses that can help improve your sleep, energy, and mood.   
How does Zenergy Sound Therapy work?
Distracting noises or a racing mind can make it difficult to sleep at night or focus during the day.  Sound Therapy uses a combination of specially recorded and custom engineered sounds to cancel out these distractions and allow your busy mind to calm.


The Sleep Doctor Recommended
The Sleep Doctor, Michael Breus, PhD is the nation’s most trusted authority on sleep.

Znergy Inc is DO 18-A certified and complies to DOLE regulations.
DO 18-A was a product of deliberations conducted by a trilateral body composed of the government, through the DOLE, the employer and employee representatives. It was basically a response to the clamor of labor and management alike for the government to come up with rules defining and protecting the rights of workers in a contracting arrangement and eliminating the so-called fly-by-night contractors.
