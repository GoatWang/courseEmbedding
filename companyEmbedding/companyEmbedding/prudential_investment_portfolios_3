How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

 What now?  


There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.




 1. Create a retirement income strategy 
 2. Maximize 
                  social security 




 Learn how annuities can help keep your money growing in 
                    retirement, and turn a lump sum into guaranteed income that 
                    lasts for as long as you live. See more → 
 If you are entitled to collect income from Social Security, 
                    there are steps you can take to help you maximize your benefit.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

About ETFs:
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a more diversified investment that trades like a stock but pools the money of many investors to purchase a group of assets such as stocks, bonds, foreign currency or commodities. Some of the most popular
                ETFs offer a type of index investment, where the manager seeks to track the performance of a specific index such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500. There are a few types of high risk ETFs such as leveraged and inverse which are short-term,
                higher-risk investments that should only be implemented by experienced traders.

About bonds:
A bond is a form of debt security in which an investor lends money to an entity in return for interest. The bond acts as an IOU — once it matures, the bond issuer pays you back the money, plus interest.
Each bond has unique characteristics that investors need to understand prior to purchase. Generally, the higher the interest rate, the riskier the investment.

Can I transfer my account from another broker?



Yes. You can fund your Ally Invest account by transferring assets from another brokerage firm.
You'll need to submit an asset transfer request form (ACAT form).
We'll also need a recent statement for the account that you want to transfer. You can fax the documents to us at 1-855-880-25591-855-880-2559, or you can send them by mail to one of the following addresses:
Ally Invest Securities

P.O. Box 49050

Charlotte, NC 28277-3432
For overnight deliveries, mail to:
Ally Invest Securities

11605 N Community House Rd

Third Floor

Charlotte, NC 28277
Account transfers normally complete in 5 to 7 business days. Keep in mind, the account at the other broker and account you have with us must be the same kind (such as individual, joint or IRA).
After an account transfer processes, some assets may remain in the account at the carrying firm. This is quite common, for example, with interests that were not yet in the account at the carrying firm when the transfer completed. To make sure your transfer is complete, our clearing firm performs automatic residual sweeps every 2 weeks to transfer what might have not transferred the first time around.
We do not charge for incoming ACAT account transfers. There may be a fee for other types of transfers.

				The Power of Tax Deferral
			 
		






When you invest in a tax-deferred account such as a variable annuity, you delay paying income tax until you begin taking withdrawals, presumably after you retire.
So, instead of paying taxes on any investment growth each year, you keep that money compounding to help grow your retirement savings.

 Assumptions: 7% annual growth for all hypothetical accounts. The taxable investments assume taxes are withdrawn at 25% and 39.6% at the end of every year.
Tax-deferred accounts are subject to ordinary income tax at the time of withdrawals.
The hypothetical example does not reflect a specific annuity, an actual account value or the performance of any investment. It does not include fees or portfolio expenses which would lower performance.

Rebalancing your portfolio, portfolio turnover, and frequent trading can all have a signiﬁcant impact on investment return.  Premier Investment’s tax-free transfers let you move money within your investments without the tax implications.
























Tell your financial advisor if you've experienced the following:
These clues may indicate inefficiencies in how your money is being managed:

You received a 1099 form even though you didn't buy or sell an investment
You are receiving income that you are not spending
You receive dividends to support your income
Your income limits your year-end deductions , or ability to claim passive losses

This shows how the pro-growth fee structure works compared to a traditional fee structure.
It's important to note that your account value will fluctuate throughout the life of your contract, and if it falls below your premiums then your fee would be higher than the traditional annuity fee.

Footnote

What is a variable annuity?

A variable annuity is a contract with an insurance company. It's a long-term investment designed for retirement purposes. You invest money in professionally managed investment portfolios, where it accumulates tax-deferred. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. When you retire, your investment can be used to generate a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed for as long as you live. In addition, variable annuities may provide a guaranteed death benefit for your beneficiaries. It is important to remember that annuity contracts contain exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force.

Why does the company behind the annuity matter?

When the time comes for you to use the benefits that are offered by a variable annuity it is important to remember that all guarantees including the optional benefits are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and do not apply to the underlying investment options.

Who can help me determine if an annuity is right for me?

Your financial professional can help you determine if a variable annuity is suitable for you. Prudential Annuities and its distributors and representatives do not provide tax, accounting, or legal advice. Please consult your own attorney or accountant when making important investment decisions.
	Prudential Annuities does not provide investment advice. The selections you choose together with your financial professional are all dependent on your investment goals and your risk tolerance.

What happens if I need access to my money?

There are limitations and restrictions when making withdrawals. Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to contingent deferred sales charges. Withdrawals and distributions of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if made prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty, sometimes referred to as an additional income tax. Withdrawals reduce the account value and the living and death benefits proportionately.

What is the Protected Withdrawal Value?

The Protected Withdrawal Value is only used to calculate the initial guaranteed lifetime income and the charge for the benefit. It is separate from the account value and is not available as a lump sum withdrawal. The account value is not guaranteed, can fluctuate, and may lose value.

What are the costs associated with purchasing this product?

The Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuities are available at an annual insurance cost comprised of a .55% account value-based charge and a .55% premium-based charge for the B Series, and .68% account value- based charge and a .67% premium-based charge for the C Series with additional fees related to the professionally managed investment portfolios. The Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit is available for an additional annual insurance cost comprised of a .18% account value-based charge and a .17% premium-based charge. Additional fees, such as withdrawal fees, transfer fees and administrative fees, also apply. See the prospectus for more information about how these charges are calculated.

What are some of the other things I need to consider when investing in this product?

If you invest in this product through a tax-advantaged retirement plan, such as an IRA, SEP-IRA, Roth IRA, 401(a) plan, or non-ERISA 403(b) plan, you will get no additional tax advantage through the annuity itself. Because there is no additional tax advantage when a variable annuity is purchased through one of these plans, the reasons for purchasing the annuity inside a qualified plan are limited to the ability to elect the Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit, the opportunity to annuitize the contract, and the various investment options, which might make the annuity an appropriate investment for you. You should consult your tax and financial advisors regarding such features and benefits prior to purchasing this annuity for use with a tax-qualified plan.

What are some of the other considerations that I need to think about when investing in various asset allocation portfolios offered by a variable annuity?

It is important to remember that asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. The value or price of a particular stock or other equity or equity-related security owned by a portfolio could go down and you could lose money. Additionally, fixed income investments are subject to risk, including credit and interest rate risk. Because of these risks, a subaccount's share value may fluctuate. If interest rates rise, bond prices usually decline. If interest rates decline, bond prices usually increase. Certain asset allocation portfolios may use leverage, short sales, and derivatives or engage in other speculative practices within their alternative investments. These practices include a high degree of risk and may increase the risk, size, and velocity of investment losses. Although certain alternative strategies seek to reduce risk by attempting to reduce correlation with equity and bond markets, no guarantee can be given that such efforts will be successful. The fees and expenses associated with alternative investments are generally higher than those for traditional investments. Lastly, diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market.

What do I need to understand about some of the asset allocation portfolios (subaccounts) that are offered with this product?

Premier Investment offers certain subaccounts that invest in underlying portfolios or invest in other portfolios which are also available in other variable annuity contracts we offer. Those other variable annuity contracts offer certain optional living benefits that utilize a predetermined mathematical formula (the "formula") to manage the guarantees offered in connection with those optional benefits. You should be aware that the operation of the formula in those other variable annuity contracts may result in large-scale asset flows into and out of the underlying portfolios through a series of transfers. In addition to increasing the portfolios' expenses, the asset flows may adversely affect performance by

requiring the portfolios to purchase or sell securities at inopportune times;
otherwise limiting the sub-adviser's ability to fully implement the portfolios' investment strategies; or
requiring the portfolios to hold a larger portion of their assets in highly liquid securities than they otherwise would hold.

	Before you allocate to these subaccounts, you should consider the impact the formula will have on each portfolio's risk profile, expenses and performance. Please see the prospectus for more information and work with your financial professional to determine which portfolios are appropriate for you.

	 

What else do I need to consider with the pro-growth fee structure?

Premier Investment was built with an innovative pro-growth fee structure. While most traditional variable annuities (VAs) assess insurance charges daily based on account value, the insurance charge for the Premier Investment is assessed partially on account value and partially on cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals). When we refer to the “pro-growth” charge structure, we are illustrating that when compared to most traditional VAs, any growth in your account value will result in an overall insurance charge that represents a smaller percentage of account value (a lower “effective charge”). This is because the portion of the charge based on cumulative purchase payments remains constant. Conversely, if your account value were to decline below cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals), this would result in a higher effective charge.

Source: Morningstar. The Morningstar Rating may not be calculated based on its share class adjusted historical returns. If so, this investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric uses the fund's oldest share class to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Principal risks include: investing primarily in senior loans that are rated below investment grade; risk of investment in loans, where the Fund's ability to receive payments in connection with loans depends on the financial condition of the borrower (failure to receive such payments may reduce the value of the Fund's assets); fixed income instruments, which are subject to credit, market, and interest rate risk; interest rate risk, where the value will decline as interest rates rise; call and redemption risk, where the issuer may call a bond held by the Fund for redemption before it matures and the Fund may lose income; derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; high yield ("junk") bonds, which are subject to greater credit and market risks; foreign or non-U.S. securities, which are subject to the risks of currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; liquidity risk, which exists when particular investments are difficult to sell. The risks associated with the Fund are more fully explained in the prospectus and summary prospectus. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. These risks may increase the Fund's share price volatility. There is no guarantee the Fund's objective will be achieved.


Average Maturity is the average time to maturity for a bond. Credit quality is calculated using the highest rating assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) such as Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch. The Not Rated category consists of securities that have not been rated by an NRSRO. Duration measures investment risk that takes into account both a bond's interest payments and its value to maturity. Standard deviation depicts how widely returns vary around its average and is used to understand the range of returns most likely for a given fund. A higher standard deviation generally implies greater volatility. Due to data availability, statistics may not be as of the current reporting period.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

 What now?  


There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.




 1. Create a retirement income strategy 
 2. Maximize 
                  social security 




 Learn how annuities can help keep your money growing in 
                    retirement, and turn a lump sum into guaranteed income that 
                    lasts for as long as you live. See more → 
 If you are entitled to collect income from Social Security,

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

How are my accounts protected?

Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection.

This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

About ETFs:
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a more diversified investment that trades like a stock but pools the money of many investors to purchase a group of assets such as stocks, bonds, foreign currency or commodities. Some of the most popular
                ETFs offer a type of index investment, where the manager seeks to track the performance of a specific index such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500. There are a few types of high risk ETFs such as leveraged and inverse which are short-term,
                higher-risk investments that should only be implemented by experienced traders.

About bonds:
A bond is a form of debt security in which an investor lends money to an entity in return for interest. The bond acts as an IOU — once it matures, the bond issuer pays you back the money, plus interest.
Each bond has unique characteristics that investors need to understand prior to purchase. Generally, the higher the interest rate, the riskier the investment.

Can I transfer my account from another broker?



Yes. You can fund your Ally Invest account by transferring assets from another brokerage firm.
You'll need to submit an asset transfer request form (ACAT form).
We'll also need a recent statement for the account that you want to transfer. You can fax the documents to us at 1-855-880-25591-855-880-2559, or you can send them by mail to one of the following addresses:
Ally Invest Securities

P.O. Box 49050

Charlotte, NC 28277-3432
For overnight deliveries, mail to:
Ally Invest Securities

11605 N Community House Rd

Third Floor

Charlotte, NC 28277
Account transfers normally complete in 5 to 7 business days. Keep in mind, the account at the other broker and account you have with us must be the same kind (such as individual, joint or IRA).
After an account transfer processes, some assets may remain in the account at the carrying firm. This is quite common, for example, with interests that were not yet in the account at the carrying firm when the transfer completed. To make sure your transfer is complete, our clearing firm performs automatic residual sweeps every 2 weeks to transfer what might have not transferred the first time around.
We do not charge for incoming ACAT account transfers. There may be a fee for other types of transfers.

This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Options investors may lose the entire amount of their investment in a relatively short period of time.
Prior to buying or selling options, investors must read a copy of the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options brochure (PDF), also known as the options disclosure document. It explains the characteristics and risks of exchange traded options.

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments

Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.

We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
