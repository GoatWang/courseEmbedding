Risk Considerations
All investments contain risks, and investors should consider the risks associated with investing in these types of Funds. Value investing involves the risk that the Fund investment in companies whose securities are believed to be undervalued, relative to their underlying profitability, will not appreciate in value as anticipated.  Investing in foreign securities poses additional market risks since political and economic events unique in a country or region will affect those markets and their issuers.  Stocks of small companies may be more volatile than, and not as readily marketable as, those of larger companies.  Investments made in small capitalization companies are subject to a higher degree of market risk because they tend to be more volatile and less liquid when compared to larger, more established companies.
Investors should read the prospectus and carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Schneider Fund before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other information about the Fund, please download a copy or call 888-520-3277.
Performance data quoted represents past performance.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.  The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.  Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.

Philosophy & Process 

 
Investment Philosophy 
We believe that disciplined value investing, built on a research-driven foundation, can deliver investment success over time. Promising opportunities can be found among securities that are most deeply undervalued relative to their future earnings potential.

 
Strategy & Process
Deep value equity is the singular focus of Schneider Capital’s investment strategy. We employ an active strategy that invests primarily in U.S. equities with market capitalizations in the range of the relevant benchmark index.
To capture promising investment opportunities, our team engages in a systematic approach consisting of:

Insightful Research: geared towards identifying securities with low investor expectations that are temporarily trading at a substantial discount to their underlying business value
Thoughtful Stock Selection: facilitated by a proprietary ranking system that identifies which securities can add the most risk-adjusted value to the portfolio
A Rigorous Sell Discipline: designed to capture upside potential and prune portfolio laggards

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

                                            In a word: horrible. Stay far, far away from this nightmare of an experience from the website to the customer service line to the joke of a mobile app. Overdraft fees are insane at $37, sometimes more if they cover it.

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?
