Meet The Team



Founder Joey Herrick

Joey Herrick , The Founder of Lucy Pet Products and former President and co-founder of Natural Balance Pet Foods
×Joey Herrick
Joey Herrick is the President and founder of The Lucy Pet Foundation an animal charity based in Thousand Oaks, CA.
The Mission of The Lucy Pet Foundation is to reduce pet overpopulation by funding mobile spay/neuter clinics across the country and to support causes that benefit animal welfare. “Lucy” is the name of a female Chihuahua mix that was rescued by the Herrick family. She was found wandering in the mountains; completely covered with dirt, toenails curling under, tire marks on her back and malnourished. A few weeks after she was rescued, she gave birth to five puppies. Lucy and her pups became the inspiration for The Lucy Pet Foundation. Today Lucy is ten years old and comes to the office regularly to check on her Foundation.
Joey has a long record of supporting animals in need, with over 30 years of hands-on help. While Joey owned Natural Balance Pet Foods, he donated millions of pounds of food to animal rescue groups because it was his belief that they were the ones who were saving animal lives. He saw first hand how local rescue groups were going into the shelters, taking animals off death row and placing them into foster homes. After he sold Natural Balance in July 2013, he committed himself to do everything he could to help stop the 80,000 dogs and cats a week from being euthanized due to pet overpopulation.  Since he started the Lucy Pet Foundation in 2013, Herrick has spent over $1.9M of his own money operating mobile spay and neuter trucks in Southern California to provide low or no-cost spay and neuter services. As of April 2016, the Lucy Pet Foundation has spayed, neutered or vaccinated over 11,000 animals.
The reputation for the quality work that the Foundation does has been recognized by the City of Los Angeles. In January 2016, they awarded the Lucy Pet Foundation a multi-year, $500,000 per year contract to spay/neuter 10,000 animals over the next two years. The Lucy Pet Foundation is also the recipient of a $50,000 grant from the Petco Foundation to perform spay/neuters in local communities. In order for Herrick to achieve his goal to lower euthanasia rates nationwide, he founded Lucy Pet Products, which develops innovative products for the pet specialty retail channel. 100% of the profits from Lucy Pet Products will go to help fund the Lucy Pet Foundation to provide more spay/neuter and animal related causes.
