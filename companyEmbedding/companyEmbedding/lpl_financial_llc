FINRA Sanctions LPL Financial LLC $11.7 Million for Widespread Supervisory Failures Related to Complex Products Sales, Trade Surveillance and Trade Confirmations Delivery




LPL Ordered to Pay Approximately $1.7 Million in Restitution to Customers
WASHINGTON — The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced today that it has censured LPL Financial LLC and fined it $10 million for broad supervisory failures in a number of key areas, including the sales of non-traditional exchange-traded funds (ETFs), certain variable annuity contracts, non-traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other complex products, as well as its failure to monitor and report trades and deliver to customers more than 14 million trade confirmations. In addition to the fine, FINRA ordered LPL to pay approximately $1.7 million in restitution to certain customers who purchased non-traditional ETFs. The firm may pay additional compensation to ETF purchasers pending a review of its ETF systems and procedures.
Brad Bennett, FINRA Executive Vice President and Chief of Enforcement, said, "LPL's supervisory breakdowns resulted from a sustained failure to devote sufficient resources to compliance programs integral to numerous aspects of its business. With today's action, FINRA reaffirms that there is little room in the industry for lax supervision and that it will not hesitate to order firms to review and correct substandard supervisory systems and controls, and pay restitution to affected customers."
FINRA found that, at various times spanning multiple years, LPL failed to supervise sales of certain complex structured products, including ETFs, variable annuities and non-traded REITs. With regard to non-traditional ETFs, the firm did not have a system to monitor the length of time that customers held these securities in their accounts, did not enforce its limits on the concentration of those products in customer accounts, and failed to ensure that all of its registered representatives were adequately trained on the risks of the products. Also, LPL failed to supervise its sales of variable annuities, in some instances permitting sales without disclosing surrender fees, and in connection with certain mutual fund "switch" transactions, it used an automated surveillance system that excluded these trades from supervisory review. Additionally, LPL failed to supervise non-traded REITs by, among other things, failing to identify accounts eligible for volume sales charge discounts.
FINRA also found that LPL's systems to review trading activity in customer accounts were plagued by multiple deficiencies. For example, LPL used a surveillance system that failed to generate alerts for certain high-risk activity, including low-priced equity transactions, actively traded securities and potential employee front-running. The firm used a separate, but flawed, automated system to review its trade blotter that failed to provide trading activity past due for supervisory review. LPL failed to deliver over 14 million confirmations for trades in 67,000 customer accounts. In addition, due to coding defects that remained undetected for nearly six weeks, LPL's anti-money laundering surveillance system failed to generate alerts for excessive ATM withdrawals and ATM withdrawals in foreign jurisdictions. FINRA also found that LPL failed to report certain trades to FINRA and the MSRB, and failed to ensure it provided complete and accurate information to FINRA and to federal and state regulators concerning certain variable annuity transactions.
FINRA further found that LPL failed to reasonably supervise its advertising and other communications, including its registered representatives' use of consolidated reports. LPL did not monitor the creation or use of consolidated reports, and failed to ensure that these reports reflected complete and accurate information.
In settling this matter, LPL neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.
Investors can obtain more information about, and the disciplinary record of, any FINRA-registered broker or brokerage firm by using FINRA's BrokerCheck. FINRA makes BrokerCheck available at no charge. In 2014, members of the public used this service to conduct 18.9 million reviews of broker or firm records. Investors can access BrokerCheck at www.finra.org/brokercheck or by calling (800) 289-9999. Investors may find copies of this disciplinary action as well as other disciplinary documents in FINRA's Disciplinary Actions Online database.
FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, is the largest independent regulator for all securities firms doing business in the United States. FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation and complementary compliance and technology-based services. FINRA touches virtually every aspect of the securities business – from registering and educating all industry participants to examining securities firms, writing rules, enforcing those rules and the federal securities laws, and informing and educating the investing public. In addition, FINRA provides surveillance and other regulatory services for equities and options markets, as well as trade reporting and other industry utilities. FINRA also administers the largest dispute resolution forum for investors and firms. For more information, please visit www.finra.org.

The planned changes are intended to help advisors take proactive steps to adapt to this regulation, enabling them to expand their services to more investors and to continue to provide needed financial advice and flexible solutions to their clients.
"While we continue to advocate for a thoughtful resolution to the fiduciary issue—one that preserves investor choice—LPL recognizes that the DOL rule will have implications for financial advisors and investors," said Dan Arnold, president, LPL. "Since last summer, we have been preparing to ensure our advisors and the firm approach this opportunity from a position of strength. "Regardless of the final outcome, we expect demand for advisory services to increase going forward," continued Arnold. "We also believe that retirement investors will continue to benefit from a brokerage relationship and that the need for a brokerage offering will continue if these relationships can be supported under the DOL rule. The changes announced today position both LPL and our advisors for growth and increased market share, while offering 
choice and flexibility to serve a range of investors seeking both ongoing and occasional advice." Changes the firm plans to implement include: Price reductions: LPL plans to reduce the pricing of its centrally managed platforms in order to help advisors provide their services more cost-effectively and grow their practices by reaching more investors. In addition to the previously-announced elimination of the LPL Research strategist fee and annual IRA maintenance fee in its Model Wealth Portfolios (MWP) advisory platform earlier this year, the firm plans to further reduce MWP pricing in 2017. The change is expected to lower the total cost of accessing quality financial advice for investors in some cases by nearly 30% compared to current pricing. Lower account minimums: To help ensure that investors 
continue to have access to financial advice, LPL plans to lower the account minimums in its Optimum Market Portfolios (OMP) advisory platform from $15,000 to $10,000 later this year. As previously announced, LPL eliminated the IRA maintenance fee for OMP at the start of this year.  Simplified mutual-fund only brokerage IRA offering: In anticipation of the additional operational requirements the firm expects for direct business, LPL is planning to create a simplified mutual fund-only brokerage IRA offering to support the continued use of mutual funds in a brokerage relationship as an option for IRA business. This offering would allow LPL to support mutual funds previously held directly with manufacturers. The new offering is not expected to have an annual IRA maintenance fee.  Enhanced practice management 
capabilities to manage change: The firm plans to provide specialized practice management support to help advisors manage through changes in their practices, including licensing assistance and business analysis.  Operational enhancements to drive efficiency: The firm is also planning simplified operational processes—such as keeping account numbers unchanged when accounts are transitioned from brokerage to advisory accounts—that will allow investors who want to convert their accounts to do so in a more streamlined way.              "While much uncertainty remains as to what the final DOL rule will look like, LPL is taking a proactive approach by making changes to our platform and capabilities that we believe will help advisors grow their practices and support more investors in need of financial advice," said Arnold. 
"We are proud to use our size and scale as a market leader to further strengthen the transparency and value LPL provides to investors and the advisors who serve them."

Welcome to 
Holoman Financial Services
 Invest in Your Future 
 
 The investment climate has never been more exciting or more challenging than it is today. 
To take advantage of all available opportunities, investors need two things: an understanding of which investment products are most appropriate for their situation and a relationship with a trustworthy representative who has a clear understanding of their needs. 
 
By keeping clients' objectives in focus, staying in contact with them throughout all market conditions and making investment adjustments as economic or lifestyle conditions warrant, I maintain a constant commitment to putting service first. 
As a financial consultant, I offer clients an assortment of quality, non-proprietary investment choices. If you would like any further information about these topics, or other areas of investing, please don't hesitate to contact me, by phone or e-mail. I can help you make sense of today's investment climate.

FINRA Fines LPL Financial LLC $950,000 for Supervisory Failures Related to Sales of Alternative Investments




WASHINGTON — The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced today that it has fined LPL Financial LLC $950,000 for supervisory deficiencies related to the sales of alternative investment products, including non-traded real estate investment trusts (REITs), oil and gas partnerships, business development companies (BDCs), hedge funds, managed futures and other illiquid pass-through investments. As part of the sanction, LPL must also conduct a comprehensive review of its policies, systems, procedures and training, and remedy the failures.
Many alternative investments, such as REITs, set forth concentration limits for investors in their offering documents. In addition, certain states have imposed concentration limits for investors in alternative investments. LPL also established its own concentration guidelines for alternative investments. However, FINRA found that from January 1, 2008, to July 1, 2012, LPL failed to adequately supervise the sales of alternative investments that violated these concentration limits. At first, LPL used a manual process to review whether an investment complied with suitability requirements, relying on information that was at times outdated and inaccurate. The firm later implemented an automated system for review, but that database contained flawed programming and was not updated in a timely manner to accurately reflect suitability standards. LPL also did not adequately train its supervisory staff to analyze state suitability standards as part of their suitability reviews of alternative investments.
Brad Bennett, FINRA Executive Vice President and Chief of Enforcement, said, "In order to sell alternative investments, a broker-dealer must tailor its supervisory system to these products. LPL exposed customers to unacceptable risks by not having an adequate system in place that could accurately review whether a transaction complies with suitability requirements imposed by the states, the product issuers and the firm itself – and it failed to train its registered representatives to apply all the suitability guidelines appropriately."
In settling this matter, LPL Financial LLC neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.
Investors can obtain more information about, and the disciplinary record of, any FINRA-registered broker or brokerage firm by using FINRA's BrokerCheck. FINRA makes BrokerCheck available at no charge. In 2013, members of the public used this service to conduct 16.5 million reviews of broker or firm records. Investors can access BrokerCheck at www.finra.org/brokercheck or by calling (800) 289-9999. Investors may find copies of this disciplinary action as well as other disciplinary documents in FINRA's Disciplinary Actions Online database.
FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, is the largest independent regulator for all securities firms doing business in the United States. FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation and complementary compliance and technology-based services. FINRA touches virtually every aspect of the securities business – from registering and educating all industry participants to examining securities firms, writing rules, enforcing those rules and the federal securities laws, informing and educating the investing public, providing trade reporting and other industry utilities, and administering the largest dispute resolution forum for investors and firms. For more information, please visit www.finra.org.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
