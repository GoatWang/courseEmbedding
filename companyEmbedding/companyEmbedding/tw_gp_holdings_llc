Enterprise GP Holdings And Enterprise Products Partners Complete Merger






Business Wire




Nov 22, 2010 1:03 PM EST













 


















































  Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. (NYSE: EPE) (“EPE”) and Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) (“EPD”) have announced that the merger of EPE with a subsidiary of EPD was completed today.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, EPE unitholders are entitled to receive 1.50 EPD common units for each EPE unit owned at the effective time of the merger. Cash will be paid to EPE unitholders in accordance with the merger agreement in lieu of any fractional units they otherwise would have been entitled to receive. Based on the cash distributions paid in November 2010 by EPE and EPD, this will result in a 52 percent increase in cash distributions for the unitholders of EPE. As previously announced, the transaction has resulted in the cancellation of the 2% economic general partner interest in EPD and the general partner incentive distribution rights. In connection with the merger closing, an affiliate of EPCO has agreed to waive the distributions that it would otherwise be entitled to receive on certain EPD common units for the next five years.  “Enterprise GP Holdings is pleased to complete this merger,” stated Dr. Ralph S. Cunningham, president and chief executive officer of EPE. “Our voting unitholders overwhelmingly supported the merger with over 99 percent of the votes cast voted in favor of the merger.”  “The completion of this merger is a major event in the history of Enterprise Products Partners,” said Michael A. Creel, president and chief executive officer of EPD. “The permanent elimination of our general partner’s incentive distribution rights reduces our long-term cost of equity capital which will allow us to generate more accretion in terms of distributable cash flow as we continue to grow our partnership. The merger also simplifies our ownership structure.”  With the completion of the merger, EPE has merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of EPD. The surviving entity continues to hold noncontrolling interests in Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. The common units that EPE held in EPD have been cancelled. EPD’s common units will continue to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EPD. EPE’s units, which had been trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol EPE, will be delisted and no longer publicly traded as of the opening of the stock market on November 23, 2010. The former general partner of EPE, EPE Holdings, LLC (to be renamed Enterprise Products Holdings LLC following the merger on November 22, 2010), has become the successor general partner of EPD in connection with the merger.
