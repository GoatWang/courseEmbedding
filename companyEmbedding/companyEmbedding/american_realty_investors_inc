A Real Estate Investment Location is a neighborhood or a set of neighborhoods where there are investment properties that produce positive cash flow after deducting all monthly expenses, including mortgage payments. 
Real Estate Investment Locations

 
HomeUnion has identified Real Estate Investment Locations that meet the cash flow requirement as well as a number of other criteria such as:

Employment
Median income
Area comps
Access to mass transit
Quality of schools
Employer diversity
Average tenancy 

We determines if a neighborhood fits the definition through extensive use of our proprietary algorithms and ‘boots on the ground’- some of these local property managers have more than 20 years in their location.
Properties tend to be in middle-class locations. High end neighborhoods don’t provide adequate cash flow, and lower priced neighborhoods lack a stable tenant base. We look for Return on Investment for our clients; which means finding properties with high rent-to-purchase-price ratios in economically viable areas.
And Now, Investing in Real Estate is As Simple
With HomeUnion it’s now easy to invest in real estate. You invest, we do the rest. Tell us your investment goals, and we’ll help you build a real estate investment plan to match your goals. Our experts will take care of the entire acquisition process as well as the ongoing management of the property. We’ll also provide you with market intelligence for buy, hold or sell decisions. Our goals are to maximize your returns, protect your assets and provide you with 100% transparency in the process. Learn how you can identify investment properties within a good investment location neighborhood. Download our Definitive Guide to Investment Properties.

Invest in 1031 Eligible PropertiesDefer Capital Gains on Your Real Estate Investment.Become a 1031 Investor 







What is a 1031 Exchange?
A 1031 exchange is a powerful wealth management tool. Real estate investors can defer their capital gains tax on the sale of a property if they reinvest the proceeds in another qualifying property under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1031.


 










1031 Exchange Benefits:


Defer capital gains taxes on the sale of your property.
Invest in cash flowing properties and look to receive monthly distributions.
Ensure certainty of closing and avoid property management headaches.
Diversify your portfolio with a broad range of geography and property types.



 









1031 Exchange Risks:


A 1031 Exchange is a complicated transaction. Investors should consult their tax professionals.
The underlying investments in Real Estate are Illiquid Investments.
Investors who fail to complete their 1031 exchange in the allowable time (typically 180 days) lose their capital gains tax protection.
Each investment has its own risks and the investor should review offering materials for a full review of those risks.

MogulREIT I FAQs

What is MogulREIT?

MogulREIT I is a limited liability company formed to invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments, such as loans, equity in commercial real estate ventures, and other real estate-related assets.
MogulREIT I is a registered, non-traded REIT. That means that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but is not traded on a stock exchange. MogulREIT I intends to qualify as a REIT beginning with its taxable year ending December 31, 2016.

What types of properties or investments go into MogulREIT?

MogulREIT can invest in a variety of property types, including but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, medical office, and hospitality. The fund can invest in various commercial real estate-related equity and debt securities across these different property types.

Who can invest in MogulREIT? 

MogulREIT is available to both accredited and non-accredited investors. Non-accredited investors must have net worth and annual income greater than $10,000. 

What is the minimum amount I can invest in MogulREIT?

The minimum investment is $1,000.

Can I invest in MogulREIT I using a SDIRA (Self-Directed IRA) or other type of retirement account?

Yes. We have added the ability to take retirement funds into MogulREIT I. This means you can use your SDIRA to make investments.

How liquid is an investment in MogulREIT?

In the first quarter of 2017 we updated our Redemption Plan (now referred to as the Share Repurchase Program) to allow for a higher repurchase rate, faster. Share Repurchases from MogulREIT I are generally allowed on a quarterly basis, subject to the share repurchase rights and limitations outlined in the Offering Circular.

How is investing in MogulREIT different from other investment opportunities offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform?

The RealtyMogul.com Platform offers individual real property-related investments as private placements to accredited investors only. The RealtyMogul.com Platform allows accredited investors to review due diligence materials for individual transactions and invest in one transaction at a time. Investing in MogulREIT is different since investment decisions are made by our Manager and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property. Additionally, MogulREIT is accessible to both accredited and non-accredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

Who is on the Manager team of MogulREIT?

RealtyMogul.com has a highly experienced team of real estate finance professionals, led by Jilliene Helman, its Chief Executive Officer. Many of the senior executives and loan origination professionals at RealtyMogul.com have deep experience in the commercial real estate sector and have been in leadership roles at financial services institutions for many years. Collectively, these professionals have approximately 200 years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business, and have managed more than $4 billion of originations and more than $8.5 billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments. The Company benefits from the knowledge and industry contacts, experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles. Learn more.
The credit team of RealtyMogul.com is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments. RealtyMogul.com’s Chief Credit Officer, Megan Goodfellow, has been involved in institutional finance for three decades, specializing in the analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies.  Ms. Goodfellow has assembled a strong team of credit and underwriting professionals whose expertise has been honed in the service of RealtyMogul.com, and which will be brought to bear for MogulREIT’s benefit.

What services will the Manager perform?

The Manager performs the following services: investment advisory and acquisition services (including performing due diligence on our investments), offering services, asset management services, accounting and other administrative services, shareholder services, financing services, and disposition services.

How does RealtyMogul.com decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t?

MogulREIT I pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its Offering Circular. Some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either MogulREIT I or the RealtyMogul.com Platform. In these instances, any potential debt investment exceeding $1,000,000 and equity investment exceeding $1,500,000 will first be made available to MogulREIT I. If the fund chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for Realty Mogul, then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the RealtyMogul.com Platform. MogulREIT I may, where the investment committee of its Manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the fund, permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

This material is designed to provide general information regarding the subject matter covered. No guarantee of future results or outcomes either expressed or implied, is being made.  Investing involves risks. Since no one investment program is suitable for all types of investors you need to review your  investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs before selecting an investment program. It is possible to lose money. You should periodically review your investment allocations particularly if your circumstances change. There is no assurance that an investment will achieve their objectives. Asset allocation does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.

It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in

            you'll need each year.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html

Unexpected
LOSS OF
INCOME


You're already challenged to generate retirement income that could last 20 or 30 years. But if you're a surviving spouse or partner, you may also have to replace the loss of expected income, which could include Social Security and pension benefits.

The Impact of
INCOME
TAXES


The higher your tax rate in retirement, the more you'll have to withdraw from your investments to meet your retirement income target.

Medicare Premiums
AND HEALTH
EXPENSES


At age 65, Social Security payments are reduced to cover premiums for Medicare Parts B and D and Medigap insurance. Then there are health-care costs not covered by Medicare — which could average $220,000 for a 65-year-old couple.

American Realty Investors Inc (ARL)


Overview

American Realty Investors, a New York Stock Exchange Company (NYSE: ARL), maintains 
              a commitment to greater shareholder value through the acquisition, 
              financing, operation and sale of real estate and real estate assets.			
American Realty is highly diverse in location, with a portfolio of properties strategically 
              located throughout the United States. Its holdings include apartments, 
              office buildings, retail centers and parcels of land. At the time 
              of purchase, acquisitions are often referred to as "undervalued" 
              or "underdeveloped." Under ARL ownership, value is added 
              through physical improvements as well as management improvements. 
              The result is increased income through higher rental and occupancy 
              rates and increased income.
ARL was formed 
              through the business combination of American Realty Trust, Inc. 
              and National Realty, L.P.

American Realty Investors, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Results






Business Wire




May 17, 2017 4:34 PM EDT













 


















































  American Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE:ARL), a Dallas-based real estate investment company, today reported results of operations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we reported a net loss applicable to common shares of $6.0 million or ($0.39) per diluted loss per share compared to a net loss applicable to common shares of $3.7 million or ($0.24) per diluted loss per share for the same period ended 2016. Included in the net loss from operations is non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of $6.3 million and $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.  The growth in revenue and corresponding improvement in Net Operating Income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 demonstrates the viability of our business strategy. Management will continue its plan for growth from its operating properties and expects to reinvest in areas that will complement this growth; further management will maintain strong attention to all details of its operations including appropriate expense controls.  Our ability to take advantage of lower-interest rate mortgages available has reduced our monthly obligations and increased cash flow within our multifamily portfolio.  Revenues  Rental and other property revenues were $31.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $2.6 million compared to the prior period revenues of $29.2 million. This change, by segment, is an increase in the apartment portfolio of $1.3 million, and an increase in the commercial portfolio of $1.3 million. The increase in our apartment portfolio was mainly due to the acquisition of new properties. Our apartment portfolio continues to thrive in the current economic conditions with occupancies averaging over 95%. We have been able to surpass expectations due to the high-quality product offered, strength of our management team and our commitment to our tenants. We are continuing to market our properties aggressively to attract new tenants and strive for continuous improvement of our properties in order to maintain our existing tenants.

A Real Estate Investment Location is a neighborhood or a set of neighborhoods where there are investment properties that produce positive cash flow after deducting all monthly expenses, including mortgage payments. 
Real Estate Investment Locations

 
HomeUnion has identified Real Estate Investment Locations that meet the cash flow requirement as well as a number of other criteria such as:

Employment
Median income
Area comps
Access to mass transit
Quality of schools
Employer diversity
Average tenancy 

We determines if a neighborhood fits the definition through extensive use of our proprietary algorithms and ‘boots on the ground’- some of these local property managers have more than 20 years in their location.
Properties tend to be in middle-class locations. High end neighborhoods don’t provide adequate cash flow, and lower priced neighborhoods lack a stable tenant base. We look for Return on Investment for our clients; which means finding properties with high rent-to-purchase-price ratios in economically viable areas.
And Now, Investing in Real Estate is As Simple
With HomeUnion it’s now easy to invest in real estate. You invest, we do the rest. Tell us your investment goals, and we’ll help you build a real estate investment plan to match your goals. Our experts will take care of the entire acquisition process as well as the ongoing management of the property. We’ll also provide you with market intelligence for buy, hold or sell decisions. Our goals are to maximize your returns, protect your assets and provide you with 100% transparency in the process. Learn how you can identify investment properties within a good investment location neighborhood. Download our Definitive Guide to Investment Properties.

Invest in 1031 Eligible PropertiesDefer Capital Gains on Your Real Estate Investment.Become a 1031 Investor 







What is a 1031 Exchange?
A 1031 exchange is a powerful wealth management tool. Real estate investors can defer their capital gains tax on the sale of a property if they reinvest the proceeds in another qualifying property under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1031.


 










1031 Exchange Benefits:


Defer capital gains taxes on the sale of your property.
Invest in cash flowing properties and look to receive monthly distributions.
Ensure certainty of closing and avoid property management headaches.
Diversify your portfolio with a broad range of geography and property types.



 









1031 Exchange Risks:


A 1031 Exchange is a complicated transaction. Investors should consult their tax professionals.
The underlying investments in Real Estate are Illiquid Investments.
Investors who fail to complete their 1031 exchange in the allowable time (typically 180 days) lose their capital gains tax protection.
Each investment has its own risks and the investor should review offering materials for a full review of those risks.

PPM Private Placement Memorandum Preparation | shicap






























Saturday, 22 July 2017






















            PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING (PPM) PREPARATION $2,750
PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM, OFFERING DOCUMENTS, REG D, REGULATION D, PPM, INVESTMENT OFFERING, RULE 506C, RULE 506B, BOND MEMORANDUM, EQUITY PLACEMENT, STOCK OFFERING, REAL ESTATE OFFERING, LLC OFFERING, LP OFFERING, LLP OFFERING,  
The cost of preparation includes all of the following documents: Private Placement Memorandum (PPM), Subscription Agreement, Investor Questionnaire and Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement.
Private Placement Memorandum (PPM): A completed Private Placement Memorandum is a document you give to an investor that will provide that investor with "all material information" needed to make an informed decision.This complies with the SEC - Regulation D requirements.
****Click here for sample PPM Offering Document 
Subscription Agreement: This is an 8 - 9 page document that the investor signs and returns to you with their investment check. The Subscription Agreement is your receipt that the investor confirms they have received the Offering Documents. In the event of litigation, it becomes your primary defense against any claims that you did not provide the investor with "all material information."
Investor Questionnaire: Each Investor will fall into 1 of 2 categories. "Accredited" or "Non-Accredited" Investor. You will be required to identify the specific category each of your investors meets. This document provides the basis for qualifying each potential investor.
Operating Agreement: If you are an (LLC) Limited Liability Company) an Operating Agreement must be given to each investor for signature execution and returned to you.
*Business Plan: We do not create the business plan. You must provide this document to us in an MS Word format for use as an exhibit in the PPM.
Important Information About Preparation
Most everyone needs to have a mechanism to find Investors in order to raise capital. Regulation D - Rule 506(c) provides that you may advertise with certain restrictions. 
This is very important. Your advertising will be limited to 130 characters in which to reach investor prospects. 
The first conversation we guide you through is what is in those 130 characters; because whatever it is - your success to finding investors will depend on it. Remember your entire Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) must comport with whatever the 130 characters read in your advertising. 
Though this may sound a little confusing once explained you will "get it." However, the important thing to remember is that your advertising will drive the prospects to read your documents and if your project reads well you should be able to close a percentage of the investor prospects responding to the advertising. 
When we first begin the PPM preparation, the initial first conversation we have with you is what is in the 130 characters because it will define your investor deal.
The offering documents must be given to any prospective investor that you speak with whether they invest or not.

The document belongs to the prospective investor and is not returned. Our PPM is a legend for all 50 states.


The PPM will be appropriate for your company structure whether LLC, C Corp or S Corp.


The Preparation of the Private Placement Memorandum, Subscription Agreement, and Investor Questionnaire can be a very complicated process depending on a number of factors.


Mr. Shields reviews with you many of the different options explaining the pros and cons of each so that ultimately each of your decisions is going to be made from an informed position. Assessing the benefit from the 35 years of Mr. Shields Wall Street experience as a New York Stock Exchange Member and CEO will prove critical in providing you advice and direction in succeeding. 


Some of the examples of the subjects we will cover with you. 

Investor Exit Options
Equity or debt and what it means to you  
Preferred -Common - Debentures
How to Solicit Investors or different methodologies in identifying and reaching out to investors
Pricing your offering
How much of the company should you offer investors?
What's the DEAL?
Offering amount
Complying with Federal Securities Laws - Regulation D (Reg. D)
Changes to your business plan
Options for Raising Capital  



 DISCOUNTS ARE AVAILABLE
We have some discounts that you can avail yourself such as if you do not need an Operating Agreement or choose to create your own you can subtract $300 from the pricing. Also, ask us for an invoice for the preparation of the Private Placement Memorandum which will provide you a detailed description of what you can expect including what other discount options may be available to you. There is no obligation for asking us for the invoice and having it will help you make a more informed decision as to whether to proceed or not.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
