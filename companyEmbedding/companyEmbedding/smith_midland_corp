					Full Description



Smith-Midland Corporation, incorporated on August 2, 1994, invents, develops, manufactures, markets, leases, licenses, sells and installs a range of precast concrete products for use in the construction, highway, utilities and farming industries, through its subsidiaries. The Company's precast and barrier rental customers are primarily general contractors and federal, state, and local transportation authorities located in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. It offers products, including SlenderWall, J-J Hooks Highway Safety Barrier, SoftSound, Sierra Wall and Beach Prisms erosion mitigating modules. The Company's precast subsidiaries also produce farm products, such as cattleguards and water and feed troughs, as well as custom order precast concrete products with various architectural surfaces, and generic highway sound barriers, retaining walls and utility vaults.Easi-Set SlenderWall Lightweight Construction PanelsThe SlenderWall system is a prefabricated exterior cladding system that is offered as an alternative to the cladding used for the exterior walls of buildings. The Company custom designs, manufactures, installs and licenses the SlenderWall exterior cladding system. The exterior of the SlenderWall system is produced in a range of architectural finishes, such as concrete, exposed stone, granite or thin brick.Easi-Set Sierra WallThe Easi-Set Sierra Wall (Sierra Wall) provides a sound and sight barrier for use alongside highways around residential, industrial and commercial properties. Sierra Wall is constructed of approximately four-inch thick, steel-reinforced concrete panels with an integral column creating a tongue and groove connection system. The Company designs and manufactures Sierra Wall components to conform to the specifications provided by the contractor. It also produces generic post and panel design sound barrier wall systems. These systems are constructed of steel or precast concrete columns (the Company manufactures the precast columns) with precast concrete panels, which slide down into the groove in each column. Sierra Wall is used primarily for highway projects as a noise barrier, as well as for residential purposes, such as privacy walls between homes, security walls or windbreaks, and for industrial or commercial purposes, such as to screen and protect shopping centers, industrial operations, institutions or highways.Easi-Set J-J Hooks Highway Safety BarrierThe Easi-Set J-J Hooks highway safety barriers (the J-J Hooks Barriers) are crash-tested, positively connected, safety barriers that the Company sells, rents, delivers, installs and licenses for use on roadways to separate lanes of traffic, either temporarily (free-standing, bolted or pinned) for construction work zone purposes or permanently for traffic control.

The utility vaults can be used to house equipment, such as cable, telephone or traffic signal equipment, and for underground storage. It also manufactures custom-built utility vaults for special needs.SoftSound Soundwall PanelsSoftSound soundwall panels utilize a wood aggregate absorptive material. The material is applied to the face of soundwall panels, which is used to absorb highway noise.Beach Prisms Erosion Control ModulesBeach Prisms is a shoreline erosion control product.
