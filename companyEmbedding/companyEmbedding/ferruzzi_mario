Purdue University


                  Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

The university was founded with the gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist, along with $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, and 150 acres (0.6 km²) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. In 1869, it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University, in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor.

The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Professor of food and nutrition
sciences Mario Ferruzzi will receive Purdue University's 2013 Agricultural
Research Award for his work in helping to improve food quality and human health
and to reduce chronic disease.  
The award is given each year to a faculty member in the
College of Agriculture with less than 18 years of experience beyond a doctoral
degree. It is for scientists who have demonstrated a high level of excellence
in research and made significant contributions to agriculture, natural
resources and quality of life for Indiana citizens. 
Ferruzzi has dual appointments in the College of Agriculture's
Department of Food Science and the College of Health and Human Sciences'
Department of Nutrition Science.
"Mario has made exceptional contributions to
understanding how food matrix and processing factors affect nutrient absorption
from our food, and his work can lead to the further development of functional
foods to improve human health," said Jay Akridge, Glenn W. Sample Dean of
Agriculture. "He is most deserving of our college's top research
award."
Ferruzzi
 will receive the award Monday (May 13) at 10:30 a.m. EDT in the Deans 
Auditorium at Pfendler Hall on the West Lafayette campus. 
Ferruzzi's work will help the food industry develop
products of improved nutritional and functional quality, said Karen Plaut,
associate dean and director of Agricultural Research at Purdue. 
"Dr. Ferruzzi's research has an impact on fundamental
and applied aspects of both food science and nutrition as he works to identify
food science strategies that will contribute to improving human health and
reducing chronic disease risk," she said.
Ferruzzi's expertise has helped him develop and apply
analytical methods for quantifying bioactive food components and phytochemicals
in food, and assessing their bioavailability and distribution to body tissues.
His findings have improved the understanding of the role that phytochemicals can
have on human health, including diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's
disease.
Ferruzzi said the award is an acknowledgement of the many
team efforts that have involved his work. 
"This is an individual award that is not individual
in any way," he said. "We don't write grants in isolation, we don't
do research in isolation, and we don't even get ideas in isolation anymore.
"Collectively, we can do a lot of really good things
together. I'm a prime example of that. I've made good decisions about the areas
I've worked on, about how we've worked on them and how we've pursued the
funding, and this award says good things about the collaborations I've been
lucky enough to be a part of. " 
After earning his master's degree in 1998 and Ph.D. in 2001
in food science and nutrition at Ohio State University, Ferruzzi spent nearly
three years in product research and development with Nestlé in the U.S. and
Switzerland before joining the Purdue faculty in 2004.

Page ContentAg Research Spotlight:
Mario Ferruzzi

"As the analytical tools get better, the questions get more complex and deep." –Mario Ferruzzi


The Ag Research Spotlight shines each month on an individual whose work reflects our commitment to the six strategic themes that guide Agricultural Research at Purdue. Our spotlight for October 2012 underscores the theme, “People enhancing food and health.”

THE RESEARCHER
As an undergraduate chemistry major at Duke University, Ferruzzi found summer employment with the North Carolina State University Seafood Laboratory. There he learned a little about food processing and found application for his basic science. After completing his doctorate in Food Science and Nutrition at The Ohio State University in 2001, Ferruzzi worked for Nestlé, first in Ohio and  then at the company’s Research Center in Switzerland. When he joined the Purdue faculty in 2004, he brought industry-focused relevance to his research. Food science is a discipline that exists in a university because of its stakeholders, the food industry and consumers, he says.

THE RESEARCH
Ferruzzi’s research focuses on two main classes of plant-derived compounds, polyphenols and natural pigments (carotenoids and chlorophylls), that are associated with human health benefits. His team wants to understand how these compounds are distributed in the food supply and how they get from the food into our bodies (bioavailability). He further explores how they react to food formulation and processing, how they are delivered to the consumer, and ultimately how the human body utilizes them.

APPLICATIONS
Understanding how food delivers health-promoting compounds and what the body does with them can lead to improved recommendations for consumers. A second purpose has to do with the design, validation and implementation of food products. “Our application point is to guide the development of food products to optimize the way the body uses these foods,” Ferruzzi says. “We want to help the industry mature and grow with sound science.”​

TOOLS OF THE TRADE
“Technology is critical. You can ask the questions, but you have to have the tools to answer them. I couldn’t do it without the complex analytical systems I have available to me in my lab and more broadly at Purdue.”

ADAPTATION
In the current funding environment, Ferruzzi believes he must continually adapt his research to maintain both relevance and competitiveness. Working with colleagues at Purdue’s International Food Technology Center, for example, he has been studying products made with bio-fortified maize and sorghum targeted to at-risk consumers in developing countries. “I’ve been very fortunate in this work to have had tremendous collaborators,” he says. “Eight years ago, I never imagined working in foods for developing countries. Now it’s an exciting part of what I might be able to do long term."​​​

More information about Mario Ferruzzi
Dr. Mario Ferruzzi’s research interests focus on two areas: provitamin A carotenoid and phenolics. Within these compound classes, he looks at the role of the food matrix in delivery of micronutrients and phytochemicals. His lab explores the interactions between plant phytochemicals and macro-nutrients (proteins and carbohydrates) and their impact to product quality and health promoting properties in humans. This includes developing insights into the role these interactions play in modifying nutrient availability, gut microbial communities and markers of disease. Prior to joining PHHI, Ferruzzi spent 12 years at Purdue University.
