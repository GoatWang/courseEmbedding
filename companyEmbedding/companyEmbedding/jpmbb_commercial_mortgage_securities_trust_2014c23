      Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2014-C23
    





September 21, 2016 04:47 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities Trust (JPMBB), series 2014-C23 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates. A full list of rating actions follows at the 
      end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to the overall stable performance of the 
      underlying collateral pool. There have been no material changes to the 
      pool since issuance.
    

      Fitch modeled losses of 4.5% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 4.4%. The pool has experienced no 
      realized losses to date. Fitch has designated four loans (1.9%) as Fitch 
      Loans of Concern, which includes two specially serviced assets (0.7%).
    

      As of the August 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 0.9% to $1.38 billion from $1.39 billion at 
      issuance. No loans are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently 
      affecting class NR.
    

      The largest loan in the pool, 17 State Street, (7.8% of the pool), is 
      secured by a 564,893 square foot (sf) class A office building located in 
      New York. The 42-story building was constructed in 1988 and is situated 
      adjacent to Battery Park, on the southern tip of Manhattan's Financial 
      District. The largest tenants include IP Soft Inc. (17%), expiry 2022, 
      Fidessa Corporation (15%), expiry 2017; Alphadyne Asset Management LLC 
      (5%), expiry 2026. The property is 97.3% occupied as of June 2016 with 
      an average rent of $54.29 per square foot (psf). There is approximately 
      8% upcoming rollover in 2016 and 17% in 2017. Per Reis as of the second 
      quarter (2Q) 2016, the downtown New York office market vacancy is 10.8% 
      with average asking rent $53.38 psf. The most recent servicer-reported 
      debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 3.18x as of June 2016.
    

      Two loans (0.7%) were transferred to special servicing in July 2016 due 
      to payment default. The loans are not crossed but have a related 
      borrower. The properties are both Microtel Inn & Suites consisting of 85 
      rooms each located in St. Clairsville, OH and Triadelphia, WV. Both 
      properties are located within the Marcellus Shale Formation oil and gas 
      market in West Virginia and Ohio areas. The special servicer is in the 
      process of reviewing the file to determine the appropriate workout 
      strategy.
    

      The largest Fitch Loan of Concern (1.2%) is secured by two multifamily 
      properties totaling 440 units located in Longview, TX and Tyler, TX. 
      properties have a combined occupancy of 91.4% as of June 2016. The 
      Longview property has suffered a decline in occupancy from 93% at 
      issuance to 75% as of June 2016 and the Tyler property is 91% occupied 
      as of June 2016. The portfolio's most recent DSCR, as of the (trailing 
      12 month) TTM June 2016, has declined to 1.26x from 1.64x at issuance. 
      The decline in performance is due to higher vacancies and tenant 
      concessions.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Fitch assumed 
      conservative losses on the specially serviced assets as updated 
      appraisal values are not yet available. Given the smaller size of these 
      assets, losses are not expected to impact the rated classes. Due to the 
      recent issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does 
      not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material 
      economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level 
      metrics.

      shortfalls on the related componentized mortgage loan.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 65 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 101 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and 
the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which 
is largely driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's 
assessment of the severity of loss upon a default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's LTV ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.55x is higher than the 2007 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's 
Stressed DSCR of 0.92 is in-line the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 0.92X.




Moody's Trust LTV ratio of 113.5% is higher than the 
2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6%. 





Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level 
diversity when selecting a ratings approach.




With respect to loan level diversity, the pool's loan level 
(includes cross collateralized and cross defaulted loans) Herfindahl Index 
is 27. The transaction's loan level diversity is in-line 
with the Herfindahl scores found in most multi-borrower transactions 
issued since 2009. With respect to property level diversity, 
the pool's property level Herfindahl Index is 29. The transaction's 
property diversity profile is in-line with the indices calculated 
in most multi-borrower transactions issued since 2009. 




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.26, which is in-line 
with the indices calculated in most multi-borrower transactions 
since 2009. 




This deal is structured with super-senior Aaa classes having 30% 
credit enhancement. Although the additional enhancement offered 
to the senior most certificate holders provides additional protection 
against pool loss, the super-senior structure is credit negative 
for the carved out Class A-S certificate which immediately supports 
the super-senior classes. If the support certificate were 
to take a loss, the loss would have the potential to be quite large 
on a percentage basis relative to Moody's idealized Aaa (sf) loss 
target. Thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability 
of default in recognition that their loss-given default is higher. 





Given the composition of the subject pool, Moody's is unable 
to assign a Aaa (sf) rating for a support certificate having a credit 
enhancement of 23.625% and 6.375% certificate 
thickness (30.000% detachment). Although the severity 
profile (reflected by the certificate's thickness) is better than 
Moody's idealized target for structured ratings, the default 
profile (reflected by the stated credit enhancement) is commensurate with 
a Aa1 (sf) rating. The profile of each loss component in tandem 
is not strong enough to uplift Class A-S to a Aaa (sf) grade.




The principal methodology used in this rating was " Moody's Approach to 
Rating U.S. CMBS Conduit Transactions" published in September 
2000. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology. 




Moody's analysis employs the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v2.64 
which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted 
loan level proceeds derived from Moody's loan level DSCR and LTV ratios. 
Major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure, 
property type, sponsorship and diversity. Moody's analysis 
also uses the CMBS IO calculator version 1.1 which references the 
following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the published 
methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit estimates; 
original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds 
the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and IO type corresponding 
to an IO type as defined in the published methodology.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
15%, and 23%, the model-indicated rating 
for the currently rated Aaa (sf) Super Senior class would be Aaa, 
Aa1, and Aa2, respectively; for the Aa1 (sf) rated class 
A-S would be Aa2, Aa3, and A2, respectively. 
Parameter Sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of 
the security might migrate over time; rather they are designed to 
provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change 
if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed. 
The analysis assumes that the deal has not aged. Parameter Sensitivities 
only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated 
standpoint. Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration 
in the ratings process, so the actual ratings that would be assigned 
in each case could vary from the information presented in the Parameter 
Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer 
at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently 
verified by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement 
of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, 
inducement or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities 
or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection 
with any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's received and took into account one or more third-party 
assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a 
neutral impact on the credit rating. 




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF381912.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




As the section on loss and cash flow analysis describes, Moody's 
quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors 
contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood 
of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. Moody's 
weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of 
the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com

MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

Approximately $1.14 Billion of Structured Securities Affected


New York, September 09, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded one class and affirmed the ratings 
on 11 classes in JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-C23 
as follows:




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Sep

Cl. X-A, Affirmed Aa1 (sf); previously on Sep 
10, 2015 Affirmed Aa1 (sf)




*Reflects Loan Specific Class (U-Haul Portfolio 5)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the nine P&I classes, Classes A-1 through 
C, were affirmed because the transaction's key metrics, including 
Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed 
debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl Index 
(Herf), are within acceptable ranges.




The ratings on the IO class, Class X-A, was affirmed 
based on the credit performance of its referenced classes.




The rating on the exchangeable class, Class EC, was affirmed 
based on the credit performance of its exchangeable classes.




The rating on the non-pooled rake class, Class UH5, 
was upgraded based on improvement in the loan's key metrics, including 
Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and Moody's stressed debt 
service coverage ratio (DSCR), as a result of paydowns from loan 
amortization. The rake class is supported by the subordinate debt 
associated with the U-Haul Self Storage Portfolio Loan.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.4% 
of the current balance, compared to 4.6% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 4.3% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 4.6% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 27, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the August 17th, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate pooled certificate balance has decreased by 1.0% 
to $1.342 billion from $1.355 billion at securitization. 
The pooled certificates are collateralized by 65 mortgage loans ranging 
in size from less than 1% to 8% of the pool, with 
the top ten loans constituting 51% of the pool. There are 
no loans with investment-grade structured credit assessments or 
that have defeased.




Six loans, constituting 8% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans that 
meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the CRE 
Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part of Moody's 
ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency reviews the watchlist 
to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool and there are two loans in 
special servicing, representing $9.9 million (less 
than 1% of the pool). Both loans are secured by a Microtel 
Inn and Suites hotel. One Hotel is located in St. Clairsville, 
Ohio and the other in Triadelphia, West Virginia. Both loans 
transferred to special servicing in July 2016 due to payment default. 
The special servicer is reviewing both loans to determine the workout 
strategy going forward.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 100% of the 
pool and partial year 2016 operating results for 85% of the pool. 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 111%, compared to 
113% at last review. Moody's conduit component excludes 
loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and CTL loans, 
and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's net cash flow 
(NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 11.7% to the 
most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's value 
reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.4%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.57X and 0.95X, 
respectively, compared to 1.56X and 0.92X at last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 23% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the 17 State Street Loan ($105.0 Million 
-- 7.8% of the pool), which represents 
a pari passu portion of a $180.0 million mortgage loan. 
The loan is secured by a 42-story, Class-A office 
tower located in downtown New York, New York. The tower contains 
560,210 square feet (SF) of net rentable area and floor-to-ceiling 
windows overlooking both Battery Park and the New York Harbor. 
As of June 2016, the property was 97% leased, compared 
to 91% at last review. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 
119% and 0.79X, respectively, the same as at 
last review.




The second largest loan is the Columbus Square Portfolio ($103.8 
million -- 7.7% of the pool), which 
represents a pari passu portion of a $400.0 million mortgage 
loan. The loan is secured by five mixed-use buildings containing 
approximately 500,000 SF and located on the Upper West Side neighborhood 
of New York, NY. The property contains 31 condominium units 
at 775, 795, 805, 808 Columbus Avenue and 801 Amsterdam 
Avenue. The retail component, which contains approximately 
276,000 SF is anchored by a Whole Foods, TJ Maxx, and 
Michaels. All buildings were built between 2007 through 2008. 
As of March 2016, the property was 96% leased, essentially 
the same as at last review. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 130% 
and 0.67X, respectively, the same as at same as at 
last review.




The third largest loan is the Wyvernwood Apartments Loan ($103.0 
million -- 7.7% of the pool). The loan 
is secured by a Class C residential property with the improvements developed 
in phases during 1938 and 1965. The collateral structures primarily 
consists of 151 two-story apartment buildings situated on approximately 
61 acres of land. Amenities include fully equipped kitchens, 
computer lab, laundry facilities, open landscaped grounds 
and a playground. As of March 2016, the property was 99% 
leased, the same as at last review. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 120% and 0.79X, respectively, the same 
as at last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.

NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Approximately $1.299 Billion of Structured Securities Affected


New York, September 10, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on 12 classes in JPMBB 
Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-C23 as follows: 





Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct

Cl. X-A, Affirmed Aa1 (sf); previously on Oct 
2, 2014 Definitive Rating Assigned Aa1 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the nine P&I classes A-1 through C were affirmed 
because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value 
(LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within 
acceptable ranges.




The ratings on the IO class X-A was affirmed based on the credit 
performance of its referenced classes.




The rating on the exchangeable class, class EC was affirmed based 
on the credit performance of its exchangeable classes.




The rating on the non-pooled rake class, class UH5 is due 
to sufficient credit support for the current rating. The rake class 
is supported by the subordinate debt associated with the Uhaul Self Storage 
Portfolio Loan.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.6% 
of the current balance. Moody's base expected loss plus realized 
losses is now 4.6% of the original pooled balance. 
Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit 
and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at


http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 27, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the August 19th, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate pooled certificate balance has decreased by 0.4% 
to $1.350 billion from $1.355 billion at securitization. 
The certificates are collateralized by 65 mortgage loans ranging in size 
from less than 1% to 7.8% of the pool, with 
the top ten loans constituting 51% of the pool. There are 
no loans with investment-grade structured credit assessments or 
that have defeased.




One loan, constituting 0.5% of the pool, is 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool and there are no loans in 
special servicing.




Moody's received full or partial year 2014 operating results for 57% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 113%, 
compared to 114% at securitization. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 1.5% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.4%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.56X and 0.92X, 
respectively, compared to 1.55X and 0.92X at securitization. 
Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 23% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the 17 State Street Loan ($105 Million -- 
7.8% of the pool), which represents a 58% portion 
of a $180 million pari passu loan. The loan is secured by 
a 42-story, Class-A office tower located in downtown 
New York, NY. The tower contains 560,210 square feet 
(SF) of net rentable area and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking 
both Battery Park and the New York Harbor. As of June 19, 
2014, the property was 90.7% occupied by 54 tenants. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 119% and 0.79X, 
respectively, the same as at securitzation.




The second largest loan is the Columbus Square Portfolio ($103.8 
million -- 7.7% of the pool), which represents 
a 26% portion of a $400 million pari passu loan. 
The loan is secured by five condominium buildings containing office and 
retail space located in the Upper West Side section of New York, 
New York. Approximately 56% of the net rentable area of 
the collateral is comprised of anchored retail space. Some retail 
tenants include Whole Foods, TJ Maxx, Michael's and Sephora. 
All buildings were built between 2007 through 2008 and collectively contain 
almost 500,000 SF of rentable area. As of July 2014, 
the property was 96% occupied with 23 tenants. Moody's LTV 
and stressed DSCR are 130% and 0.67X, respectively, 
the same as at securitization.




The third largest loan is the Wyvernwood Apartments Loan ($103 
million -- 7.6% of the pool) which is a Class C residential 
property with the improvements developed in phases during 1938 and 1965. 
The collateral structures primarily consists of 151 two-story apartment 
buildings situated on approximately 61 acres of land. Amenities 
include fully equipped kitchens, computer lab, laundry facilities, 
open landscaped grounds and a playground. As of May 2015, 
the property was 98% leased. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 120% and 0.79X, respectively, the same as 
at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB), series 2014-C23 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are due to the overall stable performance of the underlying collateral pool. There have been no material changes to the pool since issuance.Fitch modeled losses of 4.5% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 4.4%. The pool has experienced no realized losses to date. Fitch has designated four loans (1.9%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes two specially serviced assets (0.7%).As of the August 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.9% to $1.38 billion from $1.39 billion at issuance. No loans are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting class NR.The largest loan in the pool, 17 State Street, (7.8% of the pool), is secured by a 564,893 square foot (sf) class A office building located in New York. The 42-story building was constructed in 1988 and is situated adjacent to Battery Park, on the southern tip of Manhattan's Financial District. The largest tenants include IP Soft Inc. (17%), expiry 2022, Fidessa Corporation (15%), expiry 2017; Alphadyne Asset Management LLC (5%), expiry 2026. The property is 97.3% occupied as of June 2016 with an average rent of $54.29 per square foot (psf). There is approximately 8% upcoming rollover in 2016 and 17% in 2017. Per Reis as of the second quarter (2Q) 2016, the downtown New York office market vacancy is 10.8% with average asking rent $53.38 psf. The most recent servicer-reported debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 3.18x as of June 2016.Two loans (0.7%) were transferred to special servicing in July 2016 due to payment default. The loans are not crossed but have a related borrower. The properties are both Microtel Inn & Suites consisting of 85 rooms each located in St. Clairsville, OH and Triadelphia, WV. Both properties are located within the Marcellus Shale Formation oil and gas market in West Virginia and Ohio areas. The special servicer is in the process of reviewing the file to determine the appropriate workout strategy.The largest Fitch Loan of Concern (1.2%) is secured by two multifamily properties totaling 440 units located in Longview, TX and Tyler, TX. properties have a combined occupancy of 91.4% as of June 2016. The Longview property has suffered a decline in occupancy from 93% at issuance to 75% as of June 2016 and the Tyler property is 91% occupied as of June 2016. The portfolio's most recent DSCR, as of the (trailing 12 month) TTM June 2016, has declined to 1.26x from 1.64x at issuance. The decline in performance is due to higher vacancies and tenant concessions.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable.

Commercial Financing
If you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing, you may find it intimidating. That is certainly the case for most first-time commercial borrowers. Commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost. But getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique.

The Basics of Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property. A business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns, which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose. Commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest -- commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable -- until the loan is paid in full. Moreover, a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term, with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender. 

What distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower. Unlike residential mortgages, which are geared toward the individual and 1-4 unit residential dwellings, commercial property financing is designed for business entities -- both for profit and not-for-profit -- to mortgage nearly any type of retail, office, industrial, multi-unit (5+) unit residential, or just about any other commercially zoned real property.

Because of these property and borrower characteristics, commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry. The limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena. If a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure, it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house. To compensate for the greater risk, commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements, and loan terms are shorter (typically a maximum of 25/30 years). 

Commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower, but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards, a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firm's principals may be used to compensate. 

A final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close. Not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages, but nearly every aspect of the "due diligence" phase -- from valuation, to title, to underwriting -- is more complicated and, therefore, more costly. 

An Illustration: The "Vanilla" Commercial Mortgage Loan

To help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice, here are the major characteristics of a standard "vanilla" commercial mortgage loan.

Debt Coverage Ratio

Commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower. The lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Generally, commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from 1.1 to 1.25 times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment is $2,000, the property should be producing $2,200 to $2,500 after all expenses are paid. 

Down Payment

Commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of 25% down. A higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk, newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability.

Prepayment Penalties

Commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties, that is, a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made. For example, the fee might be 5% of the outstanding balance during the first year, 4% the second year, and so on, with no penalty after the fifth year. For obvious reasons, prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to -- or be able to -- own the property long enough to avoid them.

Although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages, you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them. Generally, deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk. For example, an up-front fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty, while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment.
Where to Go For Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the U.S. The three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are:
1. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities2. Regional Banks3. Private Equity Companies - i.e. Life Insurance Companies / Pension Manager / Hedge Funds4. Specialty Finance Companies - i.e. Third-Party ("Conduit") and Hard Money Lenders
Commercial Mortgage Brokers
Naturally, most business owners turn to banks -- particularly ones with whom they have established relationships -- for their commercial real estate financing. On the one hand, banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates; on the other, they are the most rigid in their lending. Many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries. They also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources.

Conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks. Because their money comes from private sources, insurance companies, and commercial lines of credit, they can be much more flexible in their lending. You will find that hard money lenders, in particular, will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers -- all at a cost: Hard Money Lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks.

For larger capital needs, companies often turn to private equity companies. Private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project. The equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide -- normally no more than 75 percent of costs. So, for a $5 million project, commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than $3.8 million, leaving $1.2 million in the equity range for the borrower to fund. If the borrowing entity has $200,000 in cash to put into the project, it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining $1 million. Private Equity Companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative, flexible financing solutions, but they expect a good return on investment, so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders. Commercial mortgage brokers don't fund loans directly. Instead, a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees. A good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs, giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own. As an added benefit, commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging, making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy. Using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in up-front fees, a higher than market interest rate, or both. A good one, though, will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your company's specific needs at a competitive rate.

With so many choices, it is important that you shop around, but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate. As is the case in residential mortgages, commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next. But with such a big financial commitment at stake, unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing, you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan. 

Regardless of the source you ultimately use, a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome.

Preparation: The Key to a Smooth Commercial Mortgage Lending Process

When you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender, some advance preparation will serve you well. The complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to "rate shop" multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone -- at least, not with any reliability. 
Any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information, which is needed to give you an informed, accurate decision about your company's ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect: 1. Year-to-date profit & loss statement and balance sheet 2. Three years business income tax returns 3. Projected cash flow for the next 36 months
4. Personal Financial Statement and Resume for the Principal5. Property information
6. Written business plan
Having these items available will not only make your task easier, it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request. Be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information. You could be in for nasty surprises later!

Commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company. Unlike other types of credit for business, which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period, commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with long-term, asset based financing, at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment.
