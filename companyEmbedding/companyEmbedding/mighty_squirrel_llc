The First Protein-Focused Beer, Mighty Squirrel, Is Now on Shelves in Boston

Mighty Squirrel founders Henry Manice (left) and Naveen Pawar (right)
Beer and sports go hand-in-hand, right? That’s the idea behind Henry Manice and Naveen Pawar’s newly released Mighty Squirrel beer. The brew, which hit shelves in Boston on June 26 (and sold out within 24 hours), is the first beer ever to contain up to 5 grams of protein.

“We wanted a brew that would fit in better at the finish line.”

“We loved playing tennis with friends and enjoying celebratory beers afterwards, but we wanted a brew that would fit in better at the finish line,” co-founder Manice told BostInno. Inspired by this, the two founders, who met working as product managers at a spinal implant company, set out to invent a flavorful, first-of-its-kind craft beer with more protein.
“It was definitely a risk, but it was thrilling to just go for it,” Manice says of leaving his stable job to pursue Mighty Squirrel beer full-time. “We knew we wanted to give it a shot, and it has definitely been the roller coaster of our lives since Naveen and I starting working on this full time in August 2013.”
As for the beer’s unique name, the co-founder tells us that “Mighty Squirrel” originated from the founders’ code word for protein. “We never thought ‘squirrel’ was actually going to be part of our brand name,” Manice said. “But after years of saying squirrel this and squirrel that, we decided, well, why not use squirrel in our company name since it means something to us, plus we thought it could be a fun name for a beer.”
Mighty Squirrel
The beer itself comes in two different varieties: Mighty Squirrel Original, a Vienna lager that is complex with bready, caramel, and citrus notes, plus a hint of honey and five grams of protein; and Mighty Squirrel Light, a light lager that is clean and crisp with citrus, honey notes and five grams of protein. For comparison, a Sam Adams Lager contains two grams of protein while a Budweiser beer contains only one gram. Both beers, Manice said, are brewed with the highest quality malt and hops from Germany. “We do not use adjuncts such as rice, corn, enzymes, or sugars,” he added.
“Most all food and beverage companies have come out with products that have more protein due to consumer demand,” Manice said. “We hope people enjoy our craft beer with more protein, and we hope people have many ‘mighty moments’ to celebrate (such as finishing a 5K, a marathon, etc.) as that is what we are all about.”
To create these “mighty moments,” Mighty Squirrel will not only be getting involved with athletic groups in the area but will also be creating its own events. “Our ‘squirrel runs’ will consist of thirty or forty people running a few miles through Boston and ending up at a cool bar for a beer, or a water, whichever you prefer!” Manice said.
Currently, the two founders are based out of WeWork, while their Mighty Squirrel beer is being brewed at the Von Trapp Brewery in Stowe, Vermont. “It is very expensive to build your own brewery so having a brewing partner made a lot of sense for us at this stage,” Manice said. “Someday we hope to be in a position to have our own Mighty Squirrel brewery.”
In the future, expect to see Mighty Squirrel in numerous fridges throughout the Boston area – as Manice said that the beer company plans to scale up in and around Boston beginning mid-July.
If you’re looking to try Mighty Squirrel, you can find it at Quality Mart at 21 Massachusetts Ave. in Boston, and at the restaurant Miracle of Science near MIT.
