Who We Are








Vectrus headquarters, Colorado Springs, CO.
Vectrus is a leading provider of global service solutions in the areas of Information Technology and Network Communication services, and Facility and Logistics services.
Since 1945, we've succeeded by tackling some of the world's most difficult challenges. Our management team averages 28 years of experience in the military and industry, and our globally diverse workforce, including more than 35% of our employees reporting a military background, provide us with highly resourceful and experienced problem solvers. We currently operate in 18 countries across four continents, in both stable and unstable environments, employing approximately 5,000+ people and managing more than 7,250 subcontractor personnel.
Vectrus brings together the best people and performance needed to get the job done. We are "true to your mission."
Our Strengths
We create value through operational excellence, cost leadership and superior program performance. Our core strengths include:

Proven Strong Performance and Enduring Relationships.  Our strong customer relationships with strategically essential customers, some of which have lasted more than 30 years, enable us to develop deep customer knowledge and translate our mission understanding into successful program execution.
Rapid and Agile Global Operating Capabilities. Our contracts require quick start-up in complex locations for customer missions that cannot be disrupted. This expeditionary posture demonstrates our aptitude at interpreting and complying with the varied, complex, changing and often unpredictable requirements of foreign laws and business environments.
Attractive Business Dynamics. A highly variable cost structure allows our company to adapt to changing market conditions and contract structures. We successfully manage cost-reimbursable and firm-fixed-price type contracts, contracts that include elements of both, as well as low price-technically acceptable contracts due to our insightful bid strategy and outstanding operational capability.
Integrated Service Offerings. The efficient integration of our capabilities allows us to act as the prime contractor more often, makes us more cost competitive, increases value for our stakeholders, and allows us to effectively support customer missions. Additionally, our workforce has the technical expertise that win new contracts, including more than 3,000 technical certifications in the IT area and more than 35% holding an active security clearance.
Culture of Compliance and Certified Processes. We are disciplined in our approach to monitoring and controlling compliance with U.S. government regulations, reducing legal and reputational risk which gives us a competitive advantage.  We hold certifications in areas including quality management system (ISO 9001), occupational health and safety management system (OHSAS 18001) and IT service management system (ISO 20000). In addition, we maintain a Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) maturity level 3 appraisals for our network communication services.

The Vectrus Difference
Vectrus is positioned for success due to our deep understanding of customer needs, our rapid and global operating capabilities, and our resourcefulness to deliver the highest-value solutions on a cost-effective basis. This is how we do it:
Customer Focus. We understand what the customer really wants; we hear the voice of the customer.
Operational Excellence. Compliant, certified processes; we are engineered to win.
Program Performance. Our teams are responsible, responsive and deliver results.
Cost Leadership. We are high value and we earn the contract every day.
Honorable Values. We serve with integrity, steadfast respect and 100% responsibility. We are always true to our word.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Veterans









Vectrus values the specialized knowledge, leadership and discipline that are the hallmark of our transitioning military personnel.  Veterans find a smooth transition to a culture that has a nearly 70-year record of exceptional performance in defense and government services. As a team, our employees bring diverse experiences in the military and business worlds that contribute to our success.
Military Experience is a Plus    
Military experience provides valuable leadership skills and an understanding of our military customer’s needs and the environments in which we operate, which helps us develop superior products and services. Being comfortable working overseas and familiar with the military is also an advantage for our many employees who work on government contracts. Vectrus employees work in partnership with the military and government agencies, providing support for logistics, communications, engineering, equipment repair, vehicle maintenance, food services, IT, security, construction and general base or facility support. Most such service jobs are on or around military bases or government installations. Opportunities include management, administrative, and supervisory positions as well as areas that can be as specialized as base security or locksmith. 
 
Veterans make up a very important part of our workforce. More than 35 percent of our team report a military background. At some Vectrus locations the percentage of employees with a military background can be as high as 70-80 percent. Administrative departments within Vectrus such as Human Resources, Environmental Safety & Health, Training, and Finance also have many veterans in the workforce. As a team, our employees bring diverse experiences in the military and business worlds that strongly contribute to our success.
Planning Your Transition
Even if you aren’t sure when you will leave the military, it’s good to educate yourself when you have the time and begin your plans well in advance. Many military installations offer a Transition Assistance Program (TAP) or ACAP program that can include workshops, job search and other related resources. Take advantage of these by attending workshops or making an appointment with a transition counselor. It’s also a good idea to get information about Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits. Keep in mind that a transition is stressful, so plan ahead and keep your family up to date about what is happening.
 
Finding a Good Match
When searching for a job, be sure to consider the full range of skills and experiences you gained in the military. For example, you may have had secondary duties involving training, safety, or other areas that might make you a candidate for a variety of positions. A wide range of experience is valuable for the many contracts we serve. A recruiter can help you understand how your experience matches up with possible opportunities.
 
Reservists should ask about salary and continuation of insurance for those who are called to active duty. We will be happy to answer any questions you might have.
Military Spouses are Encouraged to Apply
We’re a military-friendly company that serves the military, so veterans and military family members have a strong presence in our workforce. We appreciate the sacrifices you make as a military spouse and we think you’ll feel at home as a member of the Vectrus team. Vectrus is a dynamic company with constantly changing opportunities around the world as well as an employee development program that will help you advance your career. We invite you to search through our career opportunities, and while there, please consider creating a profile and alert so you can be notified of opportunities that match your interests.

FAQ







  
 If I applied for a position when you were Exelis, do you still have my application? 

Yes, we still have your application.  However, we recommend that you set up a new profile in the 'Search Jobs' area located on the 'Work for Us' page, so you can set up job alerts for future Vectrus positions that may be of interest to you.

  

 Why does Vectrus use an all online application system? 

Vectrus uses an online applicant tracking system to better manage the candidate and hiring process and to remain in compliance with U.S. Government hiring guidelines. We receive a large volume of submissions each year and want to give each candidate the attention and consideration that they deserve. By applying online, your resume is immediately entered into our database making it searchable by all of our recruiters. If you highlight a position(s) of interest, your application is sent directly to the appropriate recruiter for review. This online database allows you to set up your own personal profile that you can visit as often as you like to update information or apply to additional jobs without having to complete a new profile each time.

  

 What employment opportunities are currently available at Vectrus? 

To view our current employment opportunities, search our job postings. You can use the search fields provided or click on the View All button to review listings of all jobs.

  

 How do I submit a resume? 

Each job posting you view will have a button that allows you to apply using our online response form. Fill in the required information, click submit and your resume will become part of our searchable database.  Submitting your resume more than once for the same position will NOT increase your chances of being contacted. We will contact you if your skills and qualifications match a position we are trying to fill.

  

 Why do I have to submit my resume electronically? 

We receive thousands of resumes at Vectrus each year. Resumes received via our online response form reach the database almost instantaneously.  Hard and soft copy resumes will not be accepted in order to remain in compliance with U.S. Government hiring guidelines.

  

 What should I do if I don't have an e-mail address? 

You can create an e-mail address free of charge at Hotmail.com.

  

 Can I apply to more than one position at a time? 

Yes, our site allows you to apply to more than one position. Please login to the system and follow the application process.

  

 How can I check the status of my application(s) or speak to a recruiter directly? 

Vectrus offers an online application status check session with recruiters once a month via our online chat session. Please visit the Vectrus chat session page for a schedule of future dates and times.

  

 What is a "source" and why am I required to select one? 

The source lets us know where you saw the position advertised or how you heard about the position. There is a source drop down menu that you are required to choose from when you submit a resume via our online response form. Please use the drop-down menu to choose from a list of sources.

  

 I'd like to include a cover letter with my resume, addressed to the appropriate individual. How can I find out the name of the appropriate individual? 

All resumes are received in a central database. It is not necessary to address a cover letter to a specific individual. If you would like to include a cover letter, you can paste it in the resume text field after the text of your resume or in the cover letter box provided.

  

 Why am I prompted to fill out additional information when I apply for some employment opportunities but not for others? 

If we have additional requirements for a specific position or need additional information from you, we will include these screening questions in the application process. These questions help us to determine if you are a strong match for the position you are applying for. Regardless, your resume will still enter our searchable database of resumes and may be considered for another position we are recruiting for.

  

 How do I know if you received my resume via the online response form? 

You will receive a confirmation message on the site that confirms your resume has been successfully submitted. A follow up e-mail will also be sent to your e-mail address to confirm your resume was received.

  

 Will I be notified if the job is filled or if I make it to the next step in the interview process? 

If you received the confirmation message after submitting your resume, you can be sure we received your resume. If your skills and qualifications strongly match, a recruiter will contact you. Due to the high volume of submittals we will only contact those candidates whose skills and qualifications most closely suit our needs.

  

 How long are the job postings generally on the web site? 

A position remains on our web site until it is filled.

  

 I have requested my password but never received an e-mail to reset my password. What went wrong? 

Ensure you check all email accounts, often time users have multiple emails addresses and check an incorrect email account. If that’s not the case, please check your junk email folder.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  16.10 (07/28/17)      EPS (TTM)  $2.15      Market Cap $370.76 M     Shares Outstanding 10.90 M     Public Float 10.63 M     Yield VEC has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 122,250     Change from Last  1.84%      Percent of Float 1.15%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.04      Net Money Flow ($)  25,316    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.
