Performance Metrics





Main Risks

					Dividend Risk: There is no guarantee that dividend-paying companies will continue to pay, or increase, their dividend.Equity Risk: Equity funds are subject generally to market, market sector, market liquidity, issuer and investment style risks, among other factors, to varying degrees, all of which are more fully described in the fund's prospectus.Foreign Investment Risk: To the extent the fund invests in foreign securities, its performance will be influenced by political, social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign companies. These special risks include exposure to currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political instability, and differing auditing and legal standards.Growth Risk: Investors often expect growth companies to increase their earnings at a certain rate. If these expectations are not met, investors can punish the stocks inordinately, even if earnings do increase. In addition, growth stocks may lack the dividend yield that may cushion stock prices in market downturns.

The performance data quotes represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Yield, share price and investment return fluctuate and an investor’s shares may be worth more or less than original cost upon redemption. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Click above for month-end returns.The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Municipal Bond Index covers the USD-denominated long-term tax-exempt bond market.The total return performance figures presented for Class I shares of the fund represent the performance of the fund's Class A for periods prior to December 15, 2008, the inception date for Class I shares, and the performance of Class I, respectively, from that inception date. Performance reflects the applicable class' distribution/servicing fees since the inception date. Had these fees and expenses been reflected for periods prior, performance would have been different. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors.

Performance Metrics





Main Risks

					Bond Risk: Bonds are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity, call and market risks, to varying degrees. Generally, all other factors being equal, bond prices are inversely related to interest-rate changes and rate increases can cause price declines.State Risk: Investing primarily in a single state may make the fund's portfolio securities more sensitive to risks specific to the state.
