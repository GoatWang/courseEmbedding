 The ResellerRatings Elite Program Recognizes Excellence in Customer Satisfaction
Our Elite Program recognizes excellence in customer satisfaction.  To display the
        ResellerRatings Elite badge, companies must meet stringent ratings standards,
        and they must subscribe to the ResellerRatings Merchant Member program to actively
        participate in resolving customer issues at ResellerRatings.
    



Minimum Ratings Requirements 

The ResellerRatings seal must pass a series of requirements based upon review acquisition recency, volume and maintained ratings.  From time to time
        these requirements are slightly modulated as to ensure it makes sense with our changing algorithms.  We always try to ensure stability of seals, and make sure massive input of negative or positive customer reviews
        from deals, fulfillment issues, etc, does not create a series of highs and lows.  The Elite Seal represents a high caliber merchant.
    .

    
 Merchant must be a merchant member 
 They must have at least 30 reviews in the last 6 months 
 Their average rating across ALL the reviews used to calculate their rating must be 8.0




 Your merchant store front is adorned with the logo for all the incoming direct traffic and from Shopping Channels to see! 



 You can place the Elite Seal on your own store front which pops up information about your store, thus not interrupting with the shopper funnel. 







 Click on the Seal above 



ResellerRatings Elite is not a guarantee or  a warranty that you will receive excellent service, but companies that qualify for ResellerRatings Elite have the highest customer satisfaction ratings of any companies listed on our site.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/23/1990
            

                BBB has determined that Everflow Eastern Partners LP meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

							Review:  Immediately after purchasing my next door property, I called Everflow Eastern Partners, L.P. to transfer mineral rights / royalty rights to my name. This occurred last November 2012. I received my mineral rights / royalty check but not a check for the neighboring property. In the past these checks arrived at my house and to my neighbor at the same time. The last check was sent to the wrong person and was never corrected top me. I was told this would not happen again.Desired Settlement:  Proper mineral right / royalty check sent to me ASAP.

                        Response:
                    Everflow Eastern Partners, L.P. appreciates the opportunity to respond to this landowner’s complaint, as it is extremely important to us that our landowners are treated fairly and in accordance with all agreements that we may have with them.  With regards to this particular complaint, we believe the transaction was handled properly and in accordance with our agreement with the landowner.    Ownership transfer of the royalty interests associated with the adjacent property purchased was made with a proper cutoff of oil and gas royalties paid between the former and current property owner.  Per our agreement with the current landowner, all royalties associated with both properties have been combined and checks have been mailed to the correct party at the correct address.  Before filing this response, we reached out to the landowner directly to ensure the situation had been adequately explained and to ensure that there were no further misunderstandings.  As part of the discussion, the landowner has requested that our agreement be changed to produce a separate check for each royalty interest owned by the two properties, which we will be happy to accommodate going forward.

							Review:  I received a royalty check from this company, dated November 20, 2013. I have a contract with them, leasing my property mineral rights since the early 90's. At first I received a small royalty check, yearly, but I have not received one for a least 2 years and now I receive this check for $***** and I cannot make heads or tails of what time period it involves or when the income was generated. There is an asterisk at the bottom of the page stating to see Distribution statement for more detail and there is no instructions of how to get such a statement. I went online and googled to try to obtain such and to no avail. I believe this is not good business practice and I would like some information from this company. Also they have a 60 day time limit on the check and then they deduct $***** to reissue it. I have over the years, almost yearly in the past five years, received a mailing from them to sell my rights, which I have not done, but there hasn't been a royalty check in about 3 years. I want some answers to these questionable practices and my entitlement of income from them having my home owner's mineral rights.Desired Settlement:  I would first of all like the information to assess for myself by seeing this distribution statement, where these royalties arise and also why I did not receive them for 2+ years without notification.

                    Everflow Eastern Partners, L.P. appreciates the opportunity to respond to this landowner’s complaint, as it is extremely important to us that our landowners are treated fairly and in accordance with all agreements that we may have with them.  With regards to this particular complaint, we believe the transaction was handled properly as the landowner has received prompt payments for all royalties earned to date in accordance with both our lease agreement with the landowner and company policy.  The distribution statement that the landowner refers to in the complaint is readily available to her (and all landowners) and was provided to her immediately upon her request after the company followed-up with a phone call after receiving her complaint through the Better Business Bureau.  The Company’s contact information is provided on the actual check and is also easily accessible online, as a simple Google search of “Everflow Eastern Partners” provides all contact information as the first search result.  Before filing this response, we reached out to the landowner directly to ensure the situation had been adequately explained and to ensure that there were no further misunderstandings.  As part of this conversation the landowner requested additional information, such as a copy of her executed lease and check history, which we were happy to provide.  We hope that this response clarifies any of the landowner’s questions, and if not we would be happy to discuss any further questions she may have at her convenience.

                    Everflow Eastern Partners, L.P. appreciates the opportunity to respond to this landowner’s complaint, as it is extremely important to us that our landowners are treated fairly and in accordance with all agreements that we may have with them.  With regards to this particular complaint, we believe the transaction was handled properly and in accordance with our agreement with the landowner.    Ownership transfer of the royalty interests associated with the adjacent property purchased was made with a proper cutoff of oil and gas royalties paid between the former and current property owner.  Per our agreement with the current landowner, all royalties associated with both properties have been combined and checks have been mailed to the correct party at the correct address.  Before filing this response, we reached out to the landowner directly to ensure the situation had been adequately explained and to ensure that there were no further misunderstandings.  As part of the discussion, the landowner has requested that our agreement be changed to produce a separate check for each royalty interest owned by the two properties, which we will be happy to accommodate going forward.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned
