“It’s been a wonderful experience working with HVPG. I’ve been given the opportunity to learn so much about affordable housing as well as to take charge in certain projects. The environment is great; everyone really listens to and supports you in your professional development.”Becky Nguyen, Baruch College


“I had a great time interning with Hudson Valley, and it was probably the most rewarding professional experience that I’ve had. Each day brought different challenges and I had the opportunity to make decisions on my own and learn from both my successes and failures. I will always reflect positively on my time at Hudson Valley, and feel that it has made me a more confident young professional.”Klaas Roberts, Columbia Unviersity

HVPG acquires HUD assisted, tax credit, and affordable market rate properties throughout the country. Using conventional financing and/or Low Income Housing Tax Credits, we have the capabilities to acquire large multi-state portfolios as well as individual assets as small as 50 units.
HVPG has strong relationships with a wide variety of investors, including family investment offices, high net worth individuals, social impact investors, and institutional investors.
HVPG has established regional partnerships with highly experienced construction, management, and development firms in order to extend its reach.
In 2014, HVPG will help preserve over 600 units of affordable housing using both tax credit and conventional equity, with a total development cost exceeding $80M
HVPG’s partnerships leverage over a $1B of transaction experience, including the preservation and development of more than 25,000 units.
Expertise
The HVPG team has the experience to navigate through many of the unique challenges of acquiring affordable properties, including:

Mark-to-Market Restructuring

When project-based rents are marked down the resulting debt structure is highly complex and often scares off many buyers or leads to failed deals.  HVPG, however, has the expertise to successfully execute an acquisition of this type.

HUD 236 Property Rehabilitation

Many HUD 236s are in need of repair but lack the cash flow to support it. A sale to HVPG could maximize value to owners while ensuring for the preservation of the units.

Partnership Issues & Conflicts

The ownership structures of affordable properties are complex and often involve a large number of limited partners. When partners develop divergent financial goals, HVPG is able to alleviate such conflict through the purchase of partial interests, whether it be the General Partnership or the Limited Partnership interests..

Tax Efficiency

Oftentimes owners may wish to sell their interests but are reluctant for fear of tax repercussions, especially recapture or phantom income. HVPG works closely with top tax advisors and can tailor the acquisition structure to best address an owner’s personal tax situation.
Flexibility
We are flexible in how we work with owners and can tailor our role to fit the situation and optimize the results. We understand the complexities of acquiring, refinancing and rehabilitating properties under State and/or Federal programs, including: Section 236 properties; Section 42 LIHTC properties; Section 8 properties; HUD 202 projects, or other federal or state assisted properties, including HOME. Thus, we position ourselves into the role most suitable for the project, as investors, co-developers, or advisors.
Our expertise in financing and our partnerships, both for-profit and not-for-profit, enable us to streamline the acquisition process from existing owners who may wish to exit the affordable housing arena, for any number of reasons. We offer owners the flexibility to remain in the project, guiding them through the complicated acquisition process, by incorporating them into Owner in Place Preservation (OPP). We work with expert contractor partners for rehabilitation of the units to help assure proper Agency & Investor compliance and viability of these projects for years to come.

We offer owners the flexibility to remain in the project, guiding them through the complicated redevelopment process, by incorporating them into Owner in Place Preservation (OPP). We work with expert contractor partners for rehabilitation of the units to help assure proper Agency & Investor compliance and viability of these projects for years to come.

FAQ’S
How would the redevelopment be financed?
HVPG (we) would help your organization refinance through either a FHA/HUD refinance or a 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credit/Tax Exempt Bond transaction. We would work with local and state agencies to maximize the financial support for the project, typically in the form of subsidies and grants.
How would the redevelopment benefit your organization?
This would benefit your organization in several ways. You would get a newly renovated property at no out-of-pocket expense to your organization. You would also have the opportunity for an upfront cash payment as well as increased long-term cash flows from operational efficiencies.
How is HVPG different? How is HVPG unique?Aside from having the prerequisite expertise and experience, we set ourselves apart in our flexibility. We are comfortable playing different roles, depending upon your organization’s interest and needs. We can simply act as a Fee Developer guiding your organization through the complicated process. We can also act as a development partner, providing financial guarantees and covering all out of pocket expenses with the project.
How would the transaction be structured?We would be happy to walk you and your organization through the details of how the transaction would be structured. In short, your organization will be able to maintain a long-term ownership position and can keep control of the operations if it desires.
What role would HVPG play? What role would the organization play?This is entirely negotiable. You let us know what you want us to do. We would usually provide financial guarantees, obtain financing, oversee the construction, and assist in all aspects of permanent loan conversion. Our long-term involvement depends on the final deal structure and the guarantees provided. We would expect you to provide us with all pertinent information about the property. We would also expect to work closely with you in determining together what improvements should be made to the property and what services can be enhanced/offered.
How would HVPG be compensated? How would the organization be compensated?Our compensation depends entirely on the role that we would play. The more financial risk we take on, the more
we would look to share in the economics of the transaction. We are flexible in what roles and responsibilities we would
take.
If the organization would like to retain ownership, we would provide development expertise, pre-development
funding and construction-completion guarantees on a fee-for-service basis. In this case, we would act as a Fee
Developer and not join in the ownership of the property. We would only receive payment out of developer fees
which are paid by the rehabilitation budget – NOT by the organization.
In a co-development scenario where we assume all or a portion of the construction-period financial guarantees, the
organization could potentially receive the up-front payment, a portion of the developer fee and cash flow. 
Is there a need to restructure the ownership of the building? If so, how does the organization maintain control of operations?It depends on how we finance the rehab. If we use tax credits, then we’d have to restructure ownership during the tax credit compliance period. The organization would maintain ownership (along with tax credit investors) during this time and have opportunity to control operations. After compliance, the tax credit investors exit and the organization retains ownership. If we did an FHA/HUD refinancing, then the current ownership of the building will not change.
If there is a need to restructure to bring in investors, exactly how would this need be accommodated? What percent of ownership would we be able to maintain?This is relevant if we pursue refinancing utilizing tax credits and tax-exempt bonds. This is something with which we have extensive experience and expertise. We would oversee the entire process including working with the investors. The question about ownership is a complicated one. During the tax credit compliance period the tax credit investors technically are involved in ownership. They exit after compliance. The long-term ownership of the property is not impacted by this financing structure. To the extent that you want us to help with long-term financial guarantees, we can. We would look for a fair compensation for that risk (usually in the form of a split of ownership), which is entirely negotiable.
In most instances, such a refinancing can provide the organization with additional capital to support its mission. Is this from the reduced interest expense, reductions in other operating expense?The organization can benefit in different ways, including but not limited to a potential upfront payment, management fees, and increased long-term cash flows from operational efficiencies.
Would the potential up-front cash payment be paid to the HDFC or to the sponsor, the organization?If the HDFC acts as fee owner only, the potential cash payment would be paid to the sponsor. This can be structured to achieve your goals.

HUD, NJHMFA and Hudson Valley Property Group Celebrate Completion of 207-unit Colt Arms Apartments RenovationPaterson, NJ, June 20, 2017 – Hudson Valley Property Group (HVPG) is pleased to announce the completion of the $11 million renovation project at Colt Arms Apartments, located in the 1st ward of Paterson, New Jersey. Dean Santa, Division Director of US Housing and Urban Development joined the development team at the ribbon cutting ceremony this past Tuesday, June 20, 2017 at 11am.
“Colt Arms Apartments is another great example of how HUD’s Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program can leverage public and private funding to preserve much needed housing that is now affordable for senior residents,” said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development New Jersey Field Office Director Maria Maio-Messano.  “HUD is also providing 20 years of rental subsidy that will keep these units affordable. Colts Arms seniors can now enjoy a beautifully renovated building with multiple amenities that will afford them a better quality of life and financial stability in their golden years.”
The property is located at 52 Godwin Street in Paterson, and was acquired in January 2016 by Hudson Valley Property Group, a New York City-based developer that is dedicated to the preservation of quality, well-managed affordable housing throughout the tristate area. Colt Arms is one of the early preservation projects in the nation utilizing the Rental Assistance Demonstration II (RAD II) program, which included the issuance of a new 20-year, Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) contract. The “project-basing” of the apartments not only ensures that Colt Arms will remain quality, affordable housing for decades to come, but it also made additional rental assistance available to residents that did not previously receive subsidy.
“The majority of residents were not subsidized. As a result of the RAD program, effectively all of the residents who are income-qualified received project-based assistance, which lowered the amount of money that the tenants

HUD’s Rental Assistance Demonstration Program Key to Preserving Long-Term Affordability
 
Bronx, New York – May 12, 2017 – Hudson Valley Property Group (HVPG), Phoenix Realty Group (PRG), ), and Belveron Partners are pleased to announce the completion of the $14 million renovation project for Keith Plaza and Kelly Towers, located in the Bronx, New York. Councilman of the 15th District, Ritchie Torres, HDC Chief Operating Officer & General Counsel, Richard Froehlich, Assistant Commissioner, Division of Housing Supervision, Julie Walpert, and HUD Deputy Regional Administrator of New York and New Jersey, Mirza Orriols,  joined the development team at the ribbon cutting ceremony this past Friday, May 12, 2017 at 11am.
“The extensive rehabilitation and preservation of more than 600 units of housing at Keith Plaza and Kelly Towers demonstrates the successful public and private partnership needed to protect the affordability and quality of our critical Mitchell-Lama housing stock,” said HDC President, Eric Enderlin.  “I would like to acknowledge and thank our many partners at HUD, HPD, Hudson Valley, Phoenix Realty Group, and Belveron Partners for all their hard work to preserve this vital affordable housing for The Bronx and New York City.”
“Our preservation work is safeguarding the affordability of homes and neighborhoods, and ensuring the quality of our city’s critical infrastructure – housing – for generations to come,” said HPD Commissioner Maria Torres-Springer.  “Preserving the remaining stock of Mitchell-Lama housing is an important component of the housing plan, and this investment is paying off at developments like Keith Plaza and Kelly Towers.  HPD thanks HDC, Hudson Valley Property Group, and Phoenix Realty Group for bringing much-needed improvements and the security of extended affordability to more than 600 families.”

Wall Street Journal: Affordable Housing Heats up in New JerseyMarch 19, 2017
By Keiko Morris
A joint venture of landlords and investors obtained a $144 million loan from Fannie Mae to finance its purchase of more than 1,000 affordable apartments mostly for seniors across several buildings in central and northern New Jersey, according to the company that structured the loan deal.
Walker & Dunlop arranged the financing for the $181 million acquisition by a joint venture of Hudson Valley Property Group LLC, Red Stone Companies LLC and Wheelock Street Capital, said Andrew Gnazzo, managing director of Walker & Dunlop.
The venture bought the seven buildings, which receive Section 8 housing assistance from the federal government, from Kline Enterprises.
The buying group acquired the portfolio intending to invest in the properties and upgrade the buildings, which are located in Paterson, Orange, East Orange, Metuchen, Old Bridge, Hazlet and East Windsor, Mr. Gnazzo said. The loan deal was a complex transaction that took about a year to close.
The affordable housing market is generally less competitive than the market-rate rental apartment sector but has begun to attract more investors. The multifamily rental industry has been one of the most desirable asset classes in the real-estate world for the last decade, Mr. Gnazzo said. Market-rate assets have become expensive and yields have shriveled, Mr. Gnazzo said.
Some investors looking for better returns have turned to the affordable housing market, joining forces with more experienced partners.
“This affordable housing space also has gotten competitive,” Mr. Gnazzo said. “You are getting a better bang for your buck.”

UVA TODAY: THE U.S. NEEDS MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS ALUMNUS IS LEADING THE WAYMarch 17, 2017
By Caroline Newman
This year, University of Virginia alumnus Jason Bordainick’s company, Hudson Valley Property Group, has rescued more than 2,500 affordable housing units from the chopping block and made them more livable and sustainable than ever, while still remaining affordable to the current tenants.
Affordable housing is a growing problem in the United States. One recent report from U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, found that a dramatic increase in renters, a 13 percent decline in existing affordable housing units and stagnant wage growth have caused the demand for affordable housing to outstrip supply.
Bordainick, who graduated from UVA’s McIntire School of Commerce in 2002, hopes that his company can provide a for-profit solution to that problem. He co-founded the company in 2010 with his childhood friend, Andrew Cavaluzzi. Their first project turned around nine affordable housing units in Newburgh, New York, about an hour from their hometown, and gave the pair a taste of what it was like to tangibly improve someone’s living situation.
“It turned out to be a good investment, and we got to directly see how our work changed the lives of the people living there,” said Bordainick, who in 2016 was named one of six top young leaders in the industry by Affordable Housing Finance. “We realized that we could replicate that success and grow a firm dedicated to the preservation of affordable housing.”
This is not Bordainick’s first venture into real estate. As an undergraduate, he started a student housing website that has now expanded to serve more than 2 million students at 100 universities, including UVA.
“I actually started my career as an entrepreneur at UVA,” Bordainick said. “I was recruited as a track athlete, but had an injury that curtailed my track career. So I put the time I had

Hudson Valley Property Group, Red Stone and Wheelock Street Capital acquire and preserve 1,009 units of New Jersey affordable housingNew Jersey, February 16, 2017 – Hudson Valley Property Group LLC (“HVPG”) and Red Stone Companies, LLC, in joint venture with Wheelock Street Capital, acquired 1,009 units of New Jersey senior and family affordable housing located throughout northern New Jersey. The seven properties are subsidized through US Department of Housing and Urban Development project-based Section 8 contracts. The acquisition is the first phase of a long-term preservation plan that will include thoughtful and sustainable upgrades to the properties in the years to come. HVPG is a New York City based affordable housing preservation firm. Red Stone was responsible for securing the debt financing and worked closely with HVPG to assemble the capital stack for the transaction. Wheelock Street Capital provided the majority of the equity capital. The debt was funded by utilizing a unique financing facility structured by Walker & Dunlop and Fannie Mae. The New Jersey-based property management company, Community Realty Management, assumed operations while retaining a majority of the existing management staff at each of the sites.
This transaction, which was valued at over $180 million, demonstrates a creative financing execution to preserve New Jersey’s aging supply of affordable housing without relying on limited state public funds. The properties are located in the towns of Hazlet, East Orange, Metuchen, Old Bridge, Orange, Windsor and Paterson. It is estimated that portfolio houses a total of 2,500 residents. The municipalities where these properties reside have been supportive of the preservation of the portfolio. The joint venture plans to hold the properties long-term and pursue renovations and sustainable upgrades based on the physical needs at each of the sites.
“The previous owners built an impressive organization and team providing much needed affordable housing throughout New Jersey. We are excited to have the opportunity to carry on their legacy, and to preserve

Paterson’s Colt Arms housing complex celebrates $12 million renovation and holidays with luncheon and Councilman Jackson
Dec. 19, 2016 – The new owner of the Colt Arms Apartments and senior citizens living at the Godwin Street housing complex celebrated the recently finished $12 million renovation of the building and the upcoming holidays with a luncheon.
Colt Arms, home to over 220 residents and staff, underwent an almost year-long construction project to fully renovate the building and individual units. New York City-based Hudson Valley Property Group spent $30 million to turnaround the 41-year-old senior housing complex it acquired for $9.6 million in January.
The developer spent approximately $12 million on rehabilitating the 14-story building. Works included replacement and upgrade of the heating system, improvements to the kitchens, bathrooms including new flooring, improved energy efficiency through upgrades to lighting, appliances, installation of solar panels, and water saving fixtures.
There was also painting, new flooring for hallways and renovation of all common areas. Outside of the building new roof, brick masonry replacement and repointing, addition of vertical and horizontal expansion joints, improvements to parking lot, walkways, and tenant recreation spaces works were completed.
Developer is also upgrading the fire alarm with new sprinkler system and setting up a new security system with surveillance cameras.
“I’m happy and pleased to be part of the Colt Arms Apartments community celebration and pleased to see progress with the transformation at this property,” councilman Michael Jackson said.
Jackson joined the residents, new owner, and property management company Pleasantville-based Community Realty Management on Thursday for the luncheon. All 220 residents and staff of the building at 52 Godwin Street were invited for the lunch event catered by Laneve’s Banquets at the complex’s newly renovated community room where they were provided a full holiday spread.
The developer is preserving low-income housing for seniors at the site for the next 20 years due to the Rental Assistant Demonstration (RAD) conversion executed at

Fresh Look, New Name for Long Island Community
by Veronica Grecu
Developers, capital sources and public agencies teamed up for a $11.7 million upgrade of a property in North Amityville, N.Y.

Babylon, N.Y.—An affordable housing community in the town of Babylon in Long Island, N.Y., went through an extensive rehabilitation process that aims extend the affordability of the development for another 20 years.
The newly renamed Plaza at Amityville, formerly known as Andpress Plaza, is located in the North Amityville area of Babylon and was built in 1983 with federal housing financing.

The 6-year old Hudson Valley Property Group (HVPG) is becoming a force in affordable housing.

“The Rent is Too Damn High” 
Last week the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University released their report on Rental Housing in the United States, America’s Rental Housing – Evolving Markets and Needs. The study found, along with many other key facts, that “more than half of renters – 21.1 million households – were cost burdened in 2012, paying more than 30 percent of income for housing. This is the greatest number of housing cost burdened renters on record,” proving, once again, that Jimmy McMillan has a point: “The Rent is Too Damn High.”
