Imperva Shifts Executive Technical Bench with Creation of Chief 
      Scientist Position




Terry Ray named chief technology officer; Amichai Shulman appointed 
      chief scientist






July 11, 2017 04:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time



REDWOOD SHORES, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Imperva, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: IMPV), committed to protecting business-critical data 
      and applications in the cloud and on-premises, today announced that its 
      chief product strategist, Terry Ray, was named chief technology officer 
      (CTO). In his new role, Ray will develop and articulate the company’s 
      technical vision and strategy. Imperva also announced that its 
      co-founder and former CTO, Amichai Shulman was elevated to Chief 
      Scientist to align with his research background.
    


      “It is with great pleasure that I announce Terry’s promotion to CTO. His 
      deep commitment to Imperva and his dedication to our customers and 
      partners makes him ideally suited for the role,” said Anthony 
      Bettencourt, CEO of Imperva. “Terry was the first U.S.-based Imperva 
      employee, and his technical background along with insights from 
      customers helped establish our early product roadmap. He possesses a 
      unique perspective on global and regional security and audit 
      requirements and strategic capabilities that will help him to lead, and 
      further grow Imperva."
    

      Reporting to Imperva CEO Anthony Bettencourt, Ray will have global 
      responsibility for the company's technology strategy. During his 14 
      years at Imperva, Ray has focused his efforts on data security and risk, 
      working with hundreds of companies across an array of industries to help 
      them discover and protect sensitive data, create controls to minimize 
      risk for regulatory governance, set data security strategy and implement 
      best practices. A graduate of the University of North Texas with a B.S. 
      degree in Management Information Systems, Ray previously held the 
      position of chief product strategist at Imperva and before that held a 
      variety of senior sales engineering positions at the company.
    

      “I am thrilled to help Imperva take cyber security to the next level, as 
      we continue to bring innovative solutions to market that enable 
      enterprises to protect their critical data and applications,” said Ray. 
      “The dynamics of the cyber security and data security landscape are 
      energizing, and this new position provides me an opportunity to lend my 
      unique perspective, built on years of experience and interactions with 
      customers in more than 40 countries, to the role,” said Ray, CTO for 
      Imperva.
    

      Shulman was part of the trio that founded Imperva in 2002 and 
      subsequently headed the company’s research arm, which focuses on 
      security analysis, vulnerability discovery, DDoS mitigation and 
      compliance expertise. In his new role, Shulman will be instrumental in 
      monitoring emerging technologies and companies especially as they relate 
      to machine learning and data and application security.
    

      “Imperva wouldn’t exist without Amichai’s many contributions and 
      inventions,” said Bettencourt. “His vision and ability to identify major 
      trends have propelled Imperva into a cyber security leader and have kept 
      us at the forefront of technology. In this new role, he’ll continue to 
      pursue innovative solutions and will help us identify up and coming 
      technologies that advance our cyber security solutions.”
    

      Shulman, who started Imperva out of a relative’s garage, is a pioneer in 
      research and innovation in data and application cyber security and has 
      made significant contributions to Imperva and the industry. Previously, 
      he served in the Israel Defense Forces, where he led a team that 
      identified new computer attack and defense techniques. He has B.Sc and 
      Master’s Degrees in Computer Science from the Technion, Israel Institute 
      of Technology.

Unedited: Tales, Tips and Technologies from a Security Company CISO
Recorded: 

Nov 3 2016

48 mins


Shahar Ben-Hador, Chief Information Security Officer;  Paul Steen, Senior Director, Global Security Strategist
It’s Cyber Security Awareness Month—a great time to prepare your company against cyber threats.  We know that running security for your company can be a difficult task. In addition to dealing with employees and executives, CISOs have the added challenge of working with the board. We want to share what we’ve learned, and talk about what has and has not worked for us. Spoiler alert: “You can’t patch people.”

Join this webinar with Shahar Ben-Hador, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and Paul Steen, Senior Director, Global Security Strategist for a lively interactive session that will include:
·         Humorous security tales and repercussions of employee behaviors
·         Tips to deal with employees, execs and board members
·         Security technology recommendations that work best across a security stack

Cybersecurity is ultimately about people, and, for better or worse, human nature will always prevail. The trick is establishing a pragmatic security posture to deal with that reality. Join our CISO for an off-script, unedited security discussion.

Do you have pressing questions you’d like to have answered? Send them to AskTheCISO@imperva.com, and we’ll get them in front of our CISO. Who knows? They might just end up part of the discussion.
