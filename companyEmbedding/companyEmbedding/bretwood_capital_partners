Bretwood Capital Partners, LLC (BCP) is an independent, minority and employee-owned, registered investment management firm specializing in value oriented equity management and customized portfolios. BCP was founded in 2004 and currently has three strategies: Domestic Long/Short (Bretwood Voyager Fund I L.P.), Bretwood Municipal Credit Opportunities Fund L.P., and the Tactical Asset Allocation Strategy. The firm seeks to manage assets for Public and Private Institutions, Corporations, Foundations, Endowments and High Net-Worth Individuals. Our management team has an average of 15 years of industry experience, headquartered in Atlanta Georgia.
When selecting our company name, we searched for a name that defined what we stand for as an investment firm. The street name of Bretwood Drive brought back memories, where life was simple yet committed to bringing out the best in all mankind. As a youth, our Founder viewed it as a safe, secure and nurturing environment where one’s potential was limited only to his abilities. At Bretwood Capital Partners our objective is to implement “a high-quality and well-constructed portfolio to protect and grow your investments.”

Philosophybretwoodcap2015-09-04T18:32:30+00:00 
PhilosophyWe are value focused and performance driven.
We believe our “Quantamental” approach intelligently integrates quantitative and fundamental analysis that consistently identifies attractive portfolio candidates. Our philosophy is that one must invest for the long term thus we buy companies to own and not to trade. We believe that the six drivers of performance are:

Valuation
Market Sentiment
Operating Trends
Earnings Estimate Trends
Leverage
Shareholder Value Creation

Adhering to a strict investment discipline, we believe our portfolio construction process optimizes the tradeoff between expected return and risk for our investors. As an investment manager, our added value comes from owning the best companies that provide superior long term performance.
Finally, in every market cycle, there is a period where high quality companies take on the role of “a defensive barrier” of strength to protect against strong downside volatility. We attempt to make money for our clients by providing this fortification against the late market cycle downside movement. Our focus is on achieving long term equity growth with an emphasis on capital preservation.

ClientsInstitutional Investors:
Large, mid-size and small institutions have unique needs that require a specialized approach to asset management. Bretwood Capital Partners acts as an investment advisor to public pension and retirement plans; and we have a successful track record of providing services to them. These institutions leverage our expertise in strategy design and tactical asset allocation. Guided by a total return concept, our investment strategy manages risk and captures opportunities in a liquid and transparent manner.
Foundations and Endowments:
Due to the indefinite investment time horizon, opposing interests of current beneficiaries verses future beneficiaries, and the involvement of numerous stakeholders, non-profit organizations face challenging and unique issues. Bretwood Capital Partners has a successful history of managing the investment needs of foundations and endowments. Our investment strategies are designed to create wealth over complete market cycles while preserving capital. With portfolio risks managed through asset allocation and investment strategy diversification, our foundation and endowment client portfolios are carefully constructed to perform effectively under a variety of market conditions.

Bretwood Capital Partners, LLC (BCP) is an independent, minority and employee-owned, registered investment management firm specializing in value oriented equity management and customized portfolios. BCP was founded in 2004 and currently has three strategies: Domestic Long/Short (Bretwood Voyager Fund I L.P.), Bretwood Municipal Credit Opportunities Fund L.P., and the Tactical Asset Allocation Strategy. The firm seeks to manage assets for Public and Private Institutions, Corporations, Foundations, Endowments and High Net-Worth Individuals. Our management team has an average of 15 years of industry experience, headquartered in Atlanta Georgia.
When selecting our company name, we searched for a name that defined what we stand for as an investment firm. The street name of Bretwood Drive brought back memories, where life was simple yet committed to bringing out the best in all mankind. As a youth, our Founder viewed it as a safe, secure and nurturing environment where one’s potential was limited only to his abilities. At Bretwood Capital Partners our objective is to implement “a high-quality and well-constructed portfolio to protect and grow your investments.”
