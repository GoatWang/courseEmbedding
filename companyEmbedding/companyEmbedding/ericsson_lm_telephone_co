            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Peter Nyquist will now open up the call.
Peter Nyquist
Thank you and welcome all to this second call for today. With me here today, I have our CEO, Börje Ekholm and our CFO, Carl Mellander.
So during the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual results may differ materially due to factors mentioned in today's press release and discussed in this conference call. We encourage you to read about these risks and uncertainties in our earnings report as well as in our annual report.
With that said, I would like to start off this call by inviting Börje Ekholm to begin. Please Börje.
Börje Ekholm
Thank you Peter. Welcome everyone and thank you all for joining. So let me start with of the starting point. We see our company performance to be unsatisfactory, clearly highlighting the need for the new focus strategy we laid out a few weeks ago. The quarter was very challenging overall and very tough but it's also a mixed picture. We see networks delivering a solid result despite declining sales but we also see accelerated losses in our IT, cloud and media businesses and here we need to take additional actions.
The strategy we launched, a more focused strategy with the objective to regain technology and market leadership resulting in an improved profitability. We see here that we basically need to focus our portfolio on areas where we can and must win. We will also intensify the focus on our cost structure in order to make us more efficient and lean. This will include simplifying the way we work internally as well as making portfolio choices. We also see that we need to selectively increase our investments in some of the core areas to make sure we have the competitive products we need to win in the market, again a few years out. And we expect our strategy and we still behind that. We should see significant improvements already during next year, but we also have this ambition to double our operating, call it underlying operating margin, beyond 2018.
Looking at the first quarter, we see sales down about 16%, if we adjust for foreign exchange. We also have significant adjustments that we will go through in more detail of SEK13.4 billion during the quarter in line with the announcement we made in the end of March. It includes restructuring charges, asset write-downs as a consequence of the new strategy as well as provisions and adjustments relating to certain customer projects. Our cash flow was worse or slightly better than last year, but still negative SEK1.5 billion. And we also see that our cost and efficiency program is not yielding the necessary result, given the profitability outlook as well as our market outlook.
If we look in the different segments, we see networks falling by 18%. It's due to lower mobile broadband investments, but it's also due to the reduced scope in the managed services contract in North America and lower IPR revenues. We also had a falling, as you all know, into Q4 of last year of some hardware deliveries, which also impacted Q1 sales volume. The operating margin was, however, 12% or we made little more than SEK4 billion in this area despite lower IPR revenues. We think that is a very solid performance. We also see that historically we have lost market share for the last several years and we have seen that kind of stabilize during the last few quarters, which is due to our Ericsson Radio System platform which clearly is a competitive platform in the market.

IT and cloud is down 7%. That's really our services side there growing but what we see here is lower legacy product sales and we do not see our new products being able to offset that decline. So the decline in legacy products are happening quicker than we anticipated and have seen before. Our operating margin also here fell due to lower sales, of course, but also a falling service margin. Here, our performance is not satisfactory. We need to do a number of actions that we are undertaking those already as a consequence of the strategic announcement. It's really to accelerate product introductions to get our new product to catch on faster, streamline the service organization as well as tightening scope on contracts as much as we can. And we expect to see improvements here during 2018.
For our media business, we also see here sales down more than 20%, partly explained by lower IPR revenues, but the big part here is actually the legacy product portfolio also falling faster than we have been able to grow our new products. And that has resulted in, as you can see, a big loss of over SEK1 billion, which is due to lower gross margin in sales. And this unit, we are basically looking at this from two product parts. One is the product and one is our broadcast services and we are exploring strategic opportunities for this business.
With that, I am going to give the word over to Carl Mellander, our CFO.
Carl Mellander
Thank you Börje. So very important to consider when looking at this first quarter report, this difference between the underlying business which we just talked about here now and the one-off items, the extraordinary items and here I would like to go through a little bit more what those extraordinary items are. And as you see here, they fall into three categories.
First of all, restructuring charges, of course, of SEK1.7 billion. This is business as usual. And you know we have indicated a total of between SEK6 billion and SEK8 billion for the full year, which also is in line with the amount we had in restructuring during 2016.
The second category is write-downs. This is as a direct consequence of some of the strategic decisions that we have made and which we communicated at end of March. So here we are talking about some specific assets capitalized development and intangible assets that we have taken an impairment on following those strategic decisions around focused portfolio.
The third category is around provisions and adjustments and for customer contracts and this can be broken down into several different components as well. First of all, we have, as you can see, a hit from net sales by SEK1.4 billion and this relates then to certain settlements with customers, but also revaluation of discounts in certain customer contracts where volume has decreased. And secondly, we have had to reassess the value of our trade receivables in connection with some customers on contracts and taken an impairment there or have set provision, I should say.
And then finally then, part of SEK8.4 billion also provisions in connection with some specific projects. And those projects are mainly in the IT and cloud space. We have discussed them before also saying that those are complex undertakings. And then here we have seen during first quarter some negative development which has made it necessary for us to make provisions for cost where we don't see that we will be able to recover those cost with future revenues. So all-in-all, as SEK13.4 billion in the quarter in extraordinary items. And as you can see then, the underlying business, excluding all of those items and that on the gross margin of 30.5% and an operating income of SEK1.1 billion.
Finally on this picture, we talk about tax impact and we are mainly talking about provisions here. So by definition it's an estimate of future impact, but we estimate the cash impact to be SEK5.8 billion and this will come over several years, depending on how specifics in those contract and projects develop.

We move on to look at the geographical sales split and here we have used the new split of the company in terms of geography, the market area structure. So as you can see here, South East Asia, Oceania and India grew slightly by 1% and that growth really comes from South East Asia where the growth continues in mobile broadband investments, while India is showing challenged market with consolidations coming up, but also challenging pricing situation on the market for operators at the moment.
North East Asia flat year-over-year. As you can see, Mainland China declined somewhat but we do see the growth now coming in Japan and Korea, offsetting China. In general, I would say China is a relatively stable market from what we see.
North America also stable as a market. We see downturn in our own sales year-over-year. And this is mainly to do with the managed service contract which we have talked about repeatedly the last couple of quarters as well.
Europe and Latin America, different story. Here sales is really down by 16% year-over-year. And of course, we do see slowdown in Latin America in general and not least in Mexico while Brazil is compensating somewhat for that. But overall, Latin America is down with the challenge macroeconomics.
When it comes to Europe, the level is continuously low when it comes to CapEx investment by operators and this is also reflected in our downturn.
Finally Middle East and Africa, challenged macroeconomics and this is the impacting us indirectly of course via the investment budgets of our customers.
If we move on to look at gross margin and the delta here, what explains it year-over-year is really first of all the IPR licensing revenue piece and Börje mentioned it already that and as many of you will remember, Q1 2016 we had couple of one-off items in IPR licensing revenues and that these were not repeated now. So with a total volume in IPR of SEK2 billion on the topline that fell short compared with last year's quarter one by SEK1.8 billion and this, of course, has an impact on gross margin.
Networks, fairly stable. If anything, a little bit positive while both IT and cloud and media then caused the gross margin overall to come down for the reasons explained here on the slide.
And we can move to the next one. Looking at the gross margin on a sequential basis instead and we see that we actually improved gross margin from fourth quarter and the part which is positive here to start with is in the network segment side as well where the share of capacity business as well as the share of IPR business increased. And frankly, the absolute the mounds are down but of course, when we look at gross margin percentage this has a positives impact because the share was higher.
IT and cloud, again reduced margins in those large transformation projects that we talk about and IT managed services as well while media in the comparison was flat sequentially.
Operating income then, if we look at this bridge, again comparing with Q1. Last year, IPR took its toll on the operating income as well, of course, with shrinking volume and the gross margin decline that I just described and we also had negative impact on the operating income.
Expenses, I will come back to in a second because that's contributed slightly then to the bottom line in this quarter.
Cost savings, as Börje already said in his the intro here, we are not satisfied with our cost structure and we need to do more. That's quite clear. We have the ongoing program, which is not yielding the sufficient results if we look at the current market situation as well as our position of the company. So here we will focus more, do more on structural actions. And of course now that we have stopped the specific timing on the SEK53 billion in OpEx, it's very important to note this does not mean that we put less effort on cost reductions, because this is of course key to our competitiveness going forward and we aim to surpass this ambition over time while of course the cost level can temporarily increase as we invest in certain of the areas to regain leadership.

Gross cash position then, you can see the operating cash flow in the breakdown there, of course also very impacted between net income and operating assets from the extraordinary items but it washes out on the total. And you can see restructuring cash out in the quarter was SEK1.6 billion.
Investing, capital investments are coming down on CapEx now as we are closing or completing the ICT Center buildout. And then you see that the effect of the EUR1 billion raised through two Euro bonds is coming into the cash flow here as well and that's a SEK10.9 billion net effect that you can see. But overall, net cash decreased by SEK2.9 billion in the quarter.
A few words on reporting then. We are going to change the external reporting latest Q1 2018 to reflect our internal organization. What we do now as a small first step is to rename the media segments to other. And we will also go from the 10 regions that we have reported on before to five market areas to reflect how we are now as going forward in Ericsson. We will of course provide you with the restated numbers as well in advance as well.
Finally then, these are the planning assumptions that we have included in the report, some of which are repetitions from earlier but we want to put them here so you know how we see the outlook. And first of all, we expect then that the trends that we see currently in the industry but also in the business mix, in our case in mobile broadband we will prevail during the year. We stick to our previous estimate of minus 2% to minus 6% decline in the RAN equipment market in dollar terms. We reiterate the fact that the rescoped managed services contract will have an impact on sales.
And then we have a new item which you will also find in the report and that's the fact that now with our strategy regarding managed services and NRO which includes certain streamlining and addressing low performing contract, we expect that the topline effect of that will be up to SEK10 billion by 2019. We repeat when it comes to the IPR business that the baseline on the contract portfolio as it stands is around SEK7 billion. And finally then that the restructuring charges for the year will be SEK6 billion to SEK8 billion, as I said before. This is what we see now based on the visibility we have today.
So with that, thanks a lot and back to you, Börje.
Börje Ekholm
Thanks Carl. So just to wrap up before we get into Q&A. What we see now is, as we said, we had a tough quarter, a challenging quarter. We put though our new strategy in place which includes much more focus on areas where we can and must win. We are also allocating more resources to increase the pace of innovation and new business development. Our new strategy or focus strategy, the purpose of that is of course to reestablish and revitalize our technology and market leadership but it should lead also to restoring profitability. And we are big believers in first we have to stability then we need profitability and from there on we can grow. So our near-term priority is to restore profitability. We are going to take significant actions internally and we are doing that with simplifying our organizational structure under a new leadership team and we expect to see significant improvements in profitability already in 2018 from the actions we take now and they should start to come through during next year. We also see with our focus strategy we are on the path towards doubling the 2016 operating margin when we are beyond 2018.
With that, I give the word over to Peter for any questions.
Peter Nyquist
Yes. Thank you Börje. So operator, we are now ready for the Q&A session. So please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Peter Nyquist
Hi Pierre.
Pierre Ferragu
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Börje, I would like to come to the areas for which you are considering strategic options. So I had in mind that media of course and [indiscernible] as well maybe IT and routing. And so when we look at the new reporting structure that you have given over recent months, it looks like these areas, after they are losing all of this money, like SEK8 billion to SEK10 billion, in what area I have estimated. And so my question was, what do you really mean by strategic options? What are the options you have at hand? Of course, I can imagine unit you find a buyer but I would assume like a risk, if you don't find a buyer for some of these activities is real, so if you don't find a buyer, are these activities that you would shut down as well? Would you consider that option? What I am trying to see is whether over time, we should consider these activities are not going to be part of Ericsson anymore?
Börje Ekholm
I understand you want to backstop in reality.
Pierre Ferragu
Exactly.
Börje Ekholm
What we have said and that's what we are doing, we are focusing our efforts on three parts in the company which is networks, managed services and digital services. That's where we are going to focus our investments in order to make sure that we win those areas. That includes investing in our current product portfolio for 4G and LTE, of course in networks. It includes investing in our solutions for digital services. And it includes investing in automation and basically getting the benefits from more use of technology in our managed services. That's our core focus.
Then we had said, we will explore strategic options for our IT cloud infrastructure hardware business, which is just a portion of what we do in there. Then we are looking at alternatives which basically have the purpose to make our solutions more attractive for our customers. At the end of the day, that's really what matters.
We have also said, we are pursuing strategic opportunities for the media business, which of course includes all different options, partnerships, divestitures, et cetera. But the reality here is, we are focusing on making sure we maximize the value at the same time. We think we have great products going into the market within the media business and we already see traction on those. But we think, in order to gain the critical scale to actually succeed in a very fragmented and evolving media marketplace, we need to look at different opportunities to do so. And that's what we are doing right now.
Pierre Ferragu
Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.
Peter Nyquist
Okay. Pierre, thanks. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Peter Nyquist
Hello Ed.
Edward Snyder
Thank you very much. A couple of questions. You said you expect, well you had some write-offs in the IT group, some strategic realignments there that increased your cost. I am just curious, is that realization that the products won't make traction in the market, you just thought that you are in a technical difficulties, you basically said you weren't going to be able to get the cost structure there? I am just trying to get a feeling for what happened in the IT structure that caused such a big write-off?
Börje Ekholm
You want to take it?
Carl Mellander
When it comes to the write-offs and the provisions, if you talk about that, then really related to some specific customers commitment and contract that we have where we have had negative development in those contracts. And therefore estimating then the future business plans of those contracts, we see that we do have excess cost compared with what we will be able to invoice the customer and get paid for. So this is really the issued. Very complex project and we have now, given these recent negative events, taken new view on that to estimate the cost overruns and hence the provisions.

Edward Snyder
All right. I am just trying to get to, was the change in terms of the contract by the customer or of the contract or was it just realizing you weren't going to be able to deliver on what the original trends were at the cost that you originally thought you could?
Carl Mellander
I think when it comes to scoping, we have learnt a lot during the journey here and some of those projects I think we can say could have been scoped in a better way. I think what we are trying to say is really that these are very complex projects in multiyear implementation phase and the multiyear, when they are up and running at the customer premises or customer solutions more than premises. So when we have done the scoping, to some extent we could have done it better. And that's what we are working on improving for the future. It's not that we are not capable of delivering the solutions. We just think it's going to get slightly more expensive than we expected before on a couple of these projects.
Edward Snyder
So it's not like less than a change in the market or a eroding market profile and more just learning curve on how do these projects and how to scope them better?
Carl Mellander
That's correct.
Peter Nyquist
Okay Ed?
Edward Snyder
Yes, sir.
Peter Nyquist
You good with that?
Carl Mellander
I think he has one more question.
Peter Nyquist
You have one more question.
Edward Snyder
Yes. One more real quick. We are reliving, to some extent, the microcosm we went through that we went through from the 2G to 3G transition way back when you had a scope of the industry was too large to support the demand profile and we went through that big wave of consolidation. It sounds to be similar here in that 5G or even 4G is not keeping up demand wise with the base of suppliers that have here. To what extent do you see, I know there are trials going on 5G, any in change or any hope in terms of pickup of demand for the new systems that would probably be some of the pressure on your sales force or your sales line? Or are we looking at a longer slog before we can wither see a pickup in revenue or a decline in competitive base of suppliers until we get to some sort of rationalization in the market?
Carl Mellander
Well, that's a few billion dollar question you are asking there. The reality is, the way I at least look at it is, the LTE technology will live for a very long period of time and you can look at the demand for data to the handsets or to the terminal, its growing still is a very high rate. That will, for a long period of time, be provided by the LTE generation. So it's really important that we continue to invest in technology for 4G. Then I think the 5G is starting to take some definition and some shape and we are starting to see field trials. Big commercial deployments are still going to be a few years out. But I do think that we should think differently about market where 4G really was a human communication channel, 5G will be increasingly utilizing machines. So it's going to be a different market when that comes. And I think that's what we should prepare ourselves for. So reality is, we still see a pretty good 4G market that will then later be complemented by 5G.
Edward Snyder
Thank you.
Peter Nyquist
Okay. Thank you Ed. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Gareth Jenkins from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Peter Nyquist
Hi Gareth.
Gareth Jenkins
Yes. Thanks guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones, if I could. One, I wondered if you could just talk about what's changed in the market since the start of the year, if anything, versus expectations? I think you touched on pricing in India and M&A there and also obviously Mexico and Brazil. But I wonder if you could just what widen that out in terms of whether you have seen any other changes since the start of the year? And then secondly, I just wondered what systems you are now putting in place? And I am talking about process and internal systems to Ericsson to avoid some of the visibility issues that we have seen in the past? Is it more around price warrants or what kind of internal systems and prices and checks and balances have you installed? Thank you.

Börje Ekholm
If you look at the market, you know I think Carl outlined what we see. We don't see a whole lot more than that. I mean it is a very competitive environment and it's a tough market. We have said already in our strategic forecast which has not changed that the market this year would fall to 6% in USD terms for equipment. We still think that's a reasonable estimate. And then after this year it will start to level out. So nothing has changed in that. So I think that's kind of what we see. We wouldn't say anything else. We are so geographically diverse, so we will always have some regions which are weaker or stronger than others. And of course it is challenging in parts of the world like Mexico and India, et cetera and those we are seeing as well. If we look at the way we run the pricing, it has a big element actually of price control in the way we run already. So that's not a big difference. Where we are changing, it's more on scoping of big transformation projects to implement and streamline our service delivery so we at least mitigate the risks in them as much as we can.
Did I miss any question? You talked about a system to avoid previous situation that we have right there, Gareth?
Gareth Jenkins
Yes. Thanks.
Börje Ekholm
And that's what I saying that this is about on the project scoping that we are trying to get the processes in line in order to make sure we mitigate the risks of scope issues. So it's all about learning and process within the company.
Gareth Jenkins
Could you elaborate on that? Is that regular meetings between services and products? Is it having software systems in place to work through?
Börje Ekholm
This is why we actually changed the organization where we have moved product and services together now. And it was really in IT and cloud area. So we have merged our product organization with service delivery in order to get the tighter process to manage the scope better.
Gareth Jenkins
Okay. Thank you.
Peter Nyquist
Thanks Gareth. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Peter Nyquist
Hi Tim.
Tim Long
Hi. How are you doing? A few part here just talking about getting the longer term margin outlook. Just give us a little color on how you think the gross margin and the OpEx split will look in getting to those numbers? And then just curious about the revenue backdrop also to get to that? It sounds like you are assuming some stabilization in 2018 and probably beyond. Could you talk a little bit about how you think the gap is filled before we get the real 5G build going? So what do you think it is following this year that will help the industry recover a little bit? Is it just pure capacity upgrades or maybe it is early 5G that would be helpful? Thank you.
Carl Mellander
Carl here. I maybe at least the first part when you talk about the margin development going forward. I mean what we do say now is that the actions we are taking now, following the focus strategy will give clearly improved profitability by 2017. Sorry, by 2018. I am sorry. And that we will double then profitability going forward. So of course it's around continues improvements in networks. We talked about some of the factors here earlier including Ericsson Radio System, but also services streamlining. Of course, when it comes to IT and cloud, many actions to improve also the situation there in terms of scoping on new contracts and managing the existing complex contracts that we have. And exact numbers of gross margin, we are not really talking about in the report. But so I think I leave it at that. That's a clear improvement by 2018 through to the actions we are taking. When it comes to cost then, we have, as we said, stopped the specific guidance on the SEK53 billion in OpEx. And yes, we are aiming for better numbers but temporarily then, as we said, we might also increase the R&D piece of that numbers in order to invest in some of the areas where we need to regain the leadership. So that's I think as much as I can say.

Peter Nyquist
Great. Thanks Carl. Are you happy with that, Tim?
Tim Long
Yes. Just curious on the revenue side. What do you think for the industry will help things stabilize?
Carl Mellander
I think we haven't changed really our strategic forecast from November where we said 2018 total equipment purchases in U.S. dollars would stabilize. Nothing has changed in that outlook.
Tim Long
Okay. Thank you.
Peter Nyquist
Thanks Tim. Next question, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Peter Nyquist
Hi Simon.
Simon Leopold
Thank you for taking my question. Morning or afternoon. I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit on IT and cloud? Maybe some more specifics would be helpful? And what I am really trying to get at is how to think about the revenue and profitability trends for the balance of this year? And maybe part of it is that I am a bit lost by the pro forma or the gross income being significantly negative, even on somewhat similar revenue year-over-year, although down slightly. So I think on a little bit loss on the GAAP but ultimately I am trying to get at better understanding of the trends. Thank you.
Carl Mellander
Again, the trend for the rest of the year we are not really guiding on. But we say that especially in the IT and by 2018, we will see effects of the actions that we are taking now. So I think that's really and we have described what the actions are that we are taking as well. So the impact will be visible in 2018.
Börje Ekholm
And I think the challenge here is also that we see that we need to and that's what we said on the cost side, we are going to see some increased investments also to make sure that we accelerate our new products and bringing them to the market faster and that we will also probably have some cost for changing the structure in there. And that's what we see right now and we haven't really guided any more specifically than that.
Simon Leopold
Well, I guess what I am worried about is that if we make assumptions that are based on our prior models and sort of ignore this March quarter and maintain assumptions is a risk of disappointing investors in future quarters. If we make adjustments that are too extreme then it sort of throws the credibility of what the estimates are. So if there is anything incremental you can give us in terms of how to think about it differently versus what we may have been thinking last quarter?
Börje Ekholm
Let me describe what in reality has happened, which is that this legacy product portfolio in IT and cloud has fallen faster than any time before. So call it an accelerated reduction in there and we have not been able to compensate that with our new product portfolio. And at the same time, you see an increasing volume of services, which is due to large IT transformation projects and they are growing as a portion of the business area. In addition, those services have had a compressed margin in Q1, more so than before. And I think that's really what has happened and we have said that we will not guide on the detail quarters going forward. But there you have really the cause behind the deviation in Q1.
Simon Leopold
Okay. Thank you very much.
Peter Nyquist
Thanks Simon. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Smith from Agency Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Douglas Smith
Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to revisit this issue of the customer provisions and is it in your analysis that this sales incentives were inappropriate and they rewarded winning short-term contract but not long-term projects? Or is it in your analysis more than engineering issue about being able to deliver what the salesmen promised?
Börje Ekholm

I think it's fair to say that we do have a number of very large IT transformation or digital transformation projects at our customers. And here this is a new market. So it's an element of, call it, not knowing exactly what demands you would put on a new system. So we label it as where we have to improve the scoping. So it's more our own ability to scope these projects well enough when they are in areas that are not we nor anybody else have done before. And that's really why this is, call it, a step-by-step learning experience where we have taken of course, here you can accuse us of having taken some projects with now we have to provide against. But they are really done because we are entering a new area where it takes some time to build the experience base internally to scope them well enough. Sales incentive or anything like that, is rather when you enter uncharted territories, by definition you don't know all the facts.
Douglas Smith
So do you imagine this is an industrywide problem, just inability to scope correctly?
Börje Ekholm
I don't know. But I can only judge from ourselves. I think we have taken the steps now to learn from our past experiences in order to make sure that we are better at it going forward.
Douglas Smith
Okay. Thanks. A quick clarification, would I be reading it right when you say strategically you are looking for Ericsson to be somewhat a smaller company, but a much more profitable company. Is that a good way to put it?
Börje Ekholm
What we have said is that we will manage ourselves out of unprofitable projects or contracts within managed services and NRO. We have also said that we are pursuing strategic opportunities for some parts of the company. So your assumption, I think could basically be confirmed with that, right.
Douglas Smith
Okay. Thank you.
Peter Nyquist
Thanks Douglas. Next question please operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Anthony from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Terrence Anthony
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just had two quick questions. Do you think you can hold on to your investment grade rating given the cash outflow for the provisions to increased costs from your added investments, the restructuring which isn't paying off and the cash generation remains weak and on top of that you have got the DoJ investigation overhang? And the second question is again in terms of your contracts, do you anticipate any further provisions as some of your other customer try to renegotiate them?
Börje Ekholm
You want it? Shall I take it? When it comes to investment grade rating, of course it's important for us and the Board has also stated that earlier that investment grade rating is something as being important. Of course, we can't really speculate what the rating agencies will do but we are in close contact with them, of course, to deal with it. So let's see. For us, it's important to remain investment grade.
When it comes to further provision, I would say, by definition what we have visibility on now is what we have taken action on in the quarter. So all the provisions we have done is based on our assessment of the current situation and this is all we have visibility on now. Of course, as in any project business, you don't know if this has inherent risks to it, of course this type of business. But we don't have any more visibility into that at the moment.
Terrence Anthony
Okay. Just one quick follow-up. Would you be willing to raise equity to defend investment grade rating?
Börje Ekholm
Now you are asking a very hypothetical question. I think the rating is of course important. We believe we have a plan in place that puts us in a solid financial position to deliver on that. That's really what we are focused on.
Terrence Anthony

Okay. Thank you.
Börje Ekholm
Thank you. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Johannes Schaller from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir. Your line is now open.
Johannes Schaller
Yes. Thanks gentlemen for taking my questions. Two, if I could. Firstly on IT and cloud, I think it's clear that you have a lot of strategic options here, but if we assume you would not find a buyer or a strategic partner for that business, but you would have to keep operating that business as it is right now, can you outline little bit more what your strategy would be in that case? I think it would be very helpful for us to understand the plan here a bit better. And then secondly, Börje, I think when you came out with the new strategic plan, you said the R&D budget would be more or less the same going forward, but it would be allocated in a different way. You seem to be indicating an increase in R&D now over the next quarter. So maybe you could help us understand a bit better what has changed over the last weeks in your thinking about this? Thank you.
`
Börje Ekholm
If we start with the first question, we have laid out a strategy four weeks ago and we are focus on implementing that. That includes pursuing some strategic options or alternative for parts of the business. We haven't really focused on, assume for a moment we do not achieve that, what we are focused on is executing on it instead. And so were not, let me not go into any hypothetical questions basically. So here we don't have any reason to not believe we can deliver on the strategy. If we look at what we see and this may have been poorly expressed a few weeks ago but the reality is we saw already at that time more of a shift in the costs. So I don't think we are we would materially need to increase R&D. But we saw that we may need to shift into R&D. But where we see that we need to invest more right now, it's actually in the introduction of new products and to drive acceleration of our new product portfolio in IT and cloud. And that's really where we see the need for more investments.
Johannes Schaller
Understood. So maybe just a clarification on your, first on to IT and cloud. So should we take from that, that you are not really thinking too much about running this business on kind of Ericsson alone basis, but really strategic priorities would be for a partnership or some sort of other transaction?
Börje Ekholm
That's correct.
Johannes Schaller
Understood. Thank you.
Börje Ekholm
Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Achal Sultania from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Peter Nyquist
Hi Achal.
Achal Sultania
Hi Peter. Good afternoon. So a couple of clarification questions from the morning's call. I think if I look at the U.S. trends, I think revenues were down 10%. Can you give us a sense of whether the RAN part of the business in the U.S. was actually flat? I am just trying to get a sense whether the trends in the U.S. are actually improving versus last year?
Carl Mellander
Yes. Hi Achal. Carl here. Yes, RAN market and sales flat. The main explanation for the 10% drop in sales in North America is really this managed services contract that we were talking about before.
Achal Sultania
Okay. And then just, you basically in one of your comments in the press release you talked about SEK10 billion headwind coming from low margin contracts that you have in managed services and network rollout. What should be assume for, as in this is from a base of 2016? Or this is from a base of 2017? This SEK10 billion impact?
Carl Mellander
Well, you should look at it, of course, from a 2016 number. And what we are saying here is that it's in order to give you some guidance on what the size of the business we are trying to change the terms of or possibly manage ourselves out of. And that's up to SEK10 billion. So it is to give you some sort of qualification to it.

Achal Sultania
Okay. But basically of that SEK10 billion, it's safe to assume that almost half of that would be this one large U.S. customer in that case?
Carl Mellander
No. That's already resolved, right. That already not part of it. It was not part of Q4 either.
Achal Sultania
Okay. No. I am sorry. I am still confused. Because I think the large U.S. customer you had, that contract expired I think in Q3 last year. So should we a 2016 base to measure this SEK10 billion headwind? Or should we use 2017 base?
Carl Mellander
Well, let's think about this, how to explain it. But of the contract volume, we had at the end of last year, we see that about SEK10 billion of them in NRO and managed services, we are in the process of renegotiating or changing the terms of. Is that clear?
Achal Sultania
Yes. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.
Peter Nyquist
Thank you. Operator, we are now open for the last question please.
Operator
And the last question will come from the line of Richard Kramer from Arete Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Peter Nyquist
Hi Richard.
Richard Kramer
Hi. Thanks. Two quick ones, just to sort of follow-up on some of the points that have been raised. I guess, Börje, for you the key question is, do you believe you have or are potentially continuingly losing business because of all the uncertainty and what's clearly extensive pending restructuring you have still to do in the business? And again in this sense, I am not sure if we should read this current announcement as an incremental or further need for restructuring? Or is this just sort of more urgency behind the plan that you laid out in late March? And Carl equally, can you tell us the SEK5.8 billion that you mentioned, is that the only cash component of restructuring we are likely to see over the next few years, because it seems that between the provisions and restructuring you have announced that we would have expected a good bit more? Thanks.
Börje Ekholm
Okay. If I start with mine, as a matter of fact we believe we have over the last five years actually experienced a loss of market share. What we are seeing now is we think that has flattened out during the last few quarters, partly due to the Ericsson Radio System, partly due to the other competitive product offerings we have. So we don't believe we have lost market share. But I think our numbers for the first quarter really shows the need to keep a very high pace at the restructuring we are doing and the bigger sense of urgency in the company.
Carl Mellander
Okay. So on the second question Richard, Carl here. The SEK5.8 billion refers to the SEK8.4 relating to the customer contracts. So to estimate the cash component but when it comes to normal restructuring charges, yes, of course it would be significantly higher and we estimate, as you saw that charge to the P&L fixed rate and the cash impact is rather similar to that.
Richard Kramer
And just to be clear, are you telling us that we shouldn't expect further, given the tone of this report and certainly Börje, the comments you made about IT and cloud in the first quarter and the legacy business there, isn't it prudent for all of us to expect further restructuring coming to resolve your dissatisfaction with the level of profitability over the course of the year beyond what you have announced in March?
Börje Ekholm
No. That's, in a way when we did the announcement in March on the fixed rate, you remember we raised the, what we think will be the normal restructuring at the time to SEK6 billion to SEK8 billion and that's in reflection of what we see we need to do on IT and cloud. That has not changed in the last three weeks.
Richard Kramer
Okay. Thanks.
Peter Nyquist
Thanks Richard. By that, we are closing the Q&A session and maybe Börje you want to have closing remarks.

Börje Ekholm
I want to say, it's been a tough quarter but I would also highlight that our network business, which is three quarters of our sales have been very stable, performed well and we have a clearly profitability issues in IT and cloud and media where we are taking actions in order to mitigate those and improve the profitability significantly for next year, but then establishing a new base beyond 2018. With that, thank you.
Peter Nyquist
Thank you Börje. And I thank you all for today.
Carl Mellander
Thank you.

	Geneva, Switzerland, January 24, 2011 -

	ST-Ericsson, a joint venture of STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) and Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), reported financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter
	ending December 31, 2010.




	Sales in the fourth quarter came in line with our expectations, even slightly better, said Gilles
	Delfassy ST-Ericsson president and CEO. New products that started to sell in 2010, which represented more than a quarter of our total sales in Q4, became a bigger contributor to our revenue growing more than 50 percent sequentially. Continued
	strong performance from our new 2G/EDGE platforms in addition to initial HSPA+ modem sales offset weakness in the TD-SCDMA market and the anticipated decrease in our legacy products.




	Operating loss increased sequentially mainly due to higher operating expenses reflecting anticipated seasonality and currency effects, as well as price erosion due to our ongoing legacy product
	transition. However, we also saw $13 million of savings as we completed our restructuring as planned and on time.




	Overall, 2010 was a pivotal
	year for ST-Ericsson. Today, we are well on our way to completing the transformation of our company like we set out to do - focusing on expanding our product portfolio to the smartphone and tablet markets, where we aim to be a leader with
	best-in-class modems and application solutions. In fact, we are seeing increasing traction in these markets with products such as our U8500 smartphone platform, which we plan to ramp in the second half of the year with several Tier 1 customers.




	In 2011, our focus is to deliver our exciting new products to customers and improve financial performance as we complete our transition.
	While our near-term outlook is challenging, we are making good progress and are confident that our work will put us on the path to market leadership and sustainable profitable growth.

	at the end of the fourth quarter was negative $82 million, which compares to positive $39 million at the end of the third quarter. During the fourth quarter the company sold trade receivables without
	recourse, of which $166 million were outstanding at the end of the quarter, representing a sequential decrease of $13 million.




	Inventory
	decreased by $20 million reaching $275 million at the end of the fourth quarter.





	Outlook





	For the first quarter 2011, the company expects net sales to decline sequentially, reflecting both the accelerating decline of legacy products and the
	effect of first quarter seasonality.

Lars Magnus Ericsson


Lars Magnus Ericsson began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm that made telegraph equipment for the Swedish government agency Telegrafverket. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson in central Stockholm and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.[4]
Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the Bell Telephone Company. He bought a number of Siemens telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and Swedish Railways. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as Rikstelefon to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or royalty problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.
Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to Scandinavia. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of brass, wire, ebonite, and magnet steel. Much of the walnut wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.
Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other Nordic countries.
The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.
In 1884, a multiple-switchboard manual telephone exchange was mostly copied from a design by C. E. Scribner at Western Electric. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held patent 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather "inspiration".[citation needed] They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.
In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named The Dachshund.
International expansion[edit]

An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of Nottingham, England, it is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.


As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the National Telephone Company was a major customer; by 1897 the UK sold 28% of its output there. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.[4]
Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. Mass production techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.
Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, Kellogg and Automatic Electric dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.
In December 1st, Ericsson announced laying off 160 people in the Nigerian offices and moving the jobs to India.[9]
Automatic equipment[edit]

Ericsson ignored the growth of automatic telephony in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.[4] World War I, the subsequent Great Depression, and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.[citation needed]
Shareholding changes[edit]
The acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by Ivar Kreuger, an international financier. The company was renamed Telefon AB LM Ericsson. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.[4]
In 1928, Ericsson began issuing "A" and "B" shares; an "A" share had 1000 votes against a "B" share. Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few "A" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of "B" shares, while maintaining the status quo of power distribution.[citation needed] In 1930, a second issue of "B"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of "A" and "B" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with security given in German state bonds. He then took a loan for his own company Kreuger & Toll from ITT Corporation (administered by Sosthenes Behn), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.[citation needed]
Ericsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.[citation needed] Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11 million[clarification needed] on the deal.[citation needed] When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.[citation needed]
Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.[citation needed] ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.[citation needed] ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.[citation needed] ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.[citation needed]
Wallenberg era begins[edit]
Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including Stockholms Enskilda Bank (now Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the Wallenberg family, and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson "A" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family arranged with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.[4]
Market development[edit]




The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.






The Ericsson DBH15 telephone, a successor of the DBH 1001 and redesigned in 1947 by Gerard Kiljan


In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.[4]
Negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.[citation needed] The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and switchgear. The Beeston factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.[citation needed] The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.[citation needed] The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.[citation needed]
Sales drives resumed after the Great Depression, but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.[citation needed]
Further development[edit]
Ericsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, MTA, in 1956.[10] It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the Ericofon. Ericsson crossbar switching equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries.[citation needed] In 1983 the company introduced the ERIPAX suite of network products and services.
1995–2003: emergence of the Internet[edit]
In the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology.[11] But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – "we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)".[12]
The growth of GSM, which became a de facto world standard, combined with Ericsson’s other mobile standards, such as D-AMPS and PDC, meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world’s mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188 million AXE lines in place or on order in 117 countries.[12] Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.[citation needed]
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called FOMA. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer Qualcomm promoted the alternative system CDMA2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999[13] when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm’s wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.[14]
Once the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet. It announced a partnership with Microsoft to combine its web browser and server software with Ericsson’s mobile Internet technologies.[15] The subsequent joint venture was dissolved in 2001 in the aftermath of the Internet and telecom crashes.[citation needed]
Ericsson got caught up in the Dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The company’s market value increased; its share price peaked at SEK 825 in March 2000, from a low of SEK 20 at the start of the 1990s.[16] Lars Ramqvist resigned as CEO in January 1998, and later became chairperson of the board. Sven-Christer Nilsson took over as CEO in early 1998, and led the company in a clearer IP direction. Under his leadership, the company's acquisitions including a share in US router company Juniper.[17]
Ericsson had become a leading player in networks and the production of mobile telephones, sharing top place with Nokia and Motorola during 1997.[18] Services were becoming increasingly important; Ericsson had offered network rollout services for many years, and had operated networks, but at the end of the 1990s the services operations were amalgamated into a services unit.[citation needed]
In June 1999, Kurt Hellström, the head of Ericsson’s mobile division, replaced Nilsson as CEO. Worldwide hype around the potential of the internet – and for Ericsson in particular the mobile internet – had inflated industry expectations.[citation needed] Operators in many Westernized countries used much of their capital bidding for 3G licenses, and could not afford the new networks required to use the spectrum they had acquired.[citation needed] The order intake that Ericsson and other telecom vendors had expected, and invested in preparing for, was disappointing, causing job losses and consolidations across the industry.[citation needed]
Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001. Over the coming year, sales to operators halved.[19] Mobile telephones became a burden; the company's telephones unit made a loss of SEK 24 million in 2000. A fire in a Philips chip factory in New Mexico in March 2000 caused severe disruption to Ericsson’s phone production,[20] dealing a coup de grâce to Ericsson’s mobile phone hopes. Mobile phones would be spun off into a joint venture with Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in October 2001.[21] Ericsson launched several rounds of restructuring, refinancing and job-cutting; during 2001, staff numbers fell from 107,000 to 85,000.[22] A further 20,000 went the next year,[23] and 11,000 more in 2003.[24] A new rights issue raised SEK 30 billion to keep the company afloat. The company had survived as mobile Internet started growing. With record profits, it was in better shape than many of its competitors.[25]
2003–2016: rebuilding and growing[edit]
The emergence of full mobile Internet began a period of growth for the global telecom industry, including Ericsson. After the launch of 3G services during 2003,[26][27] people started to access the Internet using their telephones.
Ericsson’s position as a supplier of GSM equipment to many major operators, and its pioneering role in the emerging 3G standards and associated technology, placed it at the forefront of many of the changes to come. The cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant the company could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again. After announcing in 2003 that it had returned to growth, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that dominated Ericsson’s corporate culture for several years.[citation needed]
During the cutbacks, Ericsson had reduced its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.[citation needed] Ericsson started a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments.[citation needed] The first of these was Marconi, a company dating back to the dawn of radio whose assets included a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services.[citation needed] Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS Telekommunikation (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008.[citation needed] Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies the same year.[28][29] Ericsson re-entered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel’s CDMA operations and assets in 2009.[citation needed] The acquisitions followed Ericsson’s general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that became more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks.[citation needed]40% of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks.[30] Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.[citation needed]
Ericsson was working on ways to improve WCDMA as operators were buying and rolling it out; it was the first generation of 3G access. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). It was initially deployed in the download version called HSDPA; the technology spread from the first test calls in the US in late 2005[31] to 59 commercial networks in September 2006.[32] HSPA would provide the world’s first mobile broadband.
In July 2016, Hans Vestberg stepped down as Ericsson's CEO, after a half-dozen years heading the company. Jan Frykhammar, who has been working for the company since 1991 will be stepping in as interim CEO as Ericsson searches for a full-time replacement.[33]
On October 26th, Ericsson announced its new CEO. Börje Ekholm has started on January 16, 2017 and interim CEO Jan Frykhammar steps down on the following day. [34]
Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation[edit]
Around 2000, companies and governments began to push for standards for mobile Internet. In May 2000, the European Commission created the Wireless Strategic Initiative,[35] a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, Nokia, Alcatel (France), and Siemens AG (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum in 2001.[citation needed] In December 1999, Microsoft and Ericsson announced a strategic partnership to combine the former's web browser and server software with the latter's mobile-internet technologies.[36] In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst with marked economic implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups. In the same year, Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply flash memory to Ericsson over the next three years.[37]
The short-lived joint venture called Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB, owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft, respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead.[38] The same month, Ericsson announced the launch of Sony Ericsson, a joint venture mobile telephone business, together with Sony Corporation.[39] Sony Ericsson remained in operation until February 2012, when Sony bought out Ericsson's share; Ericsson said it wanted to focus on the global wireless market as a whole.[40][41]
Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – Motorola (U.S.), Lucent Technologies (U.S.), Cisco Systems (U.S.), Marconi (UK), Siemens AG (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world. Ericsson's workforce worldwide fell during 2001 from 107,000 to 85,000.[42]
In September 2001, Ericsson purchased the remaining shares in EHPT from Hewlett Packard.[43] Founded in 1993, Ericsson Hewlett Packard Telecom (EHPT) was a Joint Venture made up of 60% Ericsson interests and 40% Hewlett-Packard interests.[citation needed]
In 2002, ICT investor losses topped $2 trillion and share prices fell by 95% until August that year. More than half a million people lost their jobs in the global telecom industry over the two years.[44] The collapse of U.S. carrier WorldCom, with more than $107 billion in assets, was the biggest in U.S. history.[45] The sector's problems caused bankruptcies and job losses, and led to changes in the leadership of a number of major companies. Ericsson made 20,000 more staff redundant and raised about $3 billion from its shareholders.[46] In June 2002, Infineon Technologies AG (then the sixth-largest semiconductor supplier and a subsidiary of Siemens AG) bought Ericsson’s microelectronics unit for $400 million.[47]
Co-operation with Hewlett-Packard did not end with EHPT; in 2003 Ericsson outsourced its IT to HP, which included Managed Services, Help Desk Support, Data Center Operations, and HP Utility Data Center. The contract was extended in 2008.[48] There have also been a number of joint Ericsson/HP Telecoms outsourcing deals with telecoms operators including H3G and Vodafone.[citation needed] In October 2005, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the troubled UK telecommunications manufacturer Marconi Company, including its brand name that dates back to the creation of the original Marconi Company by the "father of radio" Guglielmo Marconi.[49] In September 2006, Ericsson sold the greater part of its defense business Ericsson Microwave Systems, which mainly produced sensor and radar systems, to Saab AB, which renamed the company to Saab Microwave Systems.[50] The sale meant Saab Ericsson Space, previously a joint venture, was now fully owned by Saab. Not included in the sale to Saab was the National Security & Public Safety division, which was transferred to Ericsson with the sale.[citation needed]
In 2007, Ericsson acquired carrier edge-router maker Redback Networks, and then Entrisphere, a US-based company providing fiber-access technology.[51] In September 2007, Ericsson acquired an 84% interest in German customer-care and billing software firm LHS, a stake later raised to 100%.[52] In 2008, Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division[53] to Aastra Technologies, and acquired Tandberg Television, the television technology division[54] of Norwegian company Tandberg.
In 2009, Ericsson bought the CDMA2000 and LTE business of Nortel’s carrier networks division for USD 1.18 billion;[55] Bizitek, a Turkish business support systems integrator; the Estonian manufacturing operations of electronic manufacturing company Elcoteq; and completed its acquisition of LHS.[56] Acquisitions in 2010 included assets from the Strategy and Technology Group of inCode, a North American business and consulting-services company;[57] Nortel’s majority shareholding (50% plus one share) in LG-Nortel, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Nortel Networks providing sales, R&D and industrial capacity in South Korea, now known as Ericsson-LG; further Nortel carrier-division assets, relating from Nortel’s GSM business in the United States and Canada; Optimi Corporation, a U.S.–Spanish telecommunications vendor specializing in network optimization and management;[58] and Pride, a consulting and systems-integration company operating in Italy.
In 2011, Ericsson acquired manufacturing and research facilities, and staff from the Guangdong Nortel Telecommunication Equipment Company (GDNT)[59] as well as Nortel’s Multiservice Switch business.[60] It also formed a strategic alliance with Akamai Technologies to develop and market mobile cloud acceleration services.[citation needed] Ericsson acquired U.S. company Telcordia Technologies in January 2012,[61] an operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS) company.[62] In March, Ericsson announced it was buying the broadcast-services division of Technicolor, a media broadcast technology company.[citation needed] In April 2012 Ericsson completed the acquisition of BelAir Networks a strong Wi-Fi network technology company.[citation needed]
On 3 May 2013, Ericsson announced it would divest its power cable operations to Danish company NKT Holding.[63] On 1 July 2013, Ericsson announced it would acquire the media management company Red Bee Media, subject to regulatory approval.[64] The acquisition was completed on 9 May 2014.[65] In September 2013, Ericsson completed its acquisition of Microsoft's Mediaroom business and televisions services, originally announced in April the same year. The acquisition makes Ericsson the largest provider of IPTV and multi-screen services in the world, by market share; it was renamed Ericsson Mediaroom.[66] In September 2014, Ericsson acquired majority stake in Apcera for cloud policy compliance.[67]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of 2016[update], members of the board of directors of LM Ericsson were: Leif Johansson, Jacob Wallenberg, Kristin S. Rinne, Helena Stjernholm, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Börje Ekholm, Ulf J. Johansson, Mikael Lännqvist, Zlatko Hadzic, Kjell-Åke Soting, Nora Denzel, Kristin Skogen Lund, Pehr Claesson, Karin Åberg and Roger Svensson.[68]

Ericsson has structured its R&D in three levels depending on when products or technologies will be introduced to customers and users.[69] Its research and development organization is part of Group Function Technology and focuses on wireless access networks; radio access technologies; broadband technologies; packet technologies; multimedia technologies; services and software; EMF safety and sustainability; security and global services.[70] These areas cover different parts of the entire network architecture.
Group Function Technology holds research co-operations with several major universities and research institutes including: Lund University in Sweden, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and Beijing Institute of Technology in China.[71] Ericsson also holds research co-operations within several European research programs such as GigaWam and OASE.[72] Ericsson holds 33,000 granted patents, and is the number-one holder of GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WCDMA/HSPA, and LTE essential patents.[73]
Ericsson hosts a developer program called Ericsson Developer Connection[74] designed to encourage development of applications and services.[75] Ericsson also has an open innovation initiative for beta applications and beta API's & tools called Ericsson Labs.[citation needed] The company hosts several internal innovation competitions among its employees.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Ericsson’s business includes technology research, development, network and software development, and running and evolving operations.[70][76] and software[77][78] Ericsson offers end-to-end services for all major mobile communication standards,[79] and has four main business units.[80]
Business Area Networks (Earlier Business Unit Networks)[edit]
Business Unit Networks has been headed by Johan Wibergh since 2008. It develops network infrastructure for communication needs over mobile and fixed connections.[80] As of 1 July 2014, BNET has been divided into Business Unit Radio and Business Unit Cloud & IP.[81] Its products include radio base stations, radio network controllers, mobile switching centers and service application nodes. Operators use Ericsson products to migrate from 2G to 3G and, most recently, to 4G networks.[82]
The company's network division has been described as a driver in the development of 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE technology, future 5G and the evolution towards all-IP,[83] and it develops and deploys advanced LTE systems,[84] but it is still developing the older GSM,[85][86] WCDMA, and CDMA technologies.[87] The company's networks portfolio also includes core networks, microwave transport, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, fixed-access services for copper and fiber, and mobile broadband modules, several levels of fixed broadband access,[88][89] radio access networks from small pico cells to high-capacity macro cells, controllers for radio base stations, and core network nodes that interconnect radio access networks with other parts of the network.[citation needed] Ericsson Power Modules supplies direct current (DC)/DC converters and DC/DC regulators, mainly to the communications industry, for advanced applications, such as multiplexors, switches, routers and radio base stations.[90] Manufacturing is in China.
Business Unit Global Services[edit]
Since 2010, Magnus Mandersson has been Head of Business Unit Global Services.[91] It provides telecoms-related managed services, including taking responsibility for running an operator’s network and the related business support systems.[citation needed] The unit is active in 180 countries; it supplies managed services,[92] systems integration, consulting, network rollout, design and optimization, broadcast services, learning services and support.[93][94][95][96] The company also works with television and media, public safety, and utilities. Ericsson claims to manage networks that serve more than 1 billion subscribers worldwide,[97] and to support customer networks that serve more than 2.5 billion subscribers.
Business Unit Support Solutions[edit]
Per Borgklint has headed Business Unit Support Solutions since 2011.[91] Initially established in 2007, as Business Unit Multimedia, Ericsson announced a new strategy for its multimedia business in February 2012.[98] Its Business Unit Support Solutions now develops software for operations and business support systems (OSS and BSS), real-time, multi-screen and on-demand television and media, and for the emerging m-commerce eco-system. Ericsson claims a leading position in charging and billing, serving 1.6 billion people.[99]

OSS and BSS expanded after the integration of Telcordia,[100] and it focuses on Customer experience management including fulfilment, assurance, network optimization and real-time charging.
TV and media offers products that enable operators and content owners to sell multi-screen TV services.[101]
M-Commerce sells mobile e-commerce products,[102] for mobile operators and financial institutions offer mobile wallet services to consumers.[103] Ericsson has announced m-commerce deals with Western Union[104] and African wireless carrier MTN.[105]

Systems integration[edit]
Ericsson's systems integration offering currently[when?] consists of seven service offerings:[106]

Operations Support Systems

Network services[edit]
Ericsson's network rollout services employ in-house capabilities, subcontractors and central resources to make changes to live networks.[107] Services such as technology deployment, network transformation, and network optimization are also provided.[93]
Broadcast services[edit]
Ericsson's Broadcast Services deal with the playout of live and pre-recorded, commercial and public service television programmes, including presentation (continuity announcements), trailers, and ancillary access services such as closed-caption subtitles, audio description and in-vision sign language interpreters.[108] Its media management services consist of Managed Media Preparation and Managed Media Internet Delivery.[109]
Business Unit Modems[edit]
As of 7 May 2014, Robert Puskaric assumed the role as Vice President and Head of Business Unit Modems, succeeding Mats Norin who had the position since August 2013.[110] This unit designs and sells LTE multimode thin modems, including 2G, 3G and 4G interoperability.[111] This activity was transferred to Ericsson from ST-Ericsson when the new Modems organization was put in place.[112] The unit has developed products including the Ericsson M7000 series multimode modems which support LTE (FDD /TDD), HSPA+, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and EDGE. In September 2014, Ericsson announced it would stop developing modems, shutting a loss-making unit it took on after joint venture partner STMicroelectronics pulled out.[113]
Divested businesses[edit]
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) was a joint venture with Sony that merged the previous mobile telephone operations of both companies. It manufactured mobile telephones, accessories and personal computer (PC) cards. Sony Ericsson was responsible for product design and development, marketing, sales, distribution and customer services. On 16 February 2012, Sony announced it had completed the full acquisition of Sony Ericsson.[114]

Lars Magnus Ericsson


Lars Magnus Ericsson began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm that made telegraph equipment for the Swedish government agency Telegrafverket. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson in central Stockholm and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.[4]
Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the Bell Telephone Company. He bought a number of Siemens telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and Swedish Railways. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as Rikstelefon to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or royalty problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.
Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to Scandinavia. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of brass, wire, ebonite, and magnet steel. Much of the walnut wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.
Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other Nordic countries.
The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.
In 1884, a multiple-switchboard manual telephone exchange was mostly copied from a design by C. E. Scribner at Western Electric. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held patent 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather "inspiration".[citation needed] They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.
In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named The Dachshund.
International expansion[edit]

An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of Nottingham, England, it is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.


As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the National Telephone Company was a major customer; by 1897 the UK sold 28% of its output there. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.[4]
Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. Mass production techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.
Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, Kellogg and Automatic Electric dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.
In December 1st, Ericsson announced laying off 160 people in the Nigerian offices and moving the jobs to India.[9]
Automatic equipment[edit]

Ericsson ignored the growth of automatic telephony in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.[4] World War I, the subsequent Great Depression, and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.[citation needed]
Shareholding changes[edit]
The acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by Ivar Kreuger, an international financier. The company was renamed Telefon AB LM Ericsson. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.[4]
In 1928, Ericsson began issuing "A" and "B" shares; an "A" share had 1000 votes against a "B" share. Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few "A" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of "B" shares, while maintaining the status quo of power distribution.[citation needed] In 1930, a second issue of "B"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of "A" and "B" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with security given in German state bonds. He then took a loan for his own company Kreuger & Toll from ITT Corporation (administered by Sosthenes Behn), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.[citation needed]
Ericsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.[citation needed] Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11 million[clarification needed] on the deal.[citation needed] When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.[citation needed]
Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.[citation needed] ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.[citation needed] ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.[citation needed] ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.[citation needed]
Wallenberg era begins[edit]
Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including Stockholms Enskilda Bank (now Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the Wallenberg family, and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson "A" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family arranged with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.[4]
Market development[edit]




The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.






The Ericsson DBH15 telephone, a successor of the DBH 1001 and redesigned in 1947 by Gerard Kiljan


In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.[4]
Negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.[citation needed] The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and switchgear. The Beeston factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.[citation needed] The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.[citation needed] The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.[citation needed]
Sales drives resumed after the Great Depression, but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.[citation needed]
Further development[edit]
Ericsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, MTA, in 1956.[10] It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the Ericofon. Ericsson crossbar switching equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries.[citation needed] In 1983 the company introduced the ERIPAX suite of network products and services.
1995–2003: emergence of the Internet[edit]
In the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology.[11] But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – "we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)".[12]
The growth of GSM, which became a de facto world standard, combined with Ericsson’s other mobile standards, such as D-AMPS and PDC, meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world’s mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188 million AXE lines in place or on order in 117 countries.[12] Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.[citation needed]
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called FOMA. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer Qualcomm promoted the alternative system CDMA2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999[13] when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm’s wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.[14]
Once the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet. It announced a partnership with Microsoft to combine its web browser and server software with Ericsson’s mobile Internet technologies.[15] The subsequent joint venture was dissolved in 2001 in the aftermath of the Internet and telecom crashes.[citation needed]
Ericsson got caught up in the Dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The company’s market value increased; its share price peaked at SEK 825 in March 2000, from a low of SEK 20 at the start of the 1990s.[16] Lars Ramqvist resigned as CEO in January 1998, and later became chairperson of the board. Sven-Christer Nilsson took over as CEO in early 1998, and led the company in a clearer IP direction. Under his leadership, the company's acquisitions including a share in US router company Juniper.[17]
Ericsson had become a leading player in networks and the production of mobile telephones, sharing top place with Nokia and Motorola during 1997.[18] Services were becoming increasingly important; Ericsson had offered network rollout services for many years, and had operated networks, but at the end of the 1990s the services operations were amalgamated into a services unit.[citation needed]
In June 1999, Kurt Hellström, the head of Ericsson’s mobile division, replaced Nilsson as CEO. Worldwide hype around the potential of the internet – and for Ericsson in particular the mobile internet – had inflated industry expectations.[citation needed] Operators in many Westernized countries used much of their capital bidding for 3G licenses, and could not afford the new networks required to use the spectrum they had acquired.[citation needed] The order intake that Ericsson and other telecom vendors had expected, and invested in preparing for, was disappointing, causing job losses and consolidations across the industry.[citation needed]
Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001. Over the coming year, sales to operators halved.[19] Mobile telephones became a burden; the company's telephones unit made a loss of SEK 24 million in 2000. A fire in a Philips chip factory in New Mexico in March 2000 caused severe disruption to Ericsson’s phone production,[20] dealing a coup de grâce to Ericsson’s mobile phone hopes. Mobile phones would be spun off into a joint venture with Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in October 2001.[21] Ericsson launched several rounds of restructuring, refinancing and job-cutting; during 2001, staff numbers fell from 107,000 to 85,000.[22] A further 20,000 went the next year,[23] and 11,000 more in 2003.[24] A new rights issue raised SEK 30 billion to keep the company afloat. The company had survived as mobile Internet started growing. With record profits, it was in better shape than many of its competitors.[25]
2003–2016: rebuilding and growing[edit]
The emergence of full mobile Internet began a period of growth for the global telecom industry, including Ericsson. After the launch of 3G services during 2003,[26][27] people started to access the Internet using their telephones.
Ericsson’s position as a supplier of GSM equipment to many major operators, and its pioneering role in the emerging 3G standards and associated technology, placed it at the forefront of many of the changes to come. The cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant the company could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again. After announcing in 2003 that it had returned to growth, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that dominated Ericsson’s corporate culture for several years.[citation needed]
During the cutbacks, Ericsson had reduced its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.[citation needed] Ericsson started a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments.[citation needed] The first of these was Marconi, a company dating back to the dawn of radio whose assets included a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services.[citation needed] Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS Telekommunikation (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008.[citation needed] Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies the same year.[28][29] Ericsson re-entered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel’s CDMA operations and assets in 2009.[citation needed] The acquisitions followed Ericsson’s general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that became more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks.[citation needed]40% of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks.[30] Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.[citation needed]
Ericsson was working on ways to improve WCDMA as operators were buying and rolling it out; it was the first generation of 3G access. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). It was initially deployed in the download version called HSDPA; the technology spread from the first test calls in the US in late 2005[31] to 59 commercial networks in September 2006.[32] HSPA would provide the world’s first mobile broadband.
In July 2016, Hans Vestberg stepped down as Ericsson's CEO, after a half-dozen years heading the company. Jan Frykhammar, who has been working for the company since 1991 will be stepping in as interim CEO as Ericsson searches for a full-time replacement.[33]
On October 26th, Ericsson announced its new CEO. Börje Ekholm has started on January 16, 2017 and interim CEO Jan Frykhammar steps down on the following day. [34]
Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation[edit]
Around 2000, companies and governments began to push for standards for mobile Internet. In May 2000, the European Commission created the Wireless Strategic Initiative,[35] a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, Nokia, Alcatel (France), and Siemens AG (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum in 2001.[citation needed] In December 1999, Microsoft and Ericsson announced a strategic partnership to combine the former's web browser and server software with the latter's mobile-internet technologies.[36] In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst with marked economic implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups. In the same year, Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply flash memory to Ericsson over the next three years.[37]
The short-lived joint venture called Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB, owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft, respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead.[38] The same month, Ericsson announced the launch of Sony Ericsson, a joint venture mobile telephone business, together with Sony Corporation.[39] Sony Ericsson remained in operation until February 2012, when Sony bought out Ericsson's share; Ericsson said it wanted to focus on the global wireless market as a whole.[40][41]
Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – Motorola (U.S.), Lucent Technologies (U.S.), Cisco Systems (U.S.), Marconi (UK), Siemens AG (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world. Ericsson's workforce worldwide fell during 2001 from 107,000 to 85,000.[42]
In September 2001, Ericsson purchased the remaining shares in EHPT from Hewlett Packard.[43] Founded in 1993, Ericsson Hewlett Packard Telecom (EHPT) was a Joint Venture made up of 60% Ericsson interests and 40% Hewlett-Packard interests.[citation needed]
In 2002, ICT investor losses topped $2 trillion and share prices fell by 95% until August that year. More than half a million people lost their jobs in the global telecom industry over the two years.[44] The collapse of U.S. carrier WorldCom, with more than $107 billion in assets, was the biggest in U.S. history.[45] The sector's problems caused bankruptcies and job losses, and led to changes in the leadership of a number of major companies. Ericsson made 20,000 more staff redundant and raised about $3 billion from its shareholders.[46] In June 2002, Infineon Technologies AG (then the sixth-largest semiconductor supplier and a subsidiary of Siemens AG) bought Ericsson’s microelectronics unit for $400 million.[47]
Co-operation with Hewlett-Packard did not end with EHPT; in 2003 Ericsson outsourced its IT to HP, which included Managed Services, Help Desk Support, Data Center Operations, and HP Utility Data Center. The contract was extended in 2008.[48] There have also been a number of joint Ericsson/HP Telecoms outsourcing deals with telecoms operators including H3G and Vodafone.[citation needed] In October 2005, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the troubled UK telecommunications manufacturer Marconi Company, including its brand name that dates back to the creation of the original Marconi Company by the "father of radio" Guglielmo Marconi.[49] In September 2006, Ericsson sold the greater part of its defense business Ericsson Microwave Systems, which mainly produced sensor and radar systems, to Saab AB, which renamed the company to Saab Microwave Systems.[50] The sale meant Saab Ericsson Space, previously a joint venture, was now fully owned by Saab. Not included in the sale to Saab was the National Security & Public Safety division, which was transferred to Ericsson with the sale.[citation needed]
In 2007, Ericsson acquired carrier edge-router maker Redback Networks, and then Entrisphere, a US-based company providing fiber-access technology.[51] In September 2007, Ericsson acquired an 84% interest in German customer-care and billing software firm LHS, a stake later raised to 100%.[52] In 2008, Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division[53] to Aastra Technologies, and acquired Tandberg Television, the television technology division[54] of Norwegian company Tandberg.
In 2009, Ericsson bought the CDMA2000 and LTE business of Nortel’s carrier networks division for USD 1.18 billion;[55] Bizitek, a Turkish business support systems integrator; the Estonian manufacturing operations of electronic manufacturing company Elcoteq; and completed its acquisition of LHS.[56] Acquisitions in 2010 included assets from the Strategy and Technology Group of inCode, a North American business and consulting-services company;[57] Nortel’s majority shareholding (50% plus one share) in LG-Nortel, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Nortel Networks providing sales, R&D and industrial capacity in South Korea, now known as Ericsson-LG; further Nortel carrier-division assets, relating from Nortel’s GSM business in the United States and Canada; Optimi Corporation, a U.S.–Spanish telecommunications vendor specializing in network optimization and management;[58] and Pride, a consulting and systems-integration company operating in Italy.
In 2011, Ericsson acquired manufacturing and research facilities, and staff from the Guangdong Nortel Telecommunication Equipment Company (GDNT)[59] as well as Nortel’s Multiservice Switch business.[60] It also formed a strategic alliance with Akamai Technologies to develop and market mobile cloud acceleration services.[citation needed] Ericsson acquired U.S. company Telcordia Technologies in January 2012,[61] an operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS) company.[62] In March, Ericsson announced it was buying the broadcast-services division of Technicolor, a media broadcast technology company.[citation needed] In April 2012 Ericsson completed the acquisition of BelAir Networks a strong Wi-Fi network technology company.[citation needed]
On 3 May 2013, Ericsson announced it would divest its power cable operations to Danish company NKT Holding.[63] On 1 July 2013, Ericsson announced it would acquire the media management company Red Bee Media, subject to regulatory approval.[64] The acquisition was completed on 9 May 2014.[65] In September 2013, Ericsson completed its acquisition of Microsoft's Mediaroom business and televisions services, originally announced in April the same year. The acquisition makes Ericsson the largest provider of IPTV and multi-screen services in the world, by market share; it was renamed Ericsson Mediaroom.[66] In September 2014, Ericsson acquired majority stake in Apcera for cloud policy compliance.[67]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of 2016[update], members of the board of directors of LM Ericsson were: Leif Johansson, Jacob Wallenberg, Kristin S. Rinne, Helena Stjernholm, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Börje Ekholm, Ulf J. Johansson, Mikael Lännqvist, Zlatko Hadzic, Kjell-Åke Soting, Nora Denzel, Kristin Skogen Lund, Pehr Claesson, Karin Åberg and Roger Svensson.[68]

Group Function Technology holds research co-operations with several major universities and research institutes including: Lund University in Sweden, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and Beijing Institute of Technology in China.[71] Ericsson also holds research co-operations within several European research programs such as GigaWam and OASE.[72] Ericsson holds 33,000 granted patents, and is the number-one holder of GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WCDMA/HSPA, and LTE essential patents.[73]
Ericsson hosts a developer program called Ericsson Developer Connection[74] designed to encourage development of applications and services.[75] Ericsson also has an open innovation initiative for beta applications and beta API's & tools called Ericsson Labs.[citation needed] The company hosts several internal innovation competitions among its employees.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Ericsson’s business includes technology research, development, network and software development, and running and evolving operations.[70][76] and software[77][78] Ericsson offers end-to-end services for all major mobile communication standards,[79] and has four main business units.[80]
Business Area Networks (Earlier Business Unit Networks)[edit]
Business Unit Networks has been headed by Johan Wibergh since 2008. It develops network infrastructure for communication needs over mobile and fixed connections.[80] As of 1 July 2014, BNET has been divided into Business Unit Radio and Business Unit Cloud & IP.[81] Its products include radio base stations, radio network controllers, mobile switching centers and service application nodes. Operators use Ericsson products to migrate from 2G to 3G and, most recently, to 4G networks.[82]
The company's network division has been described as a driver in the development of 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE technology, future 5G and the evolution towards all-IP,[83] and it develops and deploys advanced LTE systems,[84] but it is still developing the older GSM,[85][86] WCDMA, and CDMA technologies.[87] The company's networks portfolio also includes core networks, microwave transport, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, fixed-access services for copper and fiber, and mobile broadband modules, several levels of fixed broadband access,[88][89] radio access networks from small pico cells to high-capacity macro cells, controllers for radio base stations, and core network nodes that interconnect radio access networks with other parts of the network.[citation needed] Ericsson Power Modules supplies direct current (DC)/DC converters and DC/DC regulators, mainly to the communications industry, for advanced applications, such as multiplexors, switches, routers and radio base stations.[90] Manufacturing is in China.
Business Unit Global Services[edit]
Since 2010, Magnus Mandersson has been Head of Business Unit Global Services.[91] It provides telecoms-related managed services, including taking responsibility for running an operator’s network and the related business support systems.[citation needed] The unit is active in 180 countries; it supplies managed services,[92] systems integration, consulting, network rollout, design and optimization, broadcast services, learning services and support.[93][94][95][96] The company also works with television and media, public safety, and utilities. Ericsson claims to manage networks that serve more than 1 billion subscribers worldwide,[97] and to support customer networks that serve more than 2.5 billion subscribers.
Business Unit Support Solutions[edit]
Per Borgklint has headed Business Unit Support Solutions since 2011.[91] Initially established in 2007, as Business Unit Multimedia, Ericsson announced a new strategy for its multimedia business in February 2012.[98] Its Business Unit Support Solutions now develops software for operations and business support systems (OSS and BSS), real-time, multi-screen and on-demand television and media, and for the emerging m-commerce eco-system. Ericsson claims a leading position in charging and billing, serving 1.6 billion people.[99]

OSS and BSS expanded after the integration of Telcordia,[100] and it focuses on Customer experience management including fulfilment, assurance, network optimization and real-time charging.
TV and media offers products that enable operators and content owners to sell multi-screen TV services.[101]
M-Commerce sells mobile e-commerce products,[102] for mobile operators and financial institutions offer mobile wallet services to consumers.[103] Ericsson has announced m-commerce deals with Western Union[104] and African wireless carrier MTN.[105]

Broadcast services[edit]
Ericsson's Broadcast Services deal with the playout of live and pre-recorded, commercial and public service television programmes, including presentation (continuity announcements), trailers, and ancillary access services such as closed-caption subtitles, audio description and in-vision sign language interpreters.[108] Its media management services consist of Managed Media Preparation and Managed Media Internet Delivery.[109]
Business Unit Modems[edit]
As of 7 May 2014, Robert Puskaric assumed the role as Vice President and Head of Business Unit Modems, succeeding Mats Norin who had the position since August 2013.[110] This unit designs and sells LTE multimode thin modems, including 2G, 3G and 4G interoperability.[111] This activity was transferred to Ericsson from ST-Ericsson when the new Modems organization was put in place.[112] The unit has developed products including the Ericsson M7000 series multimode modems which support LTE (FDD /TDD), HSPA+, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and EDGE. In September 2014, Ericsson announced it would stop developing modems, shutting a loss-making unit it took on after joint venture partner STMicroelectronics pulled out.[113]
Divested businesses[edit]
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) was a joint venture with Sony that merged the previous mobile telephone operations of both companies. It manufactured mobile telephones, accessories and personal computer (PC) cards. Sony Ericsson was responsible for product design and development, marketing, sales, distribution and customer services. On 16 February 2012, Sony announced it had completed the full acquisition of Sony Ericsson.[114]

Lars Magnus Ericsson


Lars Magnus Ericsson began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm that made telegraph equipment for the Swedish government agency Telegrafverket. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson in central Stockholm and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.[4]
Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the Bell Telephone Company. He bought a number of Siemens telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and Swedish Railways. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as Rikstelefon to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or royalty problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.
Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to Scandinavia. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of brass, wire, ebonite, and magnet steel. Much of the walnut wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.
Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other Nordic countries.
The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.
In 1884, a multiple-switchboard manual telephone exchange was mostly copied from a design by C. E. Scribner at Western Electric. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held patent 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather "inspiration".[citation needed] They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.
In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named The Dachshund.
International expansion[edit]

An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of Nottingham, England, it is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.


As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the National Telephone Company was a major customer; by 1897 the UK sold 28% of its output there. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.[4]
Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. Mass production techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.
Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, Kellogg and Automatic Electric dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.
In December 1st, Ericsson announced laying off 160 people in the Nigerian offices and moving the jobs to India.[9]
Automatic equipment[edit]

Ericsson ignored the growth of automatic telephony in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.[4] World War I, the subsequent Great Depression, and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.[citation needed]
Shareholding changes[edit]
The acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by Ivar Kreuger, an international financier. The company was renamed Telefon AB LM Ericsson. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.[4]
In 1928, Ericsson began issuing "A" and "B" shares; an "A" share had 1000 votes against a "B" share. Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few "A" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of "B" shares, while maintaining the status quo of power distribution.[citation needed] In 1930, a second issue of "B"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of "A" and "B" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with security given in German state bonds. He then took a loan for his own company Kreuger & Toll from ITT Corporation (administered by Sosthenes Behn), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.[citation needed]
Ericsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.[citation needed] Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11 million[clarification needed] on the deal.[citation needed] When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.[citation needed]
Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.[citation needed] ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.[citation needed] ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.[citation needed] ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.[citation needed]
Wallenberg era begins[edit]
Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including Stockholms Enskilda Bank (now Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the Wallenberg family, and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson "A" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family arranged with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.[4]
Market development[edit]




The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.[4]
Negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.[citation needed] The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and switchgear. The Beeston factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.[citation needed] The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.[citation needed] The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.[citation needed]
Sales drives resumed after the Great Depression, but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.[citation needed]
Further development[edit]
Ericsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, MTA, in 1956.[10] It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the Ericofon. Ericsson crossbar switching equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries.[citation needed] In 1983 the company introduced the ERIPAX suite of network products and services.
1995–2003: emergence of the Internet[edit]
In the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology.[11] But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – "we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)".[12]
The growth of GSM, which became a de facto world standard, combined with Ericsson’s other mobile standards, such as D-AMPS and PDC, meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world’s mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188 million AXE lines in place or on order in 117 countries.[12] Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.[citation needed]
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called FOMA. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer Qualcomm promoted the alternative system CDMA2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999[13] when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm’s wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.[14]
Once the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet. It announced a partnership with Microsoft to combine its web browser and server software with Ericsson’s mobile Internet technologies.[15] The subsequent joint venture was dissolved in 2001 in the aftermath of the Internet and telecom crashes.[citation needed]
Ericsson got caught up in the Dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The company’s market value increased; its share price peaked at SEK 825 in March 2000, from a low of SEK 20 at the start of the 1990s.[16] Lars Ramqvist resigned as CEO in January 1998, and later became chairperson of the board. Sven-Christer Nilsson took over as CEO in early 1998, and led the company in a clearer IP direction. Under his leadership, the company's acquisitions including a share in US router company Juniper.[17]
Ericsson had become a leading player in networks and the production of mobile telephones, sharing top place with Nokia and Motorola during 1997.[18] Services were becoming increasingly important; Ericsson had offered network rollout services for many years, and had operated networks, but at the end of the 1990s the services operations were amalgamated into a services unit.[citation needed]
In June 1999, Kurt Hellström, the head of Ericsson’s mobile division, replaced Nilsson as CEO. Worldwide hype around the potential of the internet – and for Ericsson in particular the mobile internet – had inflated industry expectations.[citation needed] Operators in many Westernized countries used much of their capital bidding for 3G licenses, and could not afford the new networks required to use the spectrum they had acquired.[citation needed] The order intake that Ericsson and other telecom vendors had expected, and invested in preparing for, was disappointing, causing job losses and consolidations across the industry.[citation needed]
Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001. Over the coming year, sales to operators halved.[19] Mobile telephones became a burden; the company's telephones unit made a loss of SEK 24 million in 2000. A fire in a Philips chip factory in New Mexico in March 2000 caused severe disruption to Ericsson’s phone production,[20] dealing a coup de grâce to Ericsson’s mobile phone hopes. Mobile phones would be spun off into a joint venture with Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in October 2001.[21] Ericsson launched several rounds of restructuring, refinancing and job-cutting; during 2001, staff numbers fell from 107,000 to 85,000.[22] A further 20,000 went the next year,[23] and 11,000 more in 2003.[24] A new rights issue raised SEK 30 billion to keep the company afloat. The company had survived as mobile Internet started growing. With record profits, it was in better shape than many of its competitors.[25]
2003–2016: rebuilding and growing[edit]
The emergence of full mobile Internet began a period of growth for the global telecom industry, including Ericsson. After the launch of 3G services during 2003,[26][27] people started to access the Internet using their telephones.
Ericsson’s position as a supplier of GSM equipment to many major operators, and its pioneering role in the emerging 3G standards and associated technology, placed it at the forefront of many of the changes to come. The cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant the company could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again. After announcing in 2003 that it had returned to growth, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that dominated Ericsson’s corporate culture for several years.[citation needed]
During the cutbacks, Ericsson had reduced its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.[citation needed] Ericsson started a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments.[citation needed] The first of these was Marconi, a company dating back to the dawn of radio whose assets included a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services.[citation needed] Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS Telekommunikation (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008.[citation needed] Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies the same year.[28][29] Ericsson re-entered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel’s CDMA operations and assets in 2009.[citation needed] The acquisitions followed Ericsson’s general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that became more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks.[citation needed]40% of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks.[30] Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.[citation needed]
Ericsson was working on ways to improve WCDMA as operators were buying and rolling it out; it was the first generation of 3G access. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). It was initially deployed in the download version called HSDPA; the technology spread from the first test calls in the US in late 2005[31] to 59 commercial networks in September 2006.[32] HSPA would provide the world’s first mobile broadband.
In July 2016, Hans Vestberg stepped down as Ericsson's CEO, after a half-dozen years heading the company. Jan Frykhammar, who has been working for the company since 1991 will be stepping in as interim CEO as Ericsson searches for a full-time replacement.[33]
On October 26th, Ericsson announced its new CEO. Börje Ekholm has started on January 16, 2017 and interim CEO Jan Frykhammar steps down on the following day. [34]
Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation[edit]
Around 2000, companies and governments began to push for standards for mobile Internet. In May 2000, the European Commission created the Wireless Strategic Initiative,[35] a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, Nokia, Alcatel (France), and Siemens AG (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum in 2001.[citation needed] In December 1999, Microsoft and Ericsson announced a strategic partnership to combine the former's web browser and server software with the latter's mobile-internet technologies.[36] In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst with marked economic implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups. In the same year, Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply flash memory to Ericsson over the next three years.[37]
The short-lived joint venture called Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB, owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft, respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead.[38] The same month, Ericsson announced the launch of Sony Ericsson, a joint venture mobile telephone business, together with Sony Corporation.[39] Sony Ericsson remained in operation until February 2012, when Sony bought out Ericsson's share; Ericsson said it wanted to focus on the global wireless market as a whole.[40][41]
Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – Motorola (U.S.), Lucent Technologies (U.S.), Cisco Systems (U.S.), Marconi (UK), Siemens AG (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world. Ericsson's workforce worldwide fell during 2001 from 107,000 to 85,000.[42]
In September 2001, Ericsson purchased the remaining shares in EHPT from Hewlett Packard.[43] Founded in 1993, Ericsson Hewlett Packard Telecom (EHPT) was a Joint Venture made up of 60% Ericsson interests and 40% Hewlett-Packard interests.[citation needed]
In 2002, ICT investor losses topped $2 trillion and share prices fell by 95% until August that year. More than half a million people lost their jobs in the global telecom industry over the two years.[44] The collapse of U.S. carrier WorldCom, with more than $107 billion in assets, was the biggest in U.S. history.[45] The sector's problems caused bankruptcies and job losses, and led to changes in the leadership of a number of major companies. Ericsson made 20,000 more staff redundant and raised about $3 billion from its shareholders.[46] In June 2002, Infineon Technologies AG (then the sixth-largest semiconductor supplier and a subsidiary of Siemens AG) bought Ericsson’s microelectronics unit for $400 million.[47]
Co-operation with Hewlett-Packard did not end with EHPT; in 2003 Ericsson outsourced its IT to HP, which included Managed Services, Help Desk Support, Data Center Operations, and HP Utility Data Center. The contract was extended in 2008.[48] There have also been a number of joint Ericsson/HP Telecoms outsourcing deals with telecoms operators including H3G and Vodafone.[citation needed] In October 2005, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the troubled UK telecommunications manufacturer Marconi Company, including its brand name that dates back to the creation of the original Marconi Company by the "father of radio" Guglielmo Marconi.[49] In September 2006, Ericsson sold the greater part of its defense business Ericsson Microwave Systems, which mainly produced sensor and radar systems, to Saab AB, which renamed the company to Saab Microwave Systems.[50] The sale meant Saab Ericsson Space, previously a joint venture, was now fully owned by Saab. Not included in the sale to Saab was the National Security & Public Safety division, which was transferred to Ericsson with the sale.[citation needed]
In 2007, Ericsson acquired carrier edge-router maker Redback Networks, and then Entrisphere, a US-based company providing fiber-access technology.[51] In September 2007, Ericsson acquired an 84% interest in German customer-care and billing software firm LHS, a stake later raised to 100%.[52] In 2008, Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division[53] to Aastra Technologies, and acquired Tandberg Television, the television technology division[54] of Norwegian company Tandberg.
In 2009, Ericsson bought the CDMA2000 and LTE business of Nortel’s carrier networks division for USD 1.18 billion;[55] Bizitek, a Turkish business support systems integrator; the Estonian manufacturing operations of electronic manufacturing company Elcoteq; and completed its acquisition of LHS.[56] Acquisitions in 2010 included assets from the Strategy and Technology Group of inCode, a North American business and consulting-services company;[57] Nortel’s majority shareholding (50% plus one share) in LG-Nortel, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Nortel Networks providing sales, R&D and industrial capacity in South Korea, now known as Ericsson-LG; further Nortel carrier-division assets, relating from Nortel’s GSM business in the United States and Canada; Optimi Corporation, a U.S.–Spanish telecommunications vendor specializing in network optimization and management;[58] and Pride, a consulting and systems-integration company operating in Italy.
In 2011, Ericsson acquired manufacturing and research facilities, and staff from the Guangdong Nortel Telecommunication Equipment Company (GDNT)[59] as well as Nortel’s Multiservice Switch business.[60] It also formed a strategic alliance with Akamai Technologies to develop and market mobile cloud acceleration services.[citation needed] Ericsson acquired U.S. company Telcordia Technologies in January 2012,[61] an operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS) company.[62] In March, Ericsson announced it was buying the broadcast-services division of Technicolor, a media broadcast technology company.[citation needed] In April 2012 Ericsson completed the acquisition of BelAir Networks a strong Wi-Fi network technology company.[citation needed]
On 3 May 2013, Ericsson announced it would divest its power cable operations to Danish company NKT Holding.[63] On 1 July 2013, Ericsson announced it would acquire the media management company Red Bee Media, subject to regulatory approval.[64] The acquisition was completed on 9 May 2014.[65] In September 2013, Ericsson completed its acquisition of Microsoft's Mediaroom business and televisions services, originally announced in April the same year. The acquisition makes Ericsson the largest provider of IPTV and multi-screen services in the world, by market share; it was renamed Ericsson Mediaroom.[66] In September 2014, Ericsson acquired majority stake in Apcera for cloud policy compliance.[67]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of 2016[update], members of the board of directors of LM Ericsson were: Leif Johansson, Jacob Wallenberg, Kristin S. Rinne, Helena Stjernholm, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Börje Ekholm, Ulf J. Johansson, Mikael Lännqvist, Zlatko Hadzic, Kjell-Åke Soting, Nora Denzel, Kristin Skogen Lund, Pehr Claesson, Karin Åberg and Roger Svensson.[68]
Research and development[edit]
Ericsson has structured its R&D in three levels depending on when products or technologies will be introduced to customers and users.[69] Its research and development organization is part of Group Function Technology and focuses on wireless access networks; radio access technologies; broadband technologies; packet technologies; multimedia technologies; services and software; EMF safety and sustainability; security and global services.[70] These areas cover different parts of the entire network architecture.
Group Function Technology holds research co-operations with several major universities and research institutes including: Lund University in Sweden, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and Beijing Institute of Technology in China.[71] Ericsson also holds research co-operations within several European research programs such as GigaWam and OASE.[72] Ericsson holds 33,000 granted patents, and is the number-one holder of GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WCDMA/HSPA, and LTE essential patents.[73]
Ericsson hosts a developer program called Ericsson Developer Connection[74] designed to encourage development of applications and services.[75] Ericsson also has an open innovation initiative for beta applications and beta API's & tools called Ericsson Labs.[citation needed] The company hosts several internal innovation competitions among its employees.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Ericsson’s business includes technology research, development, network and software development, and running and evolving operations.[70][76] and software[77][78] Ericsson offers end-to-end services for all major mobile communication standards,[79] and has four main business units.[80]
Business Area Networks (Earlier Business Unit Networks)[edit]
Business Unit Networks has been headed by Johan Wibergh since 2008. It develops network infrastructure for communication needs over mobile and fixed connections.[80] As of 1 July 2014, BNET has been divided into Business Unit Radio and Business Unit Cloud & IP.[81] Its products include radio base stations, radio network controllers, mobile switching centers and service application nodes. Operators use Ericsson products to migrate from 2G to 3G and, most recently, to 4G networks.[82]
The company's network division has been described as a driver in the development of 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE technology, future 5G and the evolution towards all-IP,[83] and it develops and deploys advanced LTE systems,[84] but it is still developing the older GSM,[85][86] WCDMA, and CDMA technologies.[87] The company's networks portfolio also includes core networks, microwave transport, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, fixed-access services for copper and fiber, and mobile broadband modules, several levels of fixed broadband access,[88][89] radio access networks from small pico cells to high-capacity macro cells, controllers for radio base stations, and core network nodes that interconnect radio access networks with other parts of the network.[citation needed] Ericsson Power Modules supplies direct current (DC)/DC converters and DC/DC regulators, mainly to the communications industry, for advanced applications, such as multiplexors, switches, routers and radio base stations.[90] Manufacturing is in China.
Business Unit Global Services[edit]
Since 2010, Magnus Mandersson has been Head of Business Unit Global Services.[91] It provides telecoms-related managed services, including taking responsibility for running an operator’s network and the related business support systems.[citation needed] The unit is active in 180 countries; it supplies managed services,[92] systems integration, consulting, network rollout, design and optimization, broadcast services, learning services and support.[93][94][95][96] The company also works with television and media, public safety, and utilities. Ericsson claims to manage networks that serve more than 1 billion subscribers worldwide,[97] and to support customer networks that serve more than 2.5 billion subscribers.
Business Unit Support Solutions[edit]
Per Borgklint has headed Business Unit Support Solutions since 2011.[91] Initially established in 2007, as Business Unit Multimedia, Ericsson announced a new strategy for its multimedia business in February 2012.[98] Its Business Unit Support Solutions now develops software for operations and business support systems (OSS and BSS), real-time, multi-screen and on-demand television and media, and for the emerging m-commerce eco-system. Ericsson claims a leading position in charging and billing, serving 1.6 billion people.[99]

OSS and BSS expanded after the integration of Telcordia,[100] and it focuses on Customer experience management including fulfilment, assurance, network optimization and real-time charging.
TV and media offers products that enable operators and content owners to sell multi-screen TV services.[101]
M-Commerce sells mobile e-commerce products,[102] for mobile operators and financial institutions offer mobile wallet services to consumers.[103] Ericsson has announced m-commerce deals with Western Union[104] and African wireless carrier MTN.[105]

Systems integration[edit]
Ericsson's systems integration offering currently[when?] consists of seven service offerings:[106]

Operations Support Systems

Network services[edit]
Ericsson's network rollout services employ in-house capabilities, subcontractors and central resources to make changes to live networks.[107] Services such as technology deployment, network transformation, and network optimization are also provided.[93]
Broadcast services[edit]
Ericsson's Broadcast Services deal with the playout of live and pre-recorded, commercial and public service television programmes, including presentation (continuity announcements), trailers, and ancillary access services such as closed-caption subtitles, audio description and in-vision sign language interpreters.[108] Its media management services consist of Managed Media Preparation and Managed Media Internet Delivery.[109]
Business Unit Modems[edit]
As of 7 May 2014, Robert Puskaric assumed the role as Vice President and Head of Business Unit Modems, succeeding Mats Norin who had the position since August 2013.[110] This unit designs and sells LTE multimode thin modems, including 2G, 3G and 4G interoperability.[111] This activity was transferred to Ericsson from ST-Ericsson when the new Modems organization was put in place.[112] The unit has developed products including the Ericsson M7000 series multimode modems which support LTE (FDD /TDD), HSPA+, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and EDGE. In September 2014, Ericsson announced it would stop developing modems, shutting a loss-making unit it took on after joint venture partner STMicroelectronics pulled out.[113]
Divested businesses[edit]
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) was a joint venture with Sony that merged the previous mobile telephone operations of both companies. It manufactured mobile telephones, accessories and personal computer (PC) cards. Sony Ericsson was responsible for product design and development, marketing, sales, distribution and customer services. On 16 February 2012, Sony announced it had completed the full acquisition of Sony Ericsson.[114]

Ericsson Mobile Platforms[edit]
Ericsson Mobile Platforms was a supplier of technology platforms for GSM/EDGE and WCDMA/HSPA platforms used in devices, such as mobile handsets and PC cards.[citation needed] Through Ericsson Mobile Platforms, Ericsson licensed open-standard, end-to-end interoperability-tested GSM/EDGE and WCDMA technology platforms.[citation needed] The product offering included reference designs, platform software, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs and development boards, development and test tools, training, support and documentation. Ericsson Mobile Platforms had operations at nine global locations, with main operations in Sweden.[citation needed]
The company existed for eight years; on 12 February 2009, Ericsson announced it would be merged with the mobile platform company of STMicroelectronics, ST-NXP Wireless, to create a 50/50 joint venture owned by Ericsson and STMicroelectronics.[116] This joint venture was divested in 2013 and remaining activities can be found in Ericsson Modems and STMicroelectronics. Ericsson Mobile Platform ceased being a legal entity early 2009.[citation needed]
Ericsson Enterprise[edit]
Starting in 1983 Ericsson Enterprise provided communications systems and services for businesses, public entities and educational institutions. It produced products for voice over Internet protocol (VoIP)-based private branch exchanges (PBX), wireless local area networks (WLAN), and mobile intranets. Ericsson Enterprise operated mainly from Sweden but also operated through regional units and other partners/distributors. In 2008 it was sold to Aastra.[117][118]
.mobi and mobile Internet[edit]
Ericsson was an official backer in the launch of the .mobi top level domain created specifically for the mobile internet.[119] Since the launch of .mobi in September 2006, Ericsson has launched SonyEricsson.mobi, the mobile portal of Sony Ericsson.

Lars Magnus Ericsson


Lars Magnus Ericsson began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm that made telegraph equipment for the Swedish government agency Telegrafverket. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson in central Stockholm and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.[4]
Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the Bell Telephone Company. He bought a number of Siemens telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and Swedish Railways. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as Rikstelefon to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or royalty problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.
Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to Scandinavia. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of brass, wire, ebonite, and magnet steel. Much of the walnut wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.
Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other Nordic countries.
The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.
In 1884, a multiple-switchboard manual telephone exchange was mostly copied from a design by C. E. Scribner at Western Electric. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held patent 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather "inspiration".[citation needed] They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.
In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named The Dachshund.

An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of Nottingham, England, it is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.


As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the National Telephone Company was a major customer; by 1897 the UK sold 28% of its output there. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.[4]
Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. Mass production techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.
Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, Kellogg and Automatic Electric dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.
In December 1st, Ericsson announced laying off 160 people in the Nigerian offices and moving the jobs to India.[9]
Automatic equipment[edit]

Ericsson ignored the growth of automatic telephony in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.[4] World War I, the subsequent Great Depression, and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.[citation needed]
Shareholding changes[edit]
The acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by Ivar Kreuger, an international financier. The company was renamed Telefon AB LM Ericsson. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.[4]
In 1928, Ericsson began issuing "A" and "B" shares; an "A" share had 1000 votes against a "B" share. Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few "A" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of "B" shares, while maintaining the status quo of power distribution.[citation needed] In 1930, a second issue of "B"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of "A" and "B" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with security given in German state bonds. He then took a loan for his own company Kreuger & Toll from ITT Corporation (administered by Sosthenes Behn), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.[citation needed]
Ericsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.[citation needed] Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11 million[clarification needed] on the deal.[citation needed] When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.[citation needed]
Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.[citation needed] ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.[citation needed] ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.[citation needed] ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.[citation needed]
Wallenberg era begins[edit]
Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including Stockholms Enskilda Bank (now Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the Wallenberg family, and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson "A" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family arranged with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.[4]
Market development[edit]




The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.[4]
Negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.[citation needed] The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and switchgear. The Beeston factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.[citation needed] The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.[citation needed] The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.[citation needed]
Sales drives resumed after the Great Depression, but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.[citation needed]
Further development[edit]
Ericsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, MTA, in 1956.[10] It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the Ericofon. Ericsson crossbar switching equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries.[citation needed] In 1983 the company introduced the ERIPAX suite of network products and services.
1995–2003: emergence of the Internet[edit]
In the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology.[11] But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – "we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)".[12]
The growth of GSM, which became a de facto world standard, combined with Ericsson’s other mobile standards, such as D-AMPS and PDC, meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world’s mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188 million AXE lines in place or on order in 117 countries.[12] Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.[citation needed]
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called FOMA. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer Qualcomm promoted the alternative system CDMA2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999[13] when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm’s wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.[14]
Once the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet. It announced a partnership with Microsoft to combine its web browser and server software with Ericsson’s mobile Internet technologies.[15] The subsequent joint venture was dissolved in 2001 in the aftermath of the Internet and telecom crashes.[citation needed]
Ericsson got caught up in the Dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The company’s market value increased; its share price peaked at SEK 825 in March 2000, from a low of SEK 20 at the start of the 1990s.[16] Lars Ramqvist resigned as CEO in January 1998, and later became chairperson of the board. Sven-Christer Nilsson took over as CEO in early 1998, and led the company in a clearer IP direction. Under his leadership, the company's acquisitions including a share in US router company Juniper.[17]
Ericsson had become a leading player in networks and the production of mobile telephones, sharing top place with Nokia and Motorola during 1997.[18] Services were becoming increasingly important; Ericsson had offered network rollout services for many years, and had operated networks, but at the end of the 1990s the services operations were amalgamated into a services unit.[citation needed]
In June 1999, Kurt Hellström, the head of Ericsson’s mobile division, replaced Nilsson as CEO. Worldwide hype around the potential of the internet – and for Ericsson in particular the mobile internet – had inflated industry expectations.[citation needed] Operators in many Westernized countries used much of their capital bidding for 3G licenses, and could not afford the new networks required to use the spectrum they had acquired.[citation needed] The order intake that Ericsson and other telecom vendors had expected, and invested in preparing for, was disappointing, causing job losses and consolidations across the industry.[citation needed]
Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001. Over the coming year, sales to operators halved.[19] Mobile telephones became a burden; the company's telephones unit made a loss of SEK 24 million in 2000. A fire in a Philips chip factory in New Mexico in March 2000 caused severe disruption to Ericsson’s phone production,[20] dealing a coup de grâce to Ericsson’s mobile phone hopes. Mobile phones would be spun off into a joint venture with Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in October 2001.[21] Ericsson launched several rounds of restructuring, refinancing and job-cutting; during 2001, staff numbers fell from 107,000 to 85,000.[22] A further 20,000 went the next year,[23] and 11,000 more in 2003.[24] A new rights issue raised SEK 30 billion to keep the company afloat. The company had survived as mobile Internet started growing. With record profits, it was in better shape than many of its competitors.[25]
2003–2016: rebuilding and growing[edit]
The emergence of full mobile Internet began a period of growth for the global telecom industry, including Ericsson. After the launch of 3G services during 2003,[26][27] people started to access the Internet using their telephones.
Ericsson’s position as a supplier of GSM equipment to many major operators, and its pioneering role in the emerging 3G standards and associated technology, placed it at the forefront of many of the changes to come. The cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant the company could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again. After announcing in 2003 that it had returned to growth, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that dominated Ericsson’s corporate culture for several years.[citation needed]
During the cutbacks, Ericsson had reduced its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.[citation needed] Ericsson started a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments.[citation needed] The first of these was Marconi, a company dating back to the dawn of radio whose assets included a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services.[citation needed] Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS Telekommunikation (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008.[citation needed] Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies the same year.[28][29] Ericsson re-entered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel’s CDMA operations and assets in 2009.[citation needed] The acquisitions followed Ericsson’s general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that became more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks.[citation needed]40% of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks.[30] Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.[citation needed]
Ericsson was working on ways to improve WCDMA as operators were buying and rolling it out; it was the first generation of 3G access. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). It was initially deployed in the download version called HSDPA; the technology spread from the first test calls in the US in late 2005[31] to 59 commercial networks in September 2006.[32] HSPA would provide the world’s first mobile broadband.
In July 2016, Hans Vestberg stepped down as Ericsson's CEO, after a half-dozen years heading the company. Jan Frykhammar, who has been working for the company since 1991 will be stepping in as interim CEO as Ericsson searches for a full-time replacement.[33]
On October 26th, Ericsson announced its new CEO. Börje Ekholm has started on January 16, 2017 and interim CEO Jan Frykhammar steps down on the following day. [34]
Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation[edit]
Around 2000, companies and governments began to push for standards for mobile Internet. In May 2000, the European Commission created the Wireless Strategic Initiative,[35] a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, Nokia, Alcatel (France), and Siemens AG (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum in 2001.[citation needed] In December 1999, Microsoft and Ericsson announced a strategic partnership to combine the former's web browser and server software with the latter's mobile-internet technologies.[36] In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst with marked economic implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups. In the same year, Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply flash memory to Ericsson over the next three years.[37]
The short-lived joint venture called Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB, owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft, respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead.[38] The same month, Ericsson announced the launch of Sony Ericsson, a joint venture mobile telephone business, together with Sony Corporation.[39] Sony Ericsson remained in operation until February 2012, when Sony bought out Ericsson's share; Ericsson said it wanted to focus on the global wireless market as a whole.[40][41]
Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – Motorola (U.S.), Lucent Technologies (U.S.), Cisco Systems (U.S.), Marconi (UK), Siemens AG (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world. Ericsson's workforce worldwide fell during 2001 from 107,000 to 85,000.[42]
In September 2001, Ericsson purchased the remaining shares in EHPT from Hewlett Packard.[43] Founded in 1993, Ericsson Hewlett Packard Telecom (EHPT) was a Joint Venture made up of 60% Ericsson interests and 40% Hewlett-Packard interests.[citation needed]
In 2002, ICT investor losses topped $2 trillion and share prices fell by 95% until August that year. More than half a million people lost their jobs in the global telecom industry over the two years.[44] The collapse of U.S. carrier WorldCom, with more than $107 billion in assets, was the biggest in U.S. history.[45] The sector's problems caused bankruptcies and job losses, and led to changes in the leadership of a number of major companies. Ericsson made 20,000 more staff redundant and raised about $3 billion from its shareholders.[46] In June 2002, Infineon Technologies AG (then the sixth-largest semiconductor supplier and a subsidiary of Siemens AG) bought Ericsson’s microelectronics unit for $400 million.[47]
Co-operation with Hewlett-Packard did not end with EHPT; in 2003 Ericsson outsourced its IT to HP, which included Managed Services, Help Desk Support, Data Center Operations, and HP Utility Data Center. The contract was extended in 2008.[48] There have also been a number of joint Ericsson/HP Telecoms outsourcing deals with telecoms operators including H3G and Vodafone.[citation needed] In October 2005, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the troubled UK telecommunications manufacturer Marconi Company, including its brand name that dates back to the creation of the original Marconi Company by the "father of radio" Guglielmo Marconi.[49] In September 2006, Ericsson sold the greater part of its defense business Ericsson Microwave Systems, which mainly produced sensor and radar systems, to Saab AB, which renamed the company to Saab Microwave Systems.[50] The sale meant Saab Ericsson Space, previously a joint venture, was now fully owned by Saab. Not included in the sale to Saab was the National Security & Public Safety division, which was transferred to Ericsson with the sale.[citation needed]
In 2007, Ericsson acquired carrier edge-router maker Redback Networks, and then Entrisphere, a US-based company providing fiber-access technology.[51] In September 2007, Ericsson acquired an 84% interest in German customer-care and billing software firm LHS, a stake later raised to 100%.[52] In 2008, Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division[53] to Aastra Technologies, and acquired Tandberg Television, the television technology division[54] of Norwegian company Tandberg.
In 2009, Ericsson bought the CDMA2000 and LTE business of Nortel’s carrier networks division for USD 1.18 billion;[55] Bizitek, a Turkish business support systems integrator; the Estonian manufacturing operations of electronic manufacturing company Elcoteq; and completed its acquisition of LHS.[56] Acquisitions in 2010 included assets from the Strategy and Technology Group of inCode, a North American business and consulting-services company;[57] Nortel’s majority shareholding (50% plus one share) in LG-Nortel, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Nortel Networks providing sales, R&D and industrial capacity in South Korea, now known as Ericsson-LG; further Nortel carrier-division assets, relating from Nortel’s GSM business in the United States and Canada; Optimi Corporation, a U.S.–Spanish telecommunications vendor specializing in network optimization and management;[58] and Pride, a consulting and systems-integration company operating in Italy.
In 2011, Ericsson acquired manufacturing and research facilities, and staff from the Guangdong Nortel Telecommunication Equipment Company (GDNT)[59] as well as Nortel’s Multiservice Switch business.[60] It also formed a strategic alliance with Akamai Technologies to develop and market mobile cloud acceleration services.[citation needed] Ericsson acquired U.S. company Telcordia Technologies in January 2012,[61] an operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS) company.[62] In March, Ericsson announced it was buying the broadcast-services division of Technicolor, a media broadcast technology company.[citation needed] In April 2012 Ericsson completed the acquisition of BelAir Networks a strong Wi-Fi network technology company.[citation needed]
On 3 May 2013, Ericsson announced it would divest its power cable operations to Danish company NKT Holding.[63] On 1 July 2013, Ericsson announced it would acquire the media management company Red Bee Media, subject to regulatory approval.[64] The acquisition was completed on 9 May 2014.[65] In September 2013, Ericsson completed its acquisition of Microsoft's Mediaroom business and televisions services, originally announced in April the same year. The acquisition makes Ericsson the largest provider of IPTV and multi-screen services in the world, by market share; it was renamed Ericsson Mediaroom.[66] In September 2014, Ericsson acquired majority stake in Apcera for cloud policy compliance.[67]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of 2016[update], members of the board of directors of LM Ericsson were: Leif Johansson, Jacob Wallenberg, Kristin S. Rinne, Helena Stjernholm, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Börje Ekholm, Ulf J. Johansson, Mikael Lännqvist, Zlatko Hadzic, Kjell-Åke Soting, Nora Denzel, Kristin Skogen Lund, Pehr Claesson, Karin Åberg and Roger Svensson.[68]
Research and development[edit]
Ericsson has structured its R&D in three levels depending on when products or technologies will be introduced to customers and users.[69] Its research and development organization is part of Group Function Technology and focuses on wireless access networks; radio access technologies; broadband technologies; packet technologies; multimedia technologies; services and software; EMF safety and sustainability; security and global services.[70] These areas cover different parts of the entire network architecture.
Group Function Technology holds research co-operations with several major universities and research institutes including: Lund University in Sweden, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and Beijing Institute of Technology in China.[71] Ericsson also holds research co-operations within several European research programs such as GigaWam and OASE.[72] Ericsson holds 33,000 granted patents, and is the number-one holder of GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WCDMA/HSPA, and LTE essential patents.[73]
Ericsson hosts a developer program called Ericsson Developer Connection[74] designed to encourage development of applications and services.[75] Ericsson also has an open innovation initiative for beta applications and beta API's & tools called Ericsson Labs.[citation needed] The company hosts several internal innovation competitions among its employees.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Ericsson’s business includes technology research, development, network and software development, and running and evolving operations.[70][76] and software[77][78] Ericsson offers end-to-end services for all major mobile communication standards,[79] and has four main business units.[80]
Business Area Networks (Earlier Business Unit Networks)[edit]
Business Unit Networks has been headed by Johan Wibergh since 2008. It develops network infrastructure for communication needs over mobile and fixed connections.[80] As of 1 July 2014, BNET has been divided into Business Unit Radio and Business Unit Cloud & IP.[81] Its products include radio base stations, radio network controllers, mobile switching centers and service application nodes. Operators use Ericsson products to migrate from 2G to 3G and, most recently, to 4G networks.[82]
The company's network division has been described as a driver in the development of 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE technology, future 5G and the evolution towards all-IP,[83] and it develops and deploys advanced LTE systems,[84] but it is still developing the older GSM,[85][86] WCDMA, and CDMA technologies.[87] The company's networks portfolio also includes core networks, microwave transport, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, fixed-access services for copper and fiber, and mobile broadband modules, several levels of fixed broadband access,[88][89] radio access networks from small pico cells to high-capacity macro cells, controllers for radio base stations, and core network nodes that interconnect radio access networks with other parts of the network.[citation needed] Ericsson Power Modules supplies direct current (DC)/DC converters and DC/DC regulators, mainly to the communications industry, for advanced applications, such as multiplexors, switches, routers and radio base stations.[90] Manufacturing is in China.
Business Unit Global Services[edit]
Since 2010, Magnus Mandersson has been Head of Business Unit Global Services.[91] It provides telecoms-related managed services, including taking responsibility for running an operator’s network and the related business support systems.[citation needed] The unit is active in 180 countries; it supplies managed services,[92] systems integration, consulting, network rollout, design and optimization, broadcast services, learning services and support.[93][94][95][96] The company also works with television and media, public safety, and utilities. Ericsson claims to manage networks that serve more than 1 billion subscribers worldwide,[97] and to support customer networks that serve more than 2.5 billion subscribers.
Business Unit Support Solutions[edit]
Per Borgklint has headed Business Unit Support Solutions since 2011.[91] Initially established in 2007, as Business Unit Multimedia, Ericsson announced a new strategy for its multimedia business in February 2012.[98] Its Business Unit Support Solutions now develops software for operations and business support systems (OSS and BSS), real-time, multi-screen and on-demand television and media, and for the emerging m-commerce eco-system. Ericsson claims a leading position in charging and billing, serving 1.6 billion people.[99]

OSS and BSS expanded after the integration of Telcordia,[100] and it focuses on Customer experience management including fulfilment, assurance, network optimization and real-time charging.
TV and media offers products that enable operators and content owners to sell multi-screen TV services.[101]
M-Commerce sells mobile e-commerce products,[102] for mobile operators and financial institutions offer mobile wallet services to consumers.[103] Ericsson has announced m-commerce deals with Western Union[104] and African wireless carrier MTN.[105]

Systems integration[edit]
Ericsson's systems integration offering currently[when?] consists of seven service offerings:[106]

Operations Support Systems
Business Support Systems
IP Networks and Architecture
TV, Applications and Service Delivery Platforms
Solution and Life-Cycle Management
Data Migration
Multi-Vendor Verification

Network services[edit]
Ericsson's network rollout services employ in-house capabilities, subcontractors and central resources to make changes to live networks.[107] Services such as technology deployment, network transformation, and network optimization are also provided.[93]
Broadcast services[edit]
Ericsson's Broadcast Services deal with the playout of live and pre-recorded, commercial and public service television programmes, including presentation (continuity announcements), trailers, and ancillary access services such as closed-caption subtitles, audio description and in-vision sign language interpreters.[108] Its media management services consist of Managed Media Preparation and Managed Media Internet Delivery.[109]
Business Unit Modems[edit]
As of 7 May 2014, Robert Puskaric assumed the role as Vice President and Head of Business Unit Modems, succeeding Mats Norin who had the position since August 2013.[110] This unit designs and sells LTE multimode thin modems, including 2G, 3G and 4G interoperability.[111] This activity was transferred to Ericsson from ST-Ericsson when the new Modems organization was put in place.[112] The unit has developed products including the Ericsson M7000 series multimode modems which support LTE (FDD /TDD), HSPA+, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and EDGE. In September 2014, Ericsson announced it would stop developing modems, shutting a loss-making unit it took on after joint venture partner STMicroelectronics pulled out.[113]

Ericsson Mobile Platforms[edit]
Ericsson Mobile Platforms was a supplier of technology platforms for GSM/EDGE and WCDMA/HSPA platforms used in devices, such as mobile handsets and PC cards.[citation needed] Through Ericsson Mobile Platforms, Ericsson licensed open-standard, end-to-end interoperability-tested GSM/EDGE and WCDMA technology platforms.[citation needed] The product offering included reference designs, platform software, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs and development boards, development and test tools, training, support and documentation. Ericsson Mobile Platforms had operations at nine global locations, with main operations in Sweden.[citation needed]
The company existed for eight years; on 12 February 2009, Ericsson announced it would be merged with the mobile platform company of STMicroelectronics, ST-NXP Wireless, to create a 50/50 joint venture owned by Ericsson and STMicroelectronics.[116] This joint venture was divested in 2013 and remaining activities can be found in Ericsson Modems and STMicroelectronics. Ericsson Mobile Platform ceased being a legal entity early 2009.[citation needed]
Ericsson Enterprise[edit]
Starting in 1983 Ericsson Enterprise provided communications systems and services for businesses, public entities and educational institutions. It produced products for voice over Internet protocol (VoIP)-based private branch exchanges (PBX), wireless local area networks (WLAN), and mobile intranets. Ericsson Enterprise operated mainly from Sweden but also operated through regional units and other partners/distributors. In 2008 it was sold to Aastra.[117][118]
.mobi and mobile Internet[edit]
Ericsson was an official backer in the launch of the .mobi top level domain created specifically for the mobile internet.[119] Since the launch of .mobi in September 2006, Ericsson has launched SonyEricsson.mobi, the mobile portal of Sony Ericsson.

Lars Magnus Ericsson


Lars Magnus Ericsson began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm that made telegraph equipment for the Swedish government agency Telegrafverket. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson in central Stockholm and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.[4]
Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the Bell Telephone Company. He bought a number of Siemens telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and Swedish Railways. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as Rikstelefon to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or royalty problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.
Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to Scandinavia. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of brass, wire, ebonite, and magnet steel. Much of the walnut wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.
Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other Nordic countries.
The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.
In 1884, a multiple-switchboard manual telephone exchange was mostly copied from a design by C. E. Scribner at Western Electric. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held patent 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather "inspiration".[citation needed] They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.
In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named The Dachshund.
International expansion[edit]

An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of Nottingham, England, it is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.


As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the National Telephone Company was a major customer; by 1897 the UK sold 28% of its output there. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.[4]
Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. Mass production techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.
Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, Kellogg and Automatic Electric dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.
In December 1st, Ericsson announced laying off 160 people in the Nigerian offices and moving the jobs to India.[9]
Automatic equipment[edit]

Ericsson ignored the growth of automatic telephony in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.[4] World War I, the subsequent Great Depression, and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.[citation needed]
Shareholding changes[edit]
The acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by Ivar Kreuger, an international financier. The company was renamed Telefon AB LM Ericsson. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.[4]
In 1928, Ericsson began issuing "A" and "B" shares; an "A" share had 1000 votes against a "B" share. Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few "A" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of "B" shares, while maintaining the status quo of power distribution.[citation needed] In 1930, a second issue of "B"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of "A" and "B" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with security given in German state bonds. He then took a loan for his own company Kreuger & Toll from ITT Corporation (administered by Sosthenes Behn), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.[citation needed]
Ericsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.[citation needed] Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11 million[clarification needed] on the deal.[citation needed] When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.[citation needed]
Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.[citation needed] ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.[citation needed] ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.[citation needed] ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.[citation needed]
Wallenberg era begins[edit]
Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including Stockholms Enskilda Bank (now Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the Wallenberg family, and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson "A" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family arranged with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.[4]
Market development[edit]




The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.[4]
Negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.[citation needed] The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and switchgear. The Beeston factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.[citation needed] The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.[citation needed] The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.[citation needed]
Sales drives resumed after the Great Depression, but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.[citation needed]
Further development[edit]
Ericsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, MTA, in 1956.[10] It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the Ericofon. Ericsson crossbar switching equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries.[citation needed] In 1983 the company introduced the ERIPAX suite of network products and services.
1995–2003: emergence of the Internet[edit]
In the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology.[11] But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – "we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)".[12]
The growth of GSM, which became a de facto world standard, combined with Ericsson’s other mobile standards, such as D-AMPS and PDC, meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world’s mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188 million AXE lines in place or on order in 117 countries.[12] Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.[citation needed]
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called FOMA. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer Qualcomm promoted the alternative system CDMA2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999[13] when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm’s wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.[14]
Once the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet. It announced a partnership with Microsoft to combine its web browser and server software with Ericsson’s mobile Internet technologies.[15] The subsequent joint venture was dissolved in 2001 in the aftermath of the Internet and telecom crashes.[citation needed]
Ericsson got caught up in the Dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The company’s market value increased; its share price peaked at SEK 825 in March 2000, from a low of SEK 20 at the start of the 1990s.[16] Lars Ramqvist resigned as CEO in January 1998, and later became chairperson of the board. Sven-Christer Nilsson took over as CEO in early 1998, and led the company in a clearer IP direction. Under his leadership, the company's acquisitions including a share in US router company Juniper.[17]
Ericsson had become a leading player in networks and the production of mobile telephones, sharing top place with Nokia and Motorola during 1997.[18] Services were becoming increasingly important; Ericsson had offered network rollout services for many years, and had operated networks, but at the end of the 1990s the services operations were amalgamated into a services unit.[citation needed]
In June 1999, Kurt Hellström, the head of Ericsson’s mobile division, replaced Nilsson as CEO. Worldwide hype around the potential of the internet – and for Ericsson in particular the mobile internet – had inflated industry expectations.[citation needed] Operators in many Westernized countries used much of their capital bidding for 3G licenses, and could not afford the new networks required to use the spectrum they had acquired.[citation needed] The order intake that Ericsson and other telecom vendors had expected, and invested in preparing for, was disappointing, causing job losses and consolidations across the industry.[citation needed]
Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001. Over the coming year, sales to operators halved.[19] Mobile telephones became a burden; the company's telephones unit made a loss of SEK 24 million in 2000. A fire in a Philips chip factory in New Mexico in March 2000 caused severe disruption to Ericsson’s phone production,[20] dealing a coup de grâce to Ericsson’s mobile phone hopes. Mobile phones would be spun off into a joint venture with Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in October 2001.[21] Ericsson launched several rounds of restructuring, refinancing and job-cutting; during 2001, staff numbers fell from 107,000 to 85,000.[22] A further 20,000 went the next year,[23] and 11,000 more in 2003.[24] A new rights issue raised SEK 30 billion to keep the company afloat. The company had survived as mobile Internet started growing. With record profits, it was in better shape than many of its competitors.[25]
2003–2016: rebuilding and growing[edit]
The emergence of full mobile Internet began a period of growth for the global telecom industry, including Ericsson. After the launch of 3G services during 2003,[26][27] people started to access the Internet using their telephones.
Ericsson’s position as a supplier of GSM equipment to many major operators, and its pioneering role in the emerging 3G standards and associated technology, placed it at the forefront of many of the changes to come. The cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant the company could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again. After announcing in 2003 that it had returned to growth, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that dominated Ericsson’s corporate culture for several years.[citation needed]
During the cutbacks, Ericsson had reduced its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.[citation needed] Ericsson started a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments.[citation needed] The first of these was Marconi, a company dating back to the dawn of radio whose assets included a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services.[citation needed] Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS Telekommunikation (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008.[citation needed] Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies the same year.[28][29] Ericsson re-entered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel’s CDMA operations and assets in 2009.[citation needed] The acquisitions followed Ericsson’s general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that became more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks.[citation needed]40% of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks.[30] Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.[citation needed]
Ericsson was working on ways to improve WCDMA as operators were buying and rolling it out; it was the first generation of 3G access. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). It was initially deployed in the download version called HSDPA; the technology spread from the first test calls in the US in late 2005[31] to 59 commercial networks in September 2006.[32] HSPA would provide the world’s first mobile broadband.
In July 2016, Hans Vestberg stepped down as Ericsson's CEO, after a half-dozen years heading the company. Jan Frykhammar, who has been working for the company since 1991 will be stepping in as interim CEO as Ericsson searches for a full-time replacement.[33]
On October 26th, Ericsson announced its new CEO. Börje Ekholm has started on January 16, 2017 and interim CEO Jan Frykhammar steps down on the following day. [34]
Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation[edit]
Around 2000, companies and governments began to push for standards for mobile Internet. In May 2000, the European Commission created the Wireless Strategic Initiative,[35] a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, Nokia, Alcatel (France), and Siemens AG (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum in 2001.[citation needed] In December 1999, Microsoft and Ericsson announced a strategic partnership to combine the former's web browser and server software with the latter's mobile-internet technologies.[36] In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst with marked economic implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups. In the same year, Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply flash memory to Ericsson over the next three years.[37]
The short-lived joint venture called Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB, owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft, respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead.[38] The same month, Ericsson announced the launch of Sony Ericsson, a joint venture mobile telephone business, together with Sony Corporation.[39] Sony Ericsson remained in operation until February 2012, when Sony bought out Ericsson's share; Ericsson said it wanted to focus on the global wireless market as a whole.[40][41]
Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – Motorola (U.S.), Lucent Technologies (U.S.), Cisco Systems (U.S.), Marconi (UK), Siemens AG (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world. Ericsson's workforce worldwide fell during 2001 from 107,000 to 85,000.[42]
In September 2001, Ericsson purchased the remaining shares in EHPT from Hewlett Packard.[43] Founded in 1993, Ericsson Hewlett Packard Telecom (EHPT) was a Joint Venture made up of 60% Ericsson interests and 40% Hewlett-Packard interests.[citation needed]
In 2002, ICT investor losses topped $2 trillion and share prices fell by 95% until August that year. More than half a million people lost their jobs in the global telecom industry over the two years.[44] The collapse of U.S. carrier WorldCom, with more than $107 billion in assets, was the biggest in U.S. history.[45] The sector's problems caused bankruptcies and job losses, and led to changes in the leadership of a number of major companies. Ericsson made 20,000 more staff redundant and raised about $3 billion from its shareholders.[46] In June 2002, Infineon Technologies AG (then the sixth-largest semiconductor supplier and a subsidiary of Siemens AG) bought Ericsson’s microelectronics unit for $400 million.[47]
Co-operation with Hewlett-Packard did not end with EHPT; in 2003 Ericsson outsourced its IT to HP, which included Managed Services, Help Desk Support, Data Center Operations, and HP Utility Data Center. The contract was extended in 2008.[48] There have also been a number of joint Ericsson/HP Telecoms outsourcing deals with telecoms operators including H3G and Vodafone.[citation needed] In October 2005, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the troubled UK telecommunications manufacturer Marconi Company, including its brand name that dates back to the creation of the original Marconi Company by the "father of radio" Guglielmo Marconi.[49] In September 2006, Ericsson sold the greater part of its defense business Ericsson Microwave Systems, which mainly produced sensor and radar systems, to Saab AB, which renamed the company to Saab Microwave Systems.[50] The sale meant Saab Ericsson Space, previously a joint venture, was now fully owned by Saab. Not included in the sale to Saab was the National Security & Public Safety division, which was transferred to Ericsson with the sale.[citation needed]
In 2007, Ericsson acquired carrier edge-router maker Redback Networks, and then Entrisphere, a US-based company providing fiber-access technology.[51] In September 2007, Ericsson acquired an 84% interest in German customer-care and billing software firm LHS, a stake later raised to 100%.[52] In 2008, Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division[53] to Aastra Technologies, and acquired Tandberg Television, the television technology division[54] of Norwegian company Tandberg.
In 2009, Ericsson bought the CDMA2000 and LTE business of Nortel’s carrier networks division for USD 1.18 billion;[55] Bizitek, a Turkish business support systems integrator; the Estonian manufacturing operations of electronic manufacturing company Elcoteq; and completed its acquisition of LHS.[56] Acquisitions in 2010 included assets from the Strategy and Technology Group of inCode, a North American business and consulting-services company;[57] Nortel’s majority shareholding (50% plus one share) in LG-Nortel, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Nortel Networks providing sales, R&D and industrial capacity in South Korea, now known as Ericsson-LG; further Nortel carrier-division assets, relating from Nortel’s GSM business in the United States and Canada; Optimi Corporation, a U.S.–Spanish telecommunications vendor specializing in network optimization and management;[58] and Pride, a consulting and systems-integration company operating in Italy.
In 2011, Ericsson acquired manufacturing and research facilities, and staff from the Guangdong Nortel Telecommunication Equipment Company (GDNT)[59] as well as Nortel’s Multiservice Switch business.[60] It also formed a strategic alliance with Akamai Technologies to develop and market mobile cloud acceleration services.[citation needed] Ericsson acquired U.S. company Telcordia Technologies in January 2012,[61] an operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS) company.[62] In March, Ericsson announced it was buying the broadcast-services division of Technicolor, a media broadcast technology company.[citation needed] In April 2012 Ericsson completed the acquisition of BelAir Networks a strong Wi-Fi network technology company.[citation needed]
On 3 May 2013, Ericsson announced it would divest its power cable operations to Danish company NKT Holding.[63] On 1 July 2013, Ericsson announced it would acquire the media management company Red Bee Media, subject to regulatory approval.[64] The acquisition was completed on 9 May 2014.[65] In September 2013, Ericsson completed its acquisition of Microsoft's Mediaroom business and televisions services, originally announced in April the same year. The acquisition makes Ericsson the largest provider of IPTV and multi-screen services in the world, by market share; it was renamed Ericsson Mediaroom.[66] In September 2014, Ericsson acquired majority stake in Apcera for cloud policy compliance.[67]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of 2016[update], members of the board of directors of LM Ericsson were: Leif Johansson, Jacob Wallenberg, Kristin S. Rinne, Helena Stjernholm, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Börje Ekholm, Ulf J. Johansson, Mikael Lännqvist, Zlatko Hadzic, Kjell-Åke Soting, Nora Denzel, Kristin Skogen Lund, Pehr Claesson, Karin Åberg and Roger Svensson.[68]
Research and development[edit]
Ericsson has structured its R&D in three levels depending on when products or technologies will be introduced to customers and users.[69] Its research and development organization is part of Group Function Technology and focuses on wireless access networks; radio access technologies; broadband technologies; packet technologies; multimedia technologies; services and software; EMF safety and sustainability; security and global services.[70] These areas cover different parts of the entire network architecture.
Group Function Technology holds research co-operations with several major universities and research institutes including: Lund University in Sweden, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and Beijing Institute of Technology in China.[71] Ericsson also holds research co-operations within several European research programs such as GigaWam and OASE.[72] Ericsson holds 33,000 granted patents, and is the number-one holder of GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WCDMA/HSPA, and LTE essential patents.[73]
Ericsson hosts a developer program called Ericsson Developer Connection[74] designed to encourage development of applications and services.[75] Ericsson also has an open innovation initiative for beta applications and beta API's & tools called Ericsson Labs.[citation needed] The company hosts several internal innovation competitions among its employees.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Ericsson’s business includes technology research, development, network and software development, and running and evolving operations.[70][76] and software[77][78] Ericsson offers end-to-end services for all major mobile communication standards,[79] and has four main business units.[80]
Business Area Networks (Earlier Business Unit Networks)[edit]
Business Unit Networks has been headed by Johan Wibergh since 2008. It develops network infrastructure for communication needs over mobile and fixed connections.[80] As of 1 July 2014, BNET has been divided into Business Unit Radio and Business Unit Cloud & IP.[81] Its products include radio base stations, radio network controllers, mobile switching centers and service application nodes. Operators use Ericsson products to migrate from 2G to 3G and, most recently, to 4G networks.[82]
The company's network division has been described as a driver in the development of 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE technology, future 5G and the evolution towards all-IP,[83] and it develops and deploys advanced LTE systems,[84] but it is still developing the older GSM,[85][86] WCDMA, and CDMA technologies.[87] The company's networks portfolio also includes core networks, microwave transport, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, fixed-access services for copper and fiber, and mobile broadband modules, several levels of fixed broadband access,[88][89] radio access networks from small pico cells to high-capacity macro cells, controllers for radio base stations, and core network nodes that interconnect radio access networks with other parts of the network.[citation needed] Ericsson Power Modules supplies direct current (DC)/DC converters and DC/DC regulators, mainly to the communications industry, for advanced applications, such as multiplexors, switches, routers and radio base stations.[90] Manufacturing is in China.
Business Unit Global Services[edit]
Since 2010, Magnus Mandersson has been Head of Business Unit Global Services.[91] It provides telecoms-related managed services, including taking responsibility for running an operator’s network and the related business support systems.[citation needed] The unit is active in 180 countries; it supplies managed services,[92] systems integration, consulting, network rollout, design and optimization, broadcast services, learning services and support.[93][94][95][96] The company also works with television and media, public safety, and utilities. Ericsson claims to manage networks that serve more than 1 billion subscribers worldwide,[97] and to support customer networks that serve more than 2.5 billion subscribers.
Business Unit Support Solutions[edit]
Per Borgklint has headed Business Unit Support Solutions since 2011.[91] Initially established in 2007, as Business Unit Multimedia, Ericsson announced a new strategy for its multimedia business in February 2012.[98] Its Business Unit Support Solutions now develops software for operations and business support systems (OSS and BSS), real-time, multi-screen and on-demand television and media, and for the emerging m-commerce eco-system. Ericsson claims a leading position in charging and billing, serving 1.6 billion people.[99]

OSS and BSS expanded after the integration of Telcordia,[100] and it focuses on Customer experience management including fulfilment, assurance, network optimization and real-time charging.
TV and media offers products that enable operators and content owners to sell multi-screen TV services.[101]
M-Commerce sells mobile e-commerce products,[102] for mobile operators and financial institutions offer mobile wallet services to consumers.[103] Ericsson has announced m-commerce deals with Western Union[104] and African wireless carrier MTN.[105]

Systems integration[edit]
Ericsson's systems integration offering currently[when?] consists of seven service offerings:[106]

Operations Support Systems
Business Support Systems
IP Networks and Architecture
TV, Applications and Service Delivery Platforms
Solution and Life-Cycle Management
Data Migration
Multi-Vendor Verification

Network services[edit]
Ericsson's network rollout services employ in-house capabilities, subcontractors and central resources to make changes to live networks.[107] Services such as technology deployment, network transformation, and network optimization are also provided.[93]
Broadcast services[edit]
Ericsson's Broadcast Services deal with the playout of live and pre-recorded, commercial and public service television programmes, including presentation (continuity announcements), trailers, and ancillary access services such as closed-caption subtitles, audio description and in-vision sign language interpreters.[108] Its media management services consist of Managed Media Preparation and Managed Media Internet Delivery.[109]
Business Unit Modems[edit]
As of 7 May 2014, Robert Puskaric assumed the role as Vice President and Head of Business Unit Modems, succeeding Mats Norin who had the position since August 2013.[110] This unit designs and sells LTE multimode thin modems, including 2G, 3G and 4G interoperability.[111] This activity was transferred to Ericsson from ST-Ericsson when the new Modems organization was put in place.[112] The unit has developed products including the Ericsson M7000 series multimode modems which support LTE (FDD /TDD), HSPA+, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and EDGE. In September 2014, Ericsson announced it would stop developing modems, shutting a loss-making unit it took on after joint venture partner STMicroelectronics pulled out.[113]
Divested businesses[edit]
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) was a joint venture with Sony that merged the previous mobile telephone operations of both companies. It manufactured mobile telephones, accessories and personal computer (PC) cards. Sony Ericsson was responsible for product design and development, marketing, sales, distribution and customer services. On 16 February 2012, Sony announced it had completed the full acquisition of Sony Ericsson.[114]

Ericsson Mobile Platforms was a supplier of technology platforms for GSM/EDGE and WCDMA/HSPA platforms used in devices, such as mobile handsets and PC cards.[citation needed] Through Ericsson Mobile Platforms, Ericsson licensed open-standard, end-to-end interoperability-tested GSM/EDGE and WCDMA technology platforms.[citation needed] The product offering included reference designs, platform software, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs and development boards, development and test tools, training, support and documentation. Ericsson Mobile Platforms had operations at nine global locations, with main operations in Sweden.[citation needed]
The company existed for eight years; on 12 February 2009, Ericsson announced it would be merged with the mobile platform company of STMicroelectronics, ST-NXP Wireless, to create a 50/50 joint venture owned by Ericsson and STMicroelectronics.[116] This joint venture was divested in 2013 and remaining activities can be found in Ericsson Modems and STMicroelectronics. Ericsson Mobile Platform ceased being a legal entity early 2009.[citation needed]
Ericsson Enterprise[edit]
Starting in 1983 Ericsson Enterprise provided communications systems and services for businesses, public entities and educational institutions. It produced products for voice over Internet protocol (VoIP)-based private branch exchanges (PBX), wireless local area networks (WLAN), and mobile intranets. Ericsson Enterprise operated mainly from Sweden but also operated through regional units and other partners/distributors. In 2008 it was sold to Aastra.[117][118]
.mobi and mobile Internet[edit]
Ericsson was an official backer in the launch of the .mobi top level domain created specifically for the mobile internet.[119] Since the launch of .mobi in September 2006, Ericsson has launched SonyEricsson.mobi, the mobile portal of Sony Ericsson.

Lars Magnus Ericsson


Lars Magnus Ericsson began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm that made telegraph equipment for the Swedish government agency Telegrafverket. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson in central Stockholm and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.[4]
Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the Bell Telephone Company. He bought a number of Siemens telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and Swedish Railways. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as Rikstelefon to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or royalty problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.
Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to Scandinavia. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of brass, wire, ebonite, and magnet steel. Much of the walnut wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.
Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other Nordic countries.
The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.
In 1884, a multiple-switchboard manual telephone exchange was mostly copied from a design by C. E. Scribner at Western Electric. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held patent 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather "inspiration".[citation needed] They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.
In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named The Dachshund.
International expansion[edit]

An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of Nottingham, England, it is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.


As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the National Telephone Company was a major customer; by 1897 the UK sold 28% of its output there. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.[4]
Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. Mass production techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.
Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, Kellogg and Automatic Electric dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.
In December 1st, Ericsson announced laying off 160 people in the Nigerian offices and moving the jobs to India.[9]
Automatic equipment[edit]

Ericsson ignored the growth of automatic telephony in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.[4] World War I, the subsequent Great Depression, and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.[citation needed]
Shareholding changes[edit]
The acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by Ivar Kreuger, an international financier. The company was renamed Telefon AB LM Ericsson. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.[4]
In 1928, Ericsson began issuing "A" and "B" shares; an "A" share had 1000 votes against a "B" share. Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few "A" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of "B" shares, while maintaining the status quo of power distribution.[citation needed] In 1930, a second issue of "B"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of "A" and "B" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with security given in German state bonds. He then took a loan for his own company Kreuger & Toll from ITT Corporation (administered by Sosthenes Behn), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.[citation needed]
Ericsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.[citation needed] Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11 million[clarification needed] on the deal.[citation needed] When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.[citation needed]
Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.[citation needed] ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.[citation needed] ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.[citation needed] ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.[citation needed]
Wallenberg era begins[edit]
Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including Stockholms Enskilda Bank (now Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the Wallenberg family, and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson "A" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family arranged with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.[4]
Market development[edit]




The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.[4]
Negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.[citation needed] The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and switchgear. The Beeston factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.[citation needed] The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.[citation needed] The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.[citation needed]
Sales drives resumed after the Great Depression, but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.[citation needed]
Further development[edit]
Ericsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, MTA, in 1956.[10] It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the Ericofon. Ericsson crossbar switching equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries.[citation needed] In 1983 the company introduced the ERIPAX suite of network products and services.
1995–2003: emergence of the Internet[edit]
In the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology.[11] But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – "we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)".[12]
The growth of GSM, which became a de facto world standard, combined with Ericsson’s other mobile standards, such as D-AMPS and PDC, meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world’s mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188 million AXE lines in place or on order in 117 countries.[12] Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.[citation needed]
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called FOMA. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer Qualcomm promoted the alternative system CDMA2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999[13] when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm’s wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.[14]
Once the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet. It announced a partnership with Microsoft to combine its web browser and server software with Ericsson’s mobile Internet technologies.[15] The subsequent joint venture was dissolved in 2001 in the aftermath of the Internet and telecom crashes.[citation needed]
Ericsson got caught up in the Dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The company’s market value increased; its share price peaked at SEK 825 in March 2000, from a low of SEK 20 at the start of the 1990s.[16] Lars Ramqvist resigned as CEO in January 1998, and later became chairperson of the board. Sven-Christer Nilsson took over as CEO in early 1998, and led the company in a clearer IP direction. Under his leadership, the company's acquisitions including a share in US router company Juniper.[17]
Ericsson had become a leading player in networks and the production of mobile telephones, sharing top place with Nokia and Motorola during 1997.[18] Services were becoming increasingly important; Ericsson had offered network rollout services for many years, and had operated networks, but at the end of the 1990s the services operations were amalgamated into a services unit.[citation needed]
In June 1999, Kurt Hellström, the head of Ericsson’s mobile division, replaced Nilsson as CEO. Worldwide hype around the potential of the internet – and for Ericsson in particular the mobile internet – had inflated industry expectations.[citation needed] Operators in many Westernized countries used much of their capital bidding for 3G licenses, and could not afford the new networks required to use the spectrum they had acquired.[citation needed] The order intake that Ericsson and other telecom vendors had expected, and invested in preparing for, was disappointing, causing job losses and consolidations across the industry.[citation needed]
Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001. Over the coming year, sales to operators halved.[19] Mobile telephones became a burden; the company's telephones unit made a loss of SEK 24 million in 2000. A fire in a Philips chip factory in New Mexico in March 2000 caused severe disruption to Ericsson’s phone production,[20] dealing a coup de grâce to Ericsson’s mobile phone hopes. Mobile phones would be spun off into a joint venture with Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in October 2001.[21] Ericsson launched several rounds of restructuring, refinancing and job-cutting; during 2001, staff numbers fell from 107,000 to 85,000.[22] A further 20,000 went the next year,[23] and 11,000 more in 2003.[24] A new rights issue raised SEK 30 billion to keep the company afloat. The company had survived as mobile Internet started growing. With record profits, it was in better shape than many of its competitors.[25]
2003–2016: rebuilding and growing[edit]
The emergence of full mobile Internet began a period of growth for the global telecom industry, including Ericsson. After the launch of 3G services during 2003,[26][27] people started to access the Internet using their telephones.
Ericsson’s position as a supplier of GSM equipment to many major operators, and its pioneering role in the emerging 3G standards and associated technology, placed it at the forefront of many of the changes to come. The cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant the company could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again. After announcing in 2003 that it had returned to growth, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that dominated Ericsson’s corporate culture for several years.[citation needed]
During the cutbacks, Ericsson had reduced its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.[citation needed] Ericsson started a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments.[citation needed] The first of these was Marconi, a company dating back to the dawn of radio whose assets included a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services.[citation needed] Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS Telekommunikation (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008.[citation needed] Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies the same year.[28][29] Ericsson re-entered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel’s CDMA operations and assets in 2009.[citation needed] The acquisitions followed Ericsson’s general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that became more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks.[citation needed]40% of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks.[30] Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.[citation needed]
Ericsson was working on ways to improve WCDMA as operators were buying and rolling it out; it was the first generation of 3G access. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). It was initially deployed in the download version called HSDPA; the technology spread from the first test calls in the US in late 2005[31] to 59 commercial networks in September 2006.[32] HSPA would provide the world’s first mobile broadband.
In July 2016, Hans Vestberg stepped down as Ericsson's CEO, after a half-dozen years heading the company. Jan Frykhammar, who has been working for the company since 1991 will be stepping in as interim CEO as Ericsson searches for a full-time replacement.[33]
On October 26th, Ericsson announced its new CEO. Börje Ekholm has started on January 16, 2017 and interim CEO Jan Frykhammar steps down on the following day. [34]
Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation[edit]
Around 2000, companies and governments began to push for standards for mobile Internet. In May 2000, the European Commission created the Wireless Strategic Initiative,[35] a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, Nokia, Alcatel (France), and Siemens AG (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum in 2001.[citation needed] In December 1999, Microsoft and Ericsson announced a strategic partnership to combine the former's web browser and server software with the latter's mobile-internet technologies.[36] In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst with marked economic implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups. In the same year, Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply flash memory to Ericsson over the next three years.[37]
The short-lived joint venture called Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB, owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft, respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead.[38] The same month, Ericsson announced the launch of Sony Ericsson, a joint venture mobile telephone business, together with Sony Corporation.[39] Sony Ericsson remained in operation until February 2012, when Sony bought out Ericsson's share; Ericsson said it wanted to focus on the global wireless market as a whole.[40][41]
Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – Motorola (U.S.), Lucent Technologies (U.S.), Cisco Systems (U.S.), Marconi (UK), Siemens AG (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world. Ericsson's workforce worldwide fell during 2001 from 107,000 to 85,000.[42]
In September 2001, Ericsson purchased the remaining shares in EHPT from Hewlett Packard.[43] Founded in 1993, Ericsson Hewlett Packard Telecom (EHPT) was a Joint Venture made up of 60% Ericsson interests and 40% Hewlett-Packard interests.[citation needed]
In 2002, ICT investor losses topped $2 trillion and share prices fell by 95% until August that year. More than half a million people lost their jobs in the global telecom industry over the two years.[44] The collapse of U.S. carrier WorldCom, with more than $107 billion in assets, was the biggest in U.S. history.[45] The sector's problems caused bankruptcies and job losses, and led to changes in the leadership of a number of major companies. Ericsson made 20,000 more staff redundant and raised about $3 billion from its shareholders.[46] In June 2002, Infineon Technologies AG (then the sixth-largest semiconductor supplier and a subsidiary of Siemens AG) bought Ericsson’s microelectronics unit for $400 million.[47]
Co-operation with Hewlett-Packard did not end with EHPT; in 2003 Ericsson outsourced its IT to HP, which included Managed Services, Help Desk Support, Data Center Operations, and HP Utility Data Center. The contract was extended in 2008.[48] There have also been a number of joint Ericsson/HP Telecoms outsourcing deals with telecoms operators including H3G and Vodafone.[citation needed] In October 2005, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the troubled UK telecommunications manufacturer Marconi Company, including its brand name that dates back to the creation of the original Marconi Company by the "father of radio" Guglielmo Marconi.[49] In September 2006, Ericsson sold the greater part of its defense business Ericsson Microwave Systems, which mainly produced sensor and radar systems, to Saab AB, which renamed the company to Saab Microwave Systems.[50] The sale meant Saab Ericsson Space, previously a joint venture, was now fully owned by Saab. Not included in the sale to Saab was the National Security & Public Safety division, which was transferred to Ericsson with the sale.[citation needed]
In 2007, Ericsson acquired carrier edge-router maker Redback Networks, and then Entrisphere, a US-based company providing fiber-access technology.[51] In September 2007, Ericsson acquired an 84% interest in German customer-care and billing software firm LHS, a stake later raised to 100%.[52] In 2008, Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division[53] to Aastra Technologies, and acquired Tandberg Television, the television technology division[54] of Norwegian company Tandberg.
In 2009, Ericsson bought the CDMA2000 and LTE business of Nortel’s carrier networks division for USD 1.18 billion;[55] Bizitek, a Turkish business support systems integrator; the Estonian manufacturing operations of electronic manufacturing company Elcoteq; and completed its acquisition of LHS.[56] Acquisitions in 2010 included assets from the Strategy and Technology Group of inCode, a North American business and consulting-services company;[57] Nortel’s majority shareholding (50% plus one share) in LG-Nortel, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Nortel Networks providing sales, R&D and industrial capacity in South Korea, now known as Ericsson-LG; further Nortel carrier-division assets, relating from Nortel’s GSM business in the United States and Canada; Optimi Corporation, a U.S.–Spanish telecommunications vendor specializing in network optimization and management;[58] and Pride, a consulting and systems-integration company operating in Italy.
In 2011, Ericsson acquired manufacturing and research facilities, and staff from the Guangdong Nortel Telecommunication Equipment Company (GDNT)[59] as well as Nortel’s Multiservice Switch business.[60] It also formed a strategic alliance with Akamai Technologies to develop and market mobile cloud acceleration services.[citation needed] Ericsson acquired U.S. company Telcordia Technologies in January 2012,[61] an operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS) company.[62] In March, Ericsson announced it was buying the broadcast-services division of Technicolor, a media broadcast technology company.[citation needed] In April 2012 Ericsson completed the acquisition of BelAir Networks a strong Wi-Fi network technology company.[citation needed]
On 3 May 2013, Ericsson announced it would divest its power cable operations to Danish company NKT Holding.[63] On 1 July 2013, Ericsson announced it would acquire the media management company Red Bee Media, subject to regulatory approval.[64] The acquisition was completed on 9 May 2014.[65] In September 2013, Ericsson completed its acquisition of Microsoft's Mediaroom business and televisions services, originally announced in April the same year. The acquisition makes Ericsson the largest provider of IPTV and multi-screen services in the world, by market share; it was renamed Ericsson Mediaroom.[66] In September 2014, Ericsson acquired majority stake in Apcera for cloud policy compliance.[67]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of 2016[update], members of the board of directors of LM Ericsson were: Leif Johansson, Jacob Wallenberg, Kristin S. Rinne, Helena Stjernholm, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Börje Ekholm, Ulf J. Johansson, Mikael Lännqvist, Zlatko Hadzic, Kjell-Åke Soting, Nora Denzel, Kristin Skogen Lund, Pehr Claesson, Karin Åberg and Roger Svensson.[68]
Research and development[edit]
Ericsson has structured its R&D in three levels depending on when products or technologies will be introduced to customers and users.[69] Its research and development organization is part of Group Function Technology and focuses on wireless access networks; radio access technologies; broadband technologies; packet technologies; multimedia technologies; services and software; EMF safety and sustainability; security and global services.[70] These areas cover different parts of the entire network architecture.
Group Function Technology holds research co-operations with several major universities and research institutes including: Lund University in Sweden, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and Beijing Institute of Technology in China.[71] Ericsson also holds research co-operations within several European research programs such as GigaWam and OASE.[72] Ericsson holds 33,000 granted patents, and is the number-one holder of GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WCDMA/HSPA, and LTE essential patents.[73]
Ericsson hosts a developer program called Ericsson Developer Connection[74] designed to encourage development of applications and services.[75] Ericsson also has an open innovation initiative for beta applications and beta API's & tools called Ericsson Labs.[citation needed] The company hosts several internal innovation competitions among its employees.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Ericsson’s business includes technology research, development, network and software development, and running and evolving operations.[70][76] and software[77][78] Ericsson offers end-to-end services for all major mobile communication standards,[79] and has four main business units.[80]
Business Area Networks (Earlier Business Unit Networks)[edit]
Business Unit Networks has been headed by Johan Wibergh since 2008. It develops network infrastructure for communication needs over mobile and fixed connections.[80] As of 1 July 2014, BNET has been divided into Business Unit Radio and Business Unit Cloud & IP.[81] Its products include radio base stations, radio network controllers, mobile switching centers and service application nodes. Operators use Ericsson products to migrate from 2G to 3G and, most recently, to 4G networks.[82]
The company's network division has been described as a driver in the development of 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE technology, future 5G and the evolution towards all-IP,[83] and it develops and deploys advanced LTE systems,[84] but it is still developing the older GSM,[85][86] WCDMA, and CDMA technologies.[87] The company's networks portfolio also includes core networks, microwave transport, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, fixed-access services for copper and fiber, and mobile broadband modules, several levels of fixed broadband access,[88][89] radio access networks from small pico cells to high-capacity macro cells, controllers for radio base stations, and core network nodes that interconnect radio access networks with other parts of the network.[citation needed] Ericsson Power Modules supplies direct current (DC)/DC converters and DC/DC regulators, mainly to the communications industry, for advanced applications, such as multiplexors, switches, routers and radio base stations.[90] Manufacturing is in China.
Business Unit Global Services[edit]
Since 2010, Magnus Mandersson has been Head of Business Unit Global Services.[91] It provides telecoms-related managed services, including taking responsibility for running an operator’s network and the related business support systems.[citation needed] The unit is active in 180 countries; it supplies managed services,[92] systems integration, consulting, network rollout, design and optimization, broadcast services, learning services and support.[93][94][95][96] The company also works with television and media, public safety, and utilities. Ericsson claims to manage networks that serve more than 1 billion subscribers worldwide,[97] and to support customer networks that serve more than 2.5 billion subscribers.
Business Unit Support Solutions[edit]
Per Borgklint has headed Business Unit Support Solutions since 2011.[91] Initially established in 2007, as Business Unit Multimedia, Ericsson announced a new strategy for its multimedia business in February 2012.[98] Its Business Unit Support Solutions now develops software for operations and business support systems (OSS and BSS), real-time, multi-screen and on-demand television and media, and for the emerging m-commerce eco-system. Ericsson claims a leading position in charging and billing, serving 1.6 billion people.[99]

OSS and BSS expanded after the integration of Telcordia,[100] and it focuses on Customer experience management including fulfilment, assurance, network optimization and real-time charging.
TV and media offers products that enable operators and content owners to sell multi-screen TV services.[101]
M-Commerce sells mobile e-commerce products,[102] for mobile operators and financial institutions offer mobile wallet services to consumers.[103] Ericsson has announced m-commerce deals with Western Union[104] and African wireless carrier MTN.[105]

Multi-Vendor Verification

Network services[edit]
Ericsson's network rollout services employ in-house capabilities, subcontractors and central resources to make changes to live networks.[107] Services such as technology deployment, network transformation, and network optimization are also provided.[93]
Broadcast services[edit]
Ericsson's Broadcast Services deal with the playout of live and pre-recorded, commercial and public service television programmes, including presentation (continuity announcements), trailers, and ancillary access services such as closed-caption subtitles, audio description and in-vision sign language interpreters.[108] Its media management services consist of Managed Media Preparation and Managed Media Internet Delivery.[109]
Business Unit Modems[edit]
As of 7 May 2014, Robert Puskaric assumed the role as Vice President and Head of Business Unit Modems, succeeding Mats Norin who had the position since August 2013.[110] This unit designs and sells LTE multimode thin modems, including 2G, 3G and 4G interoperability.[111] This activity was transferred to Ericsson from ST-Ericsson when the new Modems organization was put in place.[112] The unit has developed products including the Ericsson M7000 series multimode modems which support LTE (FDD /TDD), HSPA+, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and EDGE. In September 2014, Ericsson announced it would stop developing modems, shutting a loss-making unit it took on after joint venture partner STMicroelectronics pulled out.[113]
Divested businesses[edit]
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) was a joint venture with Sony that merged the previous mobile telephone operations of both companies. It manufactured mobile telephones, accessories and personal computer (PC) cards. Sony Ericsson was responsible for product design and development, marketing, sales, distribution and customer services. On 16 February 2012, Sony announced it had completed the full acquisition of Sony Ericsson.[114]

Ericsson Mobile Platforms[edit]
Ericsson Mobile Platforms was a supplier of technology platforms for GSM/EDGE and WCDMA/HSPA platforms used in devices, such as mobile handsets and PC cards.[citation needed] Through Ericsson Mobile Platforms, Ericsson licensed open-standard, end-to-end interoperability-tested GSM/EDGE and WCDMA technology platforms.[citation needed] The product offering included reference designs, platform software, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs and development boards, development and test tools, training, support and documentation. Ericsson Mobile Platforms had operations at nine global locations, with main operations in Sweden.[citation needed]
The company existed for eight years; on 12 February 2009, Ericsson announced it would be merged with the mobile platform company of STMicroelectronics, ST-NXP Wireless, to create a 50/50 joint venture owned by Ericsson and STMicroelectronics.[116] This joint venture was divested in 2013 and remaining activities can be found in Ericsson Modems and STMicroelectronics. Ericsson Mobile Platform ceased being a legal entity early 2009.[citation needed]
Ericsson Enterprise[edit]
Starting in 1983 Ericsson Enterprise provided communications systems and services for businesses, public entities and educational institutions. It produced products for voice over Internet protocol (VoIP)-based private branch exchanges (PBX), wireless local area networks (WLAN), and mobile intranets. Ericsson Enterprise operated mainly from Sweden but also operated through regional units and other partners/distributors. In 2008 it was sold to Aastra.[117][118]
.mobi and mobile Internet[edit]
Ericsson was an official backer in the launch of the .mobi top level domain created specifically for the mobile internet.[119] Since the launch of .mobi in September 2006, Ericsson has launched SonyEricsson.mobi, the mobile portal of Sony Ericsson.

Lars Magnus Ericsson


Lars Magnus Ericsson began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm that made telegraph equipment for the Swedish government agency Telegrafverket. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson in central Stockholm and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.[4]
Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the Bell Telephone Company. He bought a number of Siemens telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and Swedish Railways. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as Rikstelefon to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or royalty problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.
Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to Scandinavia. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of brass, wire, ebonite, and magnet steel. Much of the walnut wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.
Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other Nordic countries.
The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.
In 1884, a multiple-switchboard manual telephone exchange was mostly copied from a design by C. E. Scribner at Western Electric. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held patent 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather "inspiration".[citation needed] They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.
In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named The Dachshund.
International expansion[edit]

An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of Nottingham, England, it is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.


As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the National Telephone Company was a major customer; by 1897 the UK sold 28% of its output there. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.[4]
Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. Mass production techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.
Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, Kellogg and Automatic Electric dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.
In December 1st, Ericsson announced laying off 160 people in the Nigerian offices and moving the jobs to India.[9]
Automatic equipment[edit]

Ericsson ignored the growth of automatic telephony in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.[4] World War I, the subsequent Great Depression, and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.[citation needed]
Shareholding changes[edit]
The acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by Ivar Kreuger, an international financier. The company was renamed Telefon AB LM Ericsson. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.[4]
In 1928, Ericsson began issuing "A" and "B" shares; an "A" share had 1000 votes against a "B" share. Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few "A" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of "B" shares, while maintaining the status quo of power distribution.[citation needed] In 1930, a second issue of "B"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of "A" and "B" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with security given in German state bonds. He then took a loan for his own company Kreuger & Toll from ITT Corporation (administered by Sosthenes Behn), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.[citation needed]
Ericsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.[citation needed] Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11 million[clarification needed] on the deal.[citation needed] When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.[citation needed]
Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.[citation needed] ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.[citation needed] ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.[citation needed] ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.[citation needed]
Wallenberg era begins[edit]
Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including Stockholms Enskilda Bank (now Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the Wallenberg family, and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson "A" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family arranged with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.[4]
Market development[edit]




The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.[4]
Negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.[citation needed] The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and switchgear. The Beeston factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.[citation needed] The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.[citation needed] The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.[citation needed]
Sales drives resumed after the Great Depression, but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.[citation needed]
Further development[edit]
Ericsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, MTA, in 1956.[10] It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the Ericofon. Ericsson crossbar switching equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries.[citation needed] In 1983 the company introduced the ERIPAX suite of network products and services.
1995–2003: emergence of the Internet[edit]
In the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology.[11] But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – "we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)".[12]
The growth of GSM, which became a de facto world standard, combined with Ericsson’s other mobile standards, such as D-AMPS and PDC, meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world’s mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188 million AXE lines in place or on order in 117 countries.[12] Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.[citation needed]
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called FOMA. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer Qualcomm promoted the alternative system CDMA2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999[13] when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm’s wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.[14]
Once the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet. It announced a partnership with Microsoft to combine its web browser and server software with Ericsson’s mobile Internet technologies.[15] The subsequent joint venture was dissolved in 2001 in the aftermath of the Internet and telecom crashes.[citation needed]
Ericsson got caught up in the Dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The company’s market value increased; its share price peaked at SEK 825 in March 2000, from a low of SEK 20 at the start of the 1990s.[16] Lars Ramqvist resigned as CEO in January 1998, and later became chairperson of the board. Sven-Christer Nilsson took over as CEO in early 1998, and led the company in a clearer IP direction. Under his leadership, the company's acquisitions including a share in US router company Juniper.[17]
Ericsson had become a leading player in networks and the production of mobile telephones, sharing top place with Nokia and Motorola during 1997.[18] Services were becoming increasingly important; Ericsson had offered network rollout services for many years, and had operated networks, but at the end of the 1990s the services operations were amalgamated into a services unit.[citation needed]
In June 1999, Kurt Hellström, the head of Ericsson’s mobile division, replaced Nilsson as CEO. Worldwide hype around the potential of the internet – and for Ericsson in particular the mobile internet – had inflated industry expectations.[citation needed] Operators in many Westernized countries used much of their capital bidding for 3G licenses, and could not afford the new networks required to use the spectrum they had acquired.[citation needed] The order intake that Ericsson and other telecom vendors had expected, and invested in preparing for, was disappointing, causing job losses and consolidations across the industry.[citation needed]
Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001. Over the coming year, sales to operators halved.[19] Mobile telephones became a burden; the company's telephones unit made a loss of SEK 24 million in 2000. A fire in a Philips chip factory in New Mexico in March 2000 caused severe disruption to Ericsson’s phone production,[20] dealing a coup de grâce to Ericsson’s mobile phone hopes. Mobile phones would be spun off into a joint venture with Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in October 2001.[21] Ericsson launched several rounds of restructuring, refinancing and job-cutting; during 2001, staff numbers fell from 107,000 to 85,000.[22] A further 20,000 went the next year,[23] and 11,000 more in 2003.[24] A new rights issue raised SEK 30 billion to keep the company afloat. The company had survived as mobile Internet started growing. With record profits, it was in better shape than many of its competitors.[25]
2003–2016: rebuilding and growing[edit]
The emergence of full mobile Internet began a period of growth for the global telecom industry, including Ericsson. After the launch of 3G services during 2003,[26][27] people started to access the Internet using their telephones.
Ericsson’s position as a supplier of GSM equipment to many major operators, and its pioneering role in the emerging 3G standards and associated technology, placed it at the forefront of many of the changes to come. The cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant the company could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again. After announcing in 2003 that it had returned to growth, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that dominated Ericsson’s corporate culture for several years.[citation needed]
During the cutbacks, Ericsson had reduced its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.[citation needed] Ericsson started a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments.[citation needed] The first of these was Marconi, a company dating back to the dawn of radio whose assets included a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services.[citation needed] Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS Telekommunikation (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008.[citation needed] Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies the same year.[28][29] Ericsson re-entered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel’s CDMA operations and assets in 2009.[citation needed] The acquisitions followed Ericsson’s general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that became more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks.[citation needed]40% of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks.[30] Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.[citation needed]
Ericsson was working on ways to improve WCDMA as operators were buying and rolling it out; it was the first generation of 3G access. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). It was initially deployed in the download version called HSDPA; the technology spread from the first test calls in the US in late 2005[31] to 59 commercial networks in September 2006.[32] HSPA would provide the world’s first mobile broadband.
In July 2016, Hans Vestberg stepped down as Ericsson's CEO, after a half-dozen years heading the company. Jan Frykhammar, who has been working for the company since 1991 will be stepping in as interim CEO as Ericsson searches for a full-time replacement.[33]
On October 26th, Ericsson announced its new CEO. Börje Ekholm has started on January 16, 2017 and interim CEO Jan Frykhammar steps down on the following day. [34]
Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation[edit]
Around 2000, companies and governments began to push for standards for mobile Internet. In May 2000, the European Commission created the Wireless Strategic Initiative,[35] a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, Nokia, Alcatel (France), and Siemens AG (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum in 2001.[citation needed] In December 1999, Microsoft and Ericsson announced a strategic partnership to combine the former's web browser and server software with the latter's mobile-internet technologies.[36] In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst with marked economic implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups. In the same year, Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply flash memory to Ericsson over the next three years.[37]
The short-lived joint venture called Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB, owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft, respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead.[38] The same month, Ericsson announced the launch of Sony Ericsson, a joint venture mobile telephone business, together with Sony Corporation.[39] Sony Ericsson remained in operation until February 2012, when Sony bought out Ericsson's share; Ericsson said it wanted to focus on the global wireless market as a whole.[40][41]
Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – Motorola (U.S.), Lucent Technologies (U.S.), Cisco Systems (U.S.), Marconi (UK), Siemens AG (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world. Ericsson's workforce worldwide fell during 2001 from 107,000 to 85,000.[42]
In September 2001, Ericsson purchased the remaining shares in EHPT from Hewlett Packard.[43] Founded in 1993, Ericsson Hewlett Packard Telecom (EHPT) was a Joint Venture made up of 60% Ericsson interests and 40% Hewlett-Packard interests.[citation needed]
In 2002, ICT investor losses topped $2 trillion and share prices fell by 95% until August that year. More than half a million people lost their jobs in the global telecom industry over the two years.[44] The collapse of U.S. carrier WorldCom, with more than $107 billion in assets, was the biggest in U.S. history.[45] The sector's problems caused bankruptcies and job losses, and led to changes in the leadership of a number of major companies. Ericsson made 20,000 more staff redundant and raised about $3 billion from its shareholders.[46] In June 2002, Infineon Technologies AG (then the sixth-largest semiconductor supplier and a subsidiary of Siemens AG) bought Ericsson’s microelectronics unit for $400 million.[47]
Co-operation with Hewlett-Packard did not end with EHPT; in 2003 Ericsson outsourced its IT to HP, which included Managed Services, Help Desk Support, Data Center Operations, and HP Utility Data Center. The contract was extended in 2008.[48] There have also been a number of joint Ericsson/HP Telecoms outsourcing deals with telecoms operators including H3G and Vodafone.[citation needed] In October 2005, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the troubled UK telecommunications manufacturer Marconi Company, including its brand name that dates back to the creation of the original Marconi Company by the "father of radio" Guglielmo Marconi.[49] In September 2006, Ericsson sold the greater part of its defense business Ericsson Microwave Systems, which mainly produced sensor and radar systems, to Saab AB, which renamed the company to Saab Microwave Systems.[50] The sale meant Saab Ericsson Space, previously a joint venture, was now fully owned by Saab. Not included in the sale to Saab was the National Security & Public Safety division, which was transferred to Ericsson with the sale.[citation needed]
In 2007, Ericsson acquired carrier edge-router maker Redback Networks, and then Entrisphere, a US-based company providing fiber-access technology.[51] In September 2007, Ericsson acquired an 84% interest in German customer-care and billing software firm LHS, a stake later raised to 100%.[52] In 2008, Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division[53] to Aastra Technologies, and acquired Tandberg Television, the television technology division[54] of Norwegian company Tandberg.
In 2009, Ericsson bought the CDMA2000 and LTE business of Nortel’s carrier networks division for USD 1.18 billion;[55] Bizitek, a Turkish business support systems integrator; the Estonian manufacturing operations of electronic manufacturing company Elcoteq; and completed its acquisition of LHS.[56] Acquisitions in 2010 included assets from the Strategy and Technology Group of inCode, a North American business and consulting-services company;[57] Nortel’s majority shareholding (50% plus one share) in LG-Nortel, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Nortel Networks providing sales, R&D and industrial capacity in South Korea, now known as Ericsson-LG; further Nortel carrier-division assets, relating from Nortel’s GSM business in the United States and Canada; Optimi Corporation, a U.S.–Spanish telecommunications vendor specializing in network optimization and management;[58] and Pride, a consulting and systems-integration company operating in Italy.
In 2011, Ericsson acquired manufacturing and research facilities, and staff from the Guangdong Nortel Telecommunication Equipment Company (GDNT)[59] as well as Nortel’s Multiservice Switch business.[60] It also formed a strategic alliance with Akamai Technologies to develop and market mobile cloud acceleration services.[citation needed] Ericsson acquired U.S. company Telcordia Technologies in January 2012,[61] an operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS) company.[62] In March, Ericsson announced it was buying the broadcast-services division of Technicolor, a media broadcast technology company.[citation needed] In April 2012 Ericsson completed the acquisition of BelAir Networks a strong Wi-Fi network technology company.[citation needed]
On 3 May 2013, Ericsson announced it would divest its power cable operations to Danish company NKT Holding.[63] On 1 July 2013, Ericsson announced it would acquire the media management company Red Bee Media, subject to regulatory approval.[64] The acquisition was completed on 9 May 2014.[65] In September 2013, Ericsson completed its acquisition of Microsoft's Mediaroom business and televisions services, originally announced in April the same year. The acquisition makes Ericsson the largest provider of IPTV and multi-screen services in the world, by market share; it was renamed Ericsson Mediaroom.[66] In September 2014, Ericsson acquired majority stake in Apcera for cloud policy compliance.[67]

Johansson, Mikael Lännqvist, Zlatko Hadzic, Kjell-Åke Soting, Nora Denzel, Kristin Skogen Lund, Pehr Claesson, Karin Åberg and Roger Svensson.[68]
Research and development[edit]
Ericsson has structured its R&D in three levels depending on when products or technologies will be introduced to customers and users.[69] Its research and development organization is part of Group Function Technology and focuses on wireless access networks; radio access technologies; broadband technologies; packet technologies; multimedia technologies; services and software; EMF safety and sustainability; security and global services.[70] These areas cover different parts of the entire network architecture.
Group Function Technology holds research co-operations with several major universities and research institutes including: Lund University in Sweden, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and Beijing Institute of Technology in China.[71] Ericsson also holds research co-operations within several European research programs such as GigaWam and OASE.[72] Ericsson holds 33,000 granted patents, and is the number-one holder of GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WCDMA/HSPA, and LTE essential patents.[73]
Ericsson hosts a developer program called Ericsson Developer Connection[74] designed to encourage development of applications and services.[75] Ericsson also has an open innovation initiative for beta applications and beta API's & tools called Ericsson Labs.[citation needed] The company hosts several internal innovation competitions among its employees.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Ericsson’s business includes technology research, development, network and software development, and running and evolving operations.[70][76] and software[77][78] Ericsson offers end-to-end services for all major mobile communication standards,[79] and has four main business units.[80]
Business Area Networks (Earlier Business Unit Networks)[edit]
Business Unit Networks has been headed by Johan Wibergh since 2008. It develops network infrastructure for communication needs over mobile and fixed connections.[80] As of 1 July 2014, BNET has been divided into Business Unit Radio and Business Unit Cloud & IP.[81] Its products include radio base stations, radio network controllers, mobile switching centers and service application nodes. Operators use Ericsson products to migrate from 2G to 3G and, most recently, to 4G networks.[82]
The company's network division has been described as a driver in the development of 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE technology, future 5G and the evolution towards all-IP,[83] and it develops and deploys advanced LTE systems,[84] but it is still developing the older GSM,[85][86] WCDMA, and CDMA technologies.[87] The company's networks portfolio also includes core networks, microwave transport, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, fixed-access services for copper and fiber, and mobile broadband modules, several levels of fixed broadband access,[88][89] radio access networks from small pico cells to high-capacity macro cells, controllers for radio base stations, and core network nodes that interconnect radio access networks with other parts of the network.[citation needed] Ericsson Power Modules supplies direct current (DC)/DC converters and DC/DC regulators, mainly to the communications industry, for advanced applications, such as multiplexors, switches, routers and radio base stations.[90] Manufacturing is in China.
Business Unit Global Services[edit]
Since 2010, Magnus Mandersson has been Head of Business Unit Global Services.[91] It provides telecoms-related managed services, including taking responsibility for running an operator’s network and the related business support systems.[citation needed] The unit is active in 180 countries; it supplies managed services,[92] systems integration, consulting, network rollout, design and optimization, broadcast services, learning services and support.[93][94][95][96] The company also works with television and media, public safety, and utilities. Ericsson claims to manage networks that serve more than 1 billion subscribers worldwide,[97] and to support customer networks that serve more than 2.5 billion subscribers.
Business Unit Support Solutions[edit]
Per Borgklint has headed Business Unit Support Solutions since 2011.[91] Initially established in 2007, as Business Unit Multimedia, Ericsson announced a new strategy for its multimedia business in February 2012.[98] Its Business Unit Support Solutions now develops software for operations and business support systems (OSS and BSS), real-time, multi-screen and on-demand television and media, and for the emerging m-commerce eco-system. Ericsson claims a leading position in charging and billing, serving 1.6 billion people.[99]

OSS and BSS expanded after the integration of Telcordia,[100] and it focuses on Customer experience management including fulfilment, assurance, network optimization and real-time charging.
TV and media offers products that enable operators and content owners to sell multi-screen TV services.[101]
M-Commerce sells mobile e-commerce products,[102] for mobile operators and financial institutions offer mobile wallet services to consumers.[103] Ericsson has announced m-commerce deals with Western Union[104] and African wireless carrier MTN.[105]

Systems integration[edit]
Ericsson's systems integration offering currently[when?] consists of seven service offerings:[106]

Operations Support Systems
Business Support Systems
IP Networks and Architecture
TV, Applications and Service Delivery Platforms
Solution and Life-Cycle Management
Data Migration
Multi-Vendor Verification

Network services[edit]
Ericsson's network rollout services employ in-house capabilities, subcontractors and central resources to make changes to live networks.[107] Services such as technology deployment, network transformation, and network optimization are also provided.[93]
Broadcast services[edit]
Ericsson's Broadcast Services deal with the playout of live and pre-recorded, commercial and public service television programmes, including presentation (continuity announcements), trailers, and ancillary access services such as closed-caption subtitles, audio description and in-vision sign language interpreters.[108] Its media management services consist of Managed Media Preparation and Managed Media Internet Delivery.[109]
Business Unit Modems[edit]
As of 7 May 2014, Robert Puskaric assumed the role as Vice President and Head of Business Unit Modems, succeeding Mats Norin who had the position since August 2013.[110] This unit designs and sells LTE multimode thin modems, including 2G, 3G and 4G interoperability.[111] This activity was transferred to Ericsson from ST-Ericsson when the new Modems organization was put in place.[112] The unit has developed products including the Ericsson M7000 series multimode modems which support LTE (FDD /TDD), HSPA+, HSPA, TD-SCDMA and EDGE. In September 2014, Ericsson announced it would stop developing modems, shutting a loss-making unit it took on after joint venture partner STMicroelectronics pulled out.[113]
Divested businesses[edit]
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) was a joint venture with Sony that merged the previous mobile telephone operations of both companies. It manufactured mobile telephones, accessories and personal computer (PC) cards. Sony Ericsson was responsible for product design and development, marketing, sales, distribution and customer services. On 16 February 2012, Sony announced it had completed the full acquisition of Sony Ericsson.[114]

During the second quarter of 2010, Ericsson reported sales declined 8% year-over-year to 48 billion SEK. Sales in Global Services were flat due to decline in network rollout although Professional Services increased 5%. Group sales increased sequentially by 6%. Operators showed a continued strong demand for mobile broadband driven by smartphone and laptop usage. However, sales were impacted by continued industry component shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Gross margin improved year-over-year and sequentially due to business mix and efficiency gains. Cash flow declined year-over-year, mainly due to increased working capital. Sony Ericsson continued to show improved results and ST-Ericsson's transition program is on track.
Net income improved year-over-year and sequentially to 2 billion SEK, positively impacted by improved earnings in Sony Ericsson.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company acquired Nortel’s code division multiple access (CDMA) and long-term evolution (LTE) operations in North America. In February 2010, the Company acquired the remaining interest in LHS AG. In April 2010, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson acquired Nortel Networks' North American global system for mobile communications (GSM) business. In June 2010, Nortel Networks Ltd. sold its 50% interest in LG-Nortel Co. Ltd., the Company's Korean joint venture with LG Electronics Inc., to Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.

 Trends and Forces
 The economic slowdown has harmed the entire telecom industry
Due to the economic slowdown, the market for GSM/WCDMA network equipment and related services is estimated to have declined by more than 10%.[3] Ericsson’s sales for comparable units were down 9%, adjusted for currency and hedging effects.[3] A decline in Networks in line with the market was partly offset by an increase in Professional Services, driven by strong growth in managed services.[3] Reported Multimedia sales increased by 5% for comparable units.[3]

 4G technology provides a growth opportunity for Ericsson
Ericsson is the only supplier selected to participate in all major 4G/LTE projects.[3] Ericsson provides managed services to network operators which together serve 370 million subscribers. North America is set to become Ericsson’s largest and fastest growing market as major telecom operators adopt 4G technology. Ericsson's presence in North America has been elevated as its Chief Technology Officer has been relocated to Silicon Valley.

 Competition
Ericsson competes with Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Huawei, Nokia (NOK)/Siemens, Cisco Systems (CSCO), ZTE, Juniper Networks (JNPR), Accenture (ACN), HP/EDS, International Business Machines (IBM), Tata Consultancy Services (BOM:532540), Tech Mahindra (BOM:532755), Acision, Amdocs (DOX), Comverse Technology Inc (CMVT), Harmonic (HLIT), Oracle (ORCL), Thomson (EPA:TMS), Nokia (NOK), Motorola (MOT), Samsung Electronics (SEO:005930), LG, Nec Electronics (BER:NEN), Sharp Corporation (SHCAY), Apple (AAPL), High Tech Computer (TPE:2498) (HTC), Research in Motion (RIMM), Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT).
