Microsoft Releases eBook for IT Professionals to Learn Windows Server 2012




            With Windows Server 2012, Microsoft introduces a collection of new features  
to address the evolving business and technical needs of modern IT  
infrastructures. Core to this experience is the need to scale out,  
virtualize, and move workloads, applications, and services to cloud  
architectures. These cloud architectures, in turn, must  offer new levels of  
agility, efficiency and availability to provide an appreciable ROI back to  
the business organization. Windows Server 2012 incorporates Microsoft's  
experience with designing, managing and operating public clouds, all based on  
Windows Server, that have provided organizations with scalable, dynamic, and  
multi-tenant-aware platforms for securely connecting users and resources  
across global datacenters. Clouds, whether deployed publicly or privately,  
rely on the same technology components for applications, services,  
manag... (more)      



Microsoft Announces "Early Experts" Challenge on Windows Server 2012

The new Microsoft certification exams for MCSA on Windows Server 2012 will be  
released over the upcoming weeks and to help you prepare early for  
certification on Windows Server 2012, we're launching a new "Early Experts"  
peer study group that is available online for FREE.  By joining and  
participating in this study group, you'll gain access to a monthly set of  
structured step-by-step study materials that align with the exam objectives  
for each of the new certification exams for Windows Server 2012.  Each  
month, we'll be targeting a specific exam and a specific set of exam

Getting Started with Hyper-V Server 2012

With all the news this week around the launch of Windows Server 2012, you may  
have missed that Hyper-V Server 2012 has also launched! I've provided details  
on this equally important launch milestone along with helpful resources to  
get started below ...

What is Hyper-V Server 2012?
Hyper-V Server 2012 is a FREE (yes, completely free!) purpose-built product  
that includes the core of Windows Server 2012 and Hyper-V. The result is a  
streamlined Type-1 hypervisor that provides the same virtualization  
scalability and high availability features as the Hyper-V role in the full  
version o... (more)


Accelerating the Cloud with Windows Server 2012 BranchCache

Traditional file sharing protocols, such as Server Message Block ( SMB ) in  
Windows Server 2012, are primarily designed for low-latency, high-bandwidth  
scenarios commonly found in Local Area Networks ( LANs ).  When attempting  
to move file server workloads to the cloud, many IT Pros find that the  
unpredictable latency and limited bandwidth related to most Internet  
connections can make it challenging to deliver file services from the cloud  
in a reliable manner.

Lab Scenario
In this article, I’ll step through a configuration that leverages the  
BranchCache feature available in Wind... (more)


Scale-up Virtualization with Windows Server 2012 Release Candidate

Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 R2 supported configuring virtual machines with  
a maximum of four virtual processors and up to 64 GB of memory. However, many  
IT organizations increasingly want to use virtualization when they deploy  
mission-critical, tier-1 business applications into their private cloud  
datacenter fabric. Large, demanding workloads such as online transaction  
processing (OLTP) databases and online transaction analysis (OLTA) solutions  
typically run on systems with 16 or more processors and can demand large  
amounts of memory. For this class of workloads, more virtual ... (more)
