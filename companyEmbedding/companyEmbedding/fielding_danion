 Educational Background



 


The University of Manchester

                  The University of Manchester (UoM) is a large research university situated in the city of Manchester, England. Manchester University - as it is commonly known - is a public university formed in 2004 by the merger of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (est. 1824) and the Victoria University of Manchester (est. 1851). Manchester is a member of the worldwide Universities Research Association group, the Russell Group of British research universities and the N8 Group. The University of Manchester is regarded as a "red brick university", and was a product of the civic university movement of the late 19th century. It formed a constituent part of the federal Victoria University between 1880, when it received its royal charter, and 1903-1904, when it was dissolved.

The main campus is south of Manchester city centre on Oxford Road. In 2012, the university had around 39,000 students and 10,400 staff, making it the largest single-site university in the United Kingdom.[5] The University of Manchester had an income of £827 million in 2012–13, of which £200 million was from research grants and contracts.[6]

In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise,[7] Manchester came third in terms of research power and eighth for grade point average quality when including specialist institutions.[8] More students try to gain entry to the University of Manchester than to any other university in the country, with more than 60,000 applications for undergraduate courses.[9] According to the 2012 Highfliers Report, Manchester is the most targeted university by the Top 100 Graduate Employers.[10][11] In the 2012 Academic Ranking of World Universities, Manchester is ranked 40th in the world and 5th in the UK.[12] It is ranked 58th in the world and 12th in Europe in the 2014 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[13]

The university owns and operates major cultural assets such as the Manchester Museum, Whitworth Art Gallery, John Rylands Library and Jodrell Bank Observatory.

The University of Manchester has 25 Nobel Laureates among its past and present students and staff, the third-highest number of any single university in the United Kingdom after Cambridge and Oxford. Four Nobel laureates are currently among its staff – more than any other British university.                




 


University College London

                  University College London (UCL) is a public research university in London, England, and the oldest and largest constituent college of the federal University of London. Founded in 1826 as London University, UCL was the first university institution established in London and the first in England to be entirely secular, to admit students regardless of their religion, and to admit women on equal terms with men. The philosopher Jeremy Bentham is commonly regarded as the spiritual father of UCL, as his radical ideas on education and society were the inspiration to its founders, although his direct involvement in its foundation was limited. UCL became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London in 1836. It has grown through mergers, including with the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999) and the School of Pharmacy (in 2012). UCL's main campus is located in the Bloomsbury area of central London, with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals located elsewhere in central London, and satellite campuses in Adelaide, Australia and Doha, Qatar. UCL is organised into 10 constituent faculties, within which there are over 100 departments, institutes and research centres. UCL has around 26,700 students and 11,025 staff and had a total income of £937 million in 2012/13, of which £335 million was from research grants and contracts. UCL has around 4,000 academic and research staff and 650 full professors, the highest number of any British university. UCL is responsible for several museums and collections in a wide range of fields across the arts and sciences, including the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, a leading collection of Egyptian and Sudanese archaeology.                




 


The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - Kenan-Flagler Business School

                  Established in 1919 as the Department of Commerce of UNC Chapel Hill's College of Arts, the School was renamed the Kenan-Flagler Business School in 1991 to honor two prominent American business families and benefactors of the School: philanthropist Mary Lily Kenan Flagler and her husband, Henry Morrison Flagler. The renaming was in recognition of a generous gift from Frank Hawkins Kenan, another Kenan family member and benefactor of the School's Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise.
