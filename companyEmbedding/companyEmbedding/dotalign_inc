Unlocking Relationship Insights and Productivity




deep, smart analysis of email and crm data



connects the dots to help win new business



private and secure, yet collaborative






We're Hiring





            DotAlign is a Manhattan-based startup that provides software
            which delivers productivity and relationship insights. Our
            software automatically extracts intelligence from structured
            and unstructured data sources like email, calendar, contacts,
            LinkedIn, and CRM and answers questions such as which colleague
            can best provide a given introduction, which important contacts
            and companies you’re falling out of touch with, who hasn’t
            replied to your email request, and more.
        






THE PLATFORM




                    At the heart of DotAlign is a unique platform to provide Collaborative
                    Relationship Intelligence inside secure corporate environments.
                

                    The platform performs a deep analysis of content and provides advanced
                    entity management capabilities. It surfaces relationship intelligence about
                    people and companies and provides collaboration behind the firewall, by
                    allowing each user to define their own sharing circles and further define
                    what they share with each of those sharing circles.
                






Network Graph


                    The platform maintains a network graph of all person and
                    company relationships, so at any point the question of
                    who knows who can be answered quickly and easily.
                




Strength of Relationships


                    For any person or company, a strength of relationship score is
                    computed based on many different data points. This score is dynamic
                    and representative of how much influence a person has with another
                    person or company
                






Entity Management


                    DotAlign automatically resolves people and company data from across
                    multiple sources. This inherent capability also means new data sources
                    can be plugged in easily.
                




NLP and Text Analysis


                    Smart, NLP-based analysis of email and other content, bringing insights to
                    prospecting and inbox workflows. This includes detecting when an email needs
                    your attention, signature block parsing to keep your contacts up to date and
                    more.
                





APPLICATIONS




                    Built on top of the DotAlign platform, are apps that bring the power of
                    relationship intelligence into common user workflows, whether it is
                    super charging your inbox, making your prospecting workflows efficient
                    and rewarding, or providing you critical information on the go.

                    deployment of the DotAlign Platform inside the enterprise firewall.
                    There are many modules that comprise DotAlign Server, and each plugs-in 
                    to enable a set of scenarios. 
                






In-House Data Aggregation


                    Using this module, an enterprise will be able to automatically gather
                    firm-wide relationship data that is generated by users of DotAlign applications
                    (subject to the privacy settings of individual users) to create reports,
                    generate statistics and administer it for quality.
                




Exchange/Office 365 Integration


                    This module provides the ability to analyze email by directly interfacing
                    with Exchange Server and/or Office 365. Using this approach, data can be
                    analyzed centrally and made available for consumption by users and 
                    administrators.
                






Third Party Data Integration


                    A critical part of DotAlign Server is the ability to bring in 3rd
                    party data sources. Sources like Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics
                    are on our roadmap, and the framework also allows integration with
                    other data sources that may already be in use inside the enterprise.
                




Network Alliances


                    This module puts the enterprise at the center of a network of relationships and
                    allows its advisors, portfolio companies and other partner enterprises to collaborate
                    with each other. As a part of this solution, the enterprise defines the rules and
                    participants involved in the collaboration, while each participant retains the
                    ability to share what makes sense from their perspective. This essentially extends the
                    paradigm of “human sensibilities” across company boundaries.
                






REST API


                    DotAlign Server also provides a REST API over the people and
                    company data it collects. This can be used by enterprises to
                    bring relationship intelligence into other enterprise apps.

OUR APPROACH

The Real World is Complicated

            Relationship data is being generated everywhere, whenever people interact with each other.
            It is a treasure trove of actionable information, but is also sensitive and subject to many
            business rules and human sensibilities. That, among a few other fundamental reasons, is why we
            think that existing solutions fail to unlock the inherent value in email, CRM, LinkedIn, and
            other types of relationship data.
        

            Impediments to tapping the power of relationship data, a.k.a where many existing solutions fail, include:
        


Data is in silos
Lack of integration into workflows
Lack of intelligent text analysis
Not addressing human sensibilities
Oversimplifying the real world of People, Companies and Relationships
Privacy concerns


DotAlign Addresses the Complexities

            DotAlign is different and has been built from the ground up to address these finer points of human
            interaction. Also, we bring into our solution a data model that is sufficiently sophisticated to
            model the messy and complex world of People, Companies and Relationships. Finally, our approach is
            architecturally secure and designed to work without having to move data from where it already lives
            to some other scarier place. This alleviates many privacy concerns of individual users and compliance
            officers out of the box, and makes it easy to adopt DotAlign.

            NYC Tech Summit.

Unlocking Relationship Insights and Productivity




deep, smart analysis of email and crm data



connects the dots to help win new business



private and secure, yet collaborative






We're Hiring





            DotAlign is a Manhattan-based startup that provides software
            which delivers productivity and relationship insights. Our
            software automatically extracts intelligence from structured
            and unstructured data sources like email, calendar, contacts,
            LinkedIn, and CRM and answers questions such as which colleague
            can best provide a given introduction, which important contacts
            and companies you’re falling out of touch with, who hasn’t
            replied to your email request, and more.
        






THE PLATFORM




                    At the heart of DotAlign is a unique platform to provide Collaborative
                    Relationship Intelligence inside secure corporate environments.
                

                    The platform performs a deep analysis of content and provides advanced
                    entity management capabilities. It surfaces relationship intelligence about
                    people and companies and provides collaboration behind the firewall, by
                    allowing each user to define their own sharing circles and further define
                    what they share with each of those sharing circles.
                






Network Graph


                    The platform maintains a network graph of all person and
                    company relationships, so at any point the question of
                    who knows who can be answered quickly and easily.
                




Strength of Relationships


                    For any person or company, a strength of relationship score is
                    computed based on many different data points. This score is dynamic
                    and representative of how much influence a person has with another
                    person or company
                






Entity Management


                    DotAlign automatically resolves people and company data from across
                    multiple sources. This inherent capability also means new data sources
                    can be plugged in easily.
                




NLP and Text Analysis


                    Smart, NLP-based analysis of email and other content, bringing insights to
                    prospecting and inbox workflows. This includes detecting when an email needs
                    your attention, signature block parsing to keep your contacts up to date and
                    more.
                





APPLICATIONS




                    Built on top of the DotAlign platform, are apps that bring the power of
                    relationship intelligence into common user workflows, whether it is
                    super charging your inbox, making your prospecting workflows efficient
