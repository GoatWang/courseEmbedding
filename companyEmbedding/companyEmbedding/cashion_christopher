Chris Wagner

Meet Chris Wagner.  Chris is a native resident of Kannapolis, NC and is as passionate about his family and beliefs as he is about fishing! There he resides with his beautiful wife Leslie, first born son Hyatt, and baby girl Maggie! As a National Pro-Staff member he really enjoys the business side of promoting the company and sharing the passion he has for the product! Educating anglers about Cashion Rods whether it be at a retail store, show, or tournament is important to him. Competing with Cashion Rods has taking his game to a whole new level, and was an important tool that allowed him to win the Carolinas Bass Challenge NC Division Championship in September 2013!
“I have had the pleasure of fishing Cashion Rods since the beginning of the company, and I have over 25 years experience fishing the best products in the industry. I can truly say that this is the best rod I have ever put in my hands. The scientific approach Cashion is known for will make a difference in your fishing, whether your a serious tournament angler or just enjoy a weekend at the lake!”

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

	Item
	8.01 Regulation FD Disclosure






	 





	On
	June 1, 2017, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (the “Company”)
	approved August 15, 2017 as the date for the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2016
	(the “Meeting”). The Board also approved June 19, 2017 as the record date for the Meeting. Only stockholders of record
	at the close of business on that date may vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.




	 




	Because
	the Meeting will be held more than 30 days from the anniversary of the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the
	year ended December 31, 2015 (the “Prior Meeting”), the Company has set a deadline for the receipt of any stockholder
	proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
	for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials for the Meeting. Such proposals must be delivered to Chris Cashion, the Company’s
	Chief Financial Officer, at Superior Drilling Products, Inc., 1583 South 1700 East, Vernal, Utah 84078 no later than the close
	of business on June 26, 2017 to be considered timely, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Bylaws, before the Company
	begins to print and send proxy materials. The Company recommends that such proposals be sent by certified mail, return receipt
	requested. Such proposals must also comply with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the inclusion of
	stockholder proposals in proxy materials, and may be omitted by the Company if not in compliance with applicable requirements.




	 




	In
	addition, because the Meeting will be held more than 30 days from the anniversary of the Prior Meeting, in accordance with the
	Company’s Bylaws, proposals of stockholders made outside of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must be received not later
	than the close of business on June 26, 2017 in order to be considered at the Meeting. Such proposals must be delivered to Chris
	Cashion, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, at Superior Drilling Products, Inc., 1583 South 1700 East, Vernal, Utah
	84078, and must also comply with all other requirements set forth in the Company’s Bylaws and other applicable laws.
