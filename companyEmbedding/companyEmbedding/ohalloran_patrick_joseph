Patrick Joseph O'halloran's Experience
Title: Board Member
               Company: Naples Council on World Affairs
Job Details
               The Naples Council is the fifth largest council in the system and is an all-volunteer organization catering to more than 2200 members whose interests in Foreign Affairs are pronounced. In 2008, it was chosen by the World Affairs Councils of America as the best all-volunteer Council. We are proud to partner with other national organizations, to conduct people-to-people diplomacy, to organize Model United Nations Programs, and to build new community relationships. We offer an annual lecture series as well as additional speaker programs that bring a group of very distinguished scholars and statesmen before our membership. Many of our speakers agree to share their knowledge further by also speaking to groups of Collier County high school students as part of our School Outreach program. Our Flagship Programs offer wonderful opportunities to our members, our schools and our community. The Great Decisions Program, celebrating 52 years as a grassroots foreign policy education initiative, is run by the Foreign Policy Association in New York City. The FPA produces an annual briefing book, encompassing eight current event topics, that is used as a guide in discussion groups that reach over 500,000 people nationwide. In our Council, 430 members participated in 2008 in discussion groups of 25 to 30. We also sponsor the Academic WorldQuest, designed to expand the worldview of students nationwide. No other program better illustrates the interconnectivity of understanding, growing, and engaging than AWQ, our national high school competition in world affairs. We have sent four high school teams to Washington to date to compete with teams from all over the country. The World in Transition, a multi-media educational series, is produced by the Atlanta World Affairs Council/Southern Center for International Studies. Updated constantly, as our world grows more complex each year, the series covers the globe with essays, maps, graphs, statistics and other factual data. The program is used by nearly 40,000 teachers and 1.5 million students annually. The Naples Council has made this program available to Collier County teachers, over 20 of whom have been trained in its use. The Model United Nations is one of our longest standing and most successful programs, involving students from Collier and Lee County high schools in two days of mock UN proceedings, for which the students prepare for much of the year. In 2008 there were 14 schools and 250 students participating. The Council is also proud of its Village Assistance Program (VAP). It was initiated a few years ago to provide modest financial assistance to needy areas in foreign countries. Thus far the Council has provided funds through the VAP for thatch-roofed concrete structures in two Indian villages in the mountains of Mexico to give the village ladies a common workplace in which to do their traditional embroidery; for basic medical equipment for a volunteer HIV/AIDS clinic in Jamaica; and for the construction of an impressive adult literacy center in a village in Ghana. In each of these efforts a member of the Council played a key role in organizing and overseeing the project.

Background[edit]
O'Halloran was the youngest son of Sylvester O'Halloran, born in county Limerick, Ireland. On 22 February 1781 he was appointed midshipman on board the East India Company's sloop of war Swallow, and in July that year obtained an infantry cadetship; was made ensign in the Bengal army on 9 May 1782 and lieutenant on 6 January 1785. In 1790 he married, and on 7 January 1796 became captain.[1]
Indian Service[edit]
From June 1796 to October 1802 he was adjutant and quartermaster at Midnapúr, and was attached to the public works department. On the abolition of his office he rejoined his corps, the late 18th Bengal native infantry. In September 1803 he accompanied a force of all arms which crossed the Jumna for the subjugation of Bundelkund, and on 12 October defeated fifteen thousand Marathas at Kopsah. His gallantry at the sieges of Bursaar and Jeswarree in January 1804 led to his appointment to supervise the operation irregular force of two thousand men, under Shaik Kurub Ali, in the interior of Bundelkund. On 15 May he attacked and defeated, after a determined resistance, Raja Rām and ten thousand Bondeelas entrenched among the rocks and hills of Màhābā. On 1 July he commanded two brigades of irregulars in another attack on Raja Rām and a force of sixteen thousand Bondeelas and Naghas on the fortified hills of Thanah and Purswarree. Subsequently, he served at the siege of Saitpur, and in December attacked and stormed several other towns and forts. In January 1805 he captured the forts of Niagacre and Dowra, in Pinwarree, His services were noticed by the Marquis Wellesley. On 1 November 1805 he was appointed commissary of supplies by Lord Lake, and, on the breaking up of the army on 1 June 1806, rejoined his regiment, and on 25 April 1808 attained the rank of major. He commanded the attack on the strongly fortified hill of Rogoulee, in Bundelkund, on 22 January 1809.[1]
Colonel Gabriel Martindell, who commanded in Bundelkund, made O'Halloran his military secretary; and his conduct at the head of the first battalion 18th native infantry at the siege of the fortress of Adjeghur was specially noticed. He became lieutenant-colonel on 4 June 1814, served in the campaigns against the Nepaulese in 1815 and 1816, in the first campaign covering the district of Tirhoot, in the second at the siege of Hurreehurpur, and afterwards commanded his battalion in Cuttack during the disturbances there. For his services he was made C.B. In August 1818 he was sent to join the first battalion 20th native infantry in the Straits Settlements, and on arrival there was appointed commandant of the 25th Bengal native infantry. In January 1825 he was appointed brigadier at Barrackpore. Before leaving he received the thanks of the government of the Straits Settlements for his zeal and marked ability, and received the unusual honour of a salute of eleven guns on his embarkation. In December 1828 he became a brigadier-general, and was appointed to the Saugor division of the army. He became colonel of a regiment on 4 June 1829. With the expiration of his five years' period of staff service, on 23 December 1833, ended his active military career of fifty-three years, during which he had never taken any furlough or leave to Europe.[1]
Knighthood[edit]
O'Halloran landed in England in May 1834. In February 1835 he received knighthood at the hands of William IV, who observed that the distinction was well earned by his long meritorious and gallant services, and by his consecration of his eight sons to the service of his country, O'Halloran came a major-general on 10 Jan. 1837. He was made K.C.B. in 1837, and G.C.B. in 1841. He became a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of London in 1836, was chosen an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1838, and received the freedom of his native city (Limerick) on 25 February the same year. He died at his residence in Connaught Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 3 November 1843, from the effects of a street accident, causing fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone. He was buried in the catacombs at Kensal Green cemetery, immediately beneath the chapel. A memorial tablet was placed in the wall of the south cloister.[1]
O'Halloran married, in 1790, Frances, daughter of Colonel Nicholas Bayley, M.P., of Redhill, Surrey, late of the 1st foot-guards and brother of the first Earl of Uxbridge, by whom he had a large family. His sons included Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran and William Littlejohn O'Halloran.[1]

In December 1828 he became a brigadier-general, and was appointed to the Saugor division of the army. He became colonel of a regiment on 4 June 1829. With the expiration of his five years' period of staff service, on 23 December 1833, ended his active military career of fifty-three years, during which he had never taken any furlough or leave to Europe.[1]
Knighthood[edit]
O'Halloran landed in England in May 1834. In February 1835 he received knighthood at the hands of William IV, who observed that the distinction was well earned by his long meritorious and gallant services, and by his consecration of his eight sons to the service of his country, O'Halloran came a major-general on 10 Jan. 1837. He was made K.C.B. in 1837, and G.C.B. in 1841. He became a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of London in 1836, was chosen an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1838, and received the freedom of his native city (Limerick) on 25 February the same year. He died at his residence in Connaught Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 3 November 1843, from the effects of a street accident, causing fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone. He was buried in the catacombs at Kensal Green cemetery, immediately beneath the chapel. A memorial tablet was placed in the wall of the south cloister.[1]
O'Halloran married, in 1790, Frances, daughter of Colonel Nicholas Bayley, M.P., of Redhill, Surrey, late of the 1st foot-guards and brother of the first Earl of Uxbridge, by whom he had a large family. His sons included Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran and William Littlejohn O'Halloran.[1]

Background[edit]
O'Halloran was the youngest son of Sylvester O'Halloran, born in county Limerick, Ireland. On 22 February 1781 he was appointed midshipman on board the East India Company's sloop of war Swallow, and in July that year obtained an infantry cadetship; was made ensign in the Bengal army on 9 May 1782 and lieutenant on 6 January 1785. In 1790 he married, and on 7 January 1796 became captain.[1]
Indian Service[edit]
From June 1796 to October 1802 he was adjutant and quartermaster at Midnapúr, and was attached to the public works department. On the abolition of his office he rejoined his corps, the late 18th Bengal native infantry. In September 1803 he accompanied a force of all arms which crossed the Jumna for the subjugation of Bundelkund, and on 12 October defeated fifteen thousand Marathas at Kopsah. His gallantry at the sieges of Bursaar and Jeswarree in January 1804 led to his appointment to supervise the operation irregular force of two thousand men, under Shaik Kurub Ali, in the interior of Bundelkund. On 15 May he attacked and defeated, after a determined resistance, Raja Rām and ten thousand Bondeelas entrenched among the rocks and hills of Màhābā. On 1 July he commanded two brigades of irregulars in another attack on Raja Rām and a force of sixteen thousand Bondeelas and Naghas on the fortified hills of Thanah and Purswarree. Subsequently, he served at the siege of Saitpur, and in December attacked and stormed several other towns and forts. In January 1805 he captured the forts of Niagacre and Dowra, in Pinwarree, His services were noticed by the Marquis Wellesley. On 1 November 1805 he was appointed commissary of supplies by Lord Lake, and, on the breaking up of the army on 1 June 1806, rejoined his regiment, and on 25 April 1808 attained the rank of major. He commanded the attack on the strongly fortified hill of Rogoulee, in Bundelkund, on 22 January 1809.[1]
Colonel Gabriel Martindell, who commanded in Bundelkund, made O'Halloran his military secretary; and his conduct at the head of the first battalion 18th native infantry at the siege of the fortress of Adjeghur was specially noticed. He became lieutenant-colonel on 4 June 1814, served in the campaigns against the Nepaulese in 1815 and 1816, in the first campaign covering the district of Tirhoot, in the second at the siege of Hurreehurpur, and afterwards commanded his battalion in Cuttack during the disturbances there. For his services he was made C.B. In August 1818 he was sent to join the first battalion 20th native infantry in the Straits Settlements, and on arrival there was appointed commandant of the 25th Bengal native infantry. In January 1825 he was appointed brigadier at Barrackpore. Before leaving he received the thanks of the government of the Straits Settlements for his zeal and marked ability, and received the unusual honour of a salute of eleven guns on his embarkation. In December 1828 he became a brigadier-general, and was appointed to the Saugor division of the army. He became colonel of a regiment on 4 June 1829. With the expiration of his five years' period of staff service, on 23 December 1833, ended his active military career of fifty-three years, during which he had never taken any furlough or leave to Europe.[1]
