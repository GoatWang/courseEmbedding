							Manufacturer Narrative
						
					



					
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Note: the manufacturer completed all of the information on this form.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									It was reported to trimedyne as part of a product liability lawsuit that the above referenced procedure was performed using a trimedyne laser and trimedyne laser side firing needle and/or fiber devices.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									However, no malfunction of the laser or delivery devices was reported to trimedyne by the end user, and no devices were returned to trimedyne for evaluation.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									The lot number of the trimedyne side fire tip used in the procedure was not provided to trimedyne.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Based on the information available to date, the only potential lot numbers of the side fire tip used in this procedure were obtained based on the purchasing history of the user facility and the timeframe preceding the event.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									These potential lot numbers and corresponding expiration dates / dates of manufacture are listed below: lot 706007.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Exp.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Date: 03/31/2011.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Date of manufacture: 10/01/2007.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Lot 806002.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Exp.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Date: 03/31/2012.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Date of manufacture: 08/20/2008.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									There is no available evidence at this time that trimedyne's devices caused or contributed to this event.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									The manufacturer's instructions for use state, "aim the laser only at tissues intended for treatment; otherwise, damage to surrounding tissues may result.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									" three mdrs have been filed for this single event: one for the trimedyne laser (reference 1419951-2012-00001), one for the trimedyne handpiece/fiber assembly (reference 1419951-2012-00002), and one for the side fire tip (this mdr, 1419951-2012-00003).
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									(b)(4).
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Device not returned to manufacturer.
									
							
									
					
				

 

					
						
							Manufacturer Narrative
						
					



					
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Based on a summary of the deposition of the surgeon who performed the procedure, sent to trimedyne by an attorney, it was reported that the doctor had no criticism of the trimedyne device and that it performed as intended in the plaintiff's surgery.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Neither the plaintiff's deposition (b)(4) nor the deposition of the surgeon who performed the procedure indicate that trimedyne's devices caused or contributed to this event.
									
							
									
					
				

 

					Event Description
					



					
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									It was reported that after a "laser surgery upon the lumbar spine" using a trimedyne "holmium yag laser device" and trimedyne "laser side firing needle and/or fiber devices," the patient's "spinal nerve roots [allegedly] became thermally damaged or burned.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									" the patient is alleged to be "in constant pain.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									" "the pain radiates from the right knee cap up the front of her thigh to the pelvic area and her right hip/side.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									She has no pain along the spine.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									She describes the pain as numbing, throbbing, burning, and sharp.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									She has hypersensitivity on her right thigh from the kneecap up.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									She claims that her right thigh is numb all of the time like 'novocain' and changes in color and temperature.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									" the procedure is reported to have occurred using a trimedyne laser and trimedyne laser side firing needle and/or fiber devices.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									No information has been provided to date regarding any specific product failure related to the above referenced devices.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Following the initial surgery, the patient underwent two additional surgeries and a nerve block.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									"earlier this year [2012], she noticed that the pain in her groin area had gotten worse.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									It felt like she had to urinate constantly and she experienced extreme pain during intercourse.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									".

              Information 








     The
                Holmium:YAG (Ho:YAG) laser is perhaps the most versatile
                surgical laser available to today's laser surgeon. The unique
                ability of the Ho:YAG to vaporize, ablate and coagulate soft
                tissues and extremely hard materials, such as calculi, have made
                it the laser of choice for orthopedic, urologic, ENT,
                gynecologic, gastroenterologic and general surgeons worldwide.
    
                A relatively low depth of thermal penetration, excellent
                hemostasis, delivery systems that allow access to even the
                tightest spaces, and a wide variety of tissue effects are just a
                few of the many benefits the Ho:YAG laser can bring to your
                patients and your practice.
    
                Holmium:YAG laser energy, at 2100 nm (2.1 microns), is rapidly>
                absorbed by the water in tissue and has an ultimate depth of
                penetration of 0.4 mm or less. Holmium laser energy can ablate
                hard materials such as calcified urinary tract calculi while
                also being able to treat the delicate structures encountered in
                spinal, gynecological and ENT surgery.
                   
                Trimedyne's OmniPulse MAX incorporates several
                state-of-the-art technologies available only on Trimedyne laser
                systems.
   
                 DoublePulse™,
                a patented waveform, allows the treatment of hard materials
                using one half the energy of the traditional single pulse
                waveform with similar results . These lower energy
                settings greatly decrease the chance for residual heat build up
                in tiny areas like the ureter or tight interdiscal spaces. Only
                the OmniPulse MAX offers both traditional single pulse and
                the DoublePulse waveforms in the same laser.
    
                All Trimedyne Holmium:YAG lasers have an on-board power meter.
                The power meter allows verification of the integrity of all of
                our delivery systems to ensure accurate delivery of the selected
                energy. The on-board power meter can also extend the useful life
                of our reusable devices by allowing operating room staff to test
                the functionality of the optical fiber before, during or after
                use. The read-out on the laser's control panel will readily
                verify that the optical fiber is still delivering adequate
                energy and is suitable to be sterilized for another procedure.
    Our
                unique cooling system can generate 100% duty cycles for our
                Holmium:YAG lasers systems at most settings. Duty cycle refers
                to the ability of a device to operate at or near full power. A
                100% duty cycle means that the OmniPulse MAX can deliver the
                full, programmed power to tissue throughout the procedure with
                less likelihood that the laser will overheat.  Many
                competitive lasers have duty cycles as low as 30%, which can
                result in the laser shutting down during the middle of a
                procedure.  Additionally, the heat exchanger systems
                employed by competitive lasers release a considerable amount of
                heat into the surgical suite and, when coupled with the internal
                fans required to keep these competitive devices cool, may
                produce more noise than the Trimedyne OmniPulse MAX.
     Trimedyne's
                patented fiber connection provides better protection for the
                delivery system fiber and laser optics.  Its design
                eliminates the possibility of the laser beam striking a metallic
                surface with the resultant rapid degradation of optical
                surface's and reduction of energy to tissue.  The standard
                SMA 905 connectors utilized by other Holmium laser manufacturers
                do not provide this capability.
    
                "Versatile,
                efficient, quiet and extremely reliable," are the words
                most often used to explain why the Trimedyne OmniPulse MAX is
                the Holmium:YAG laser of choice for informed surgeons .

        Spine Therapy
        Provider List



 

 
        


  Company
              Profile  








    
                As the average age of the population rises, healthcare needs are
                expected to increase exponentially.   Technological
                advances in surgical procedures and advances in drug and gene
                therapy continue to promote the trend to replace invasive
                surgical procedures with less invasive, more cost-effective
                alternatives.  The era of managed healthcare provides
                additional pressure to reduce medical costs.  Trimedyne
                continues to invest heavily in the development of new,
                minimally-invasive, cost-effective surgical procedures.

The
                Company is actively developing new products to deal with
                age-related illnesses and medical conditions that impact the
                lives of millions.  We are working on products for the
                treatment of menorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding), female
                stress incontinence, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH or
                enlarged prostate), GERD (or esophagus reflux disorder), and
                recurrent ear infections.
In
                2000, we acquired Mobile Surgical Technologies, Inc. (MST),
                which rents lasers and provides trained operators on a "fee
                per case" basis to hospitals and surgery centers in the
                Southwest.  In 2001 we entered into a Letter of Intent to
                acquire a similar "fee per case" rental company in the
                Southeast, and we plan to expand into the West, Northeast and
                Midwest through joint ventures or acquiring others.
In
                addition to developing new products, we are focusing on
                increasing the number of procedures  being performed with
                our present devices.  As we develop
                new procedures, we will facilitate physician access to Trimedyne
                products and services by renting lasers, along with a trained
                operator, on a "fee per case" basis.  This gives
                physicians and their hospitals an opportunity to see the results
                of the new procedure, the reimbursement and the patient volume,
                before buying or leasing the laser.
We
                are optimistic about the future of Trimedyne. We believe that
                the procedures we develop improve the quality of life while
                reducing medical costs.  We are committed to seeing that
                effort translate into increased revenues and expanding market
                share.

Four Easy Steps to Market Your Practice OnlineThanks to advancing technology, marketing a medical practice online doesn't have to be costly and confusing. In fact, it can be distilled down into four basic steps that anyone can take. These are: (1) Creating a viable, enhanced practice website, (2) utilizing techniques to be found by patients online, (3) engaging in social media and mobile health apps, and (4) monitoring your online reputation. We'll discuss these in this whitepaper as well as the best practices for each.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

	With Its New, Patented Side Firing Laser Fiber, Trimedyne Brings Exciting 
	News To Men Suffering From An Enlarged Prostate Or A Herniated Ruptured Disc 
	In The Spine




Company 
	Profile: 


	Trimedyne develops, manufactures and markets medical lasers and patented 
	disposable and reusable fiber optic devices for use in minimally invasive 
	procedures as alternatives to surgery. Trimedynes laser procedures, most of 
	which are performed on an outpatient basis, have higher success rates 
	than surgery and avoid most of the adverse effects and complications of 
	surgery.

 


	Trimedynes new VaporMAXŽ Side Firing Laser Fiber was recently cleared for 
	sale by the FDA for use with Trimedynes and other Holmium lasers for the 
	treatment of enlarged prostates, a condition which affects about 50% of men 
	over age 55, typically on an outpatient basis. A similar device will 
	be marketed by Lumenis, Ltd. through Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) 
	in the U.S. and Japan and by Lumenis through its large sales organization 
	elsewhere throughout the world, when Lumenis and BSX complete their audit of 
	Trimedynes manufacturing process and quality system, which is expected to 
	take several months.  Lumenis is a medical laser manufacturer based in 
	Israel with sales of about $300 million. 

 


	However, Trimedyne has begun production and will begin marketing its new 
	VaporMAXŽ Fiber through its own sales organization in March, 
	2010.

 


	Trimedynes Holmium lasers and fiber optic devices are also used in 
	orthopedics for the treatment of herniated or ruptured discs in the spine 
	and the treatment of damage in joints, typically on an outpatient 
	basis, and in urology for fragmenting stones in the kidney and bladder, and 
	for a variety of other uses, which requires a hospital stay of a day or 
	longer.

 


	Trimedyne also rents lasers with a trained operator to hospitals and surgery 
	centers in the southwest for a per case fee.


Marvin 
	P. Loeb, Sc.D.
Chairman and CEO of Trimedyne, Inc. and Cardiomedics, Inc.

Marvin Loeb is an experienced entrepreneur 
	in the health care field. Over a period of thirty years, he founded 27 
	companies, of which he took 15 public by IPO (most of which have been sold 
	to or merged with larger companies), 6 of the privately held companies were 
	sold to larger companies without going through an IPO, four failed and two 
	are still privately held. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science 
	degree and has been issued 60 U.S. Patents, with an additional 10 patent 
	applications pending.

The Interview conducted 
	by Walter Banks Publisher: CEOCFOinterviews.com, Published  February 5, 
	2010


CEOCFO:
With us today is Dr. Marvin P. Loeb, the 
	founder and Chairman of Trimedyne, Inc., a manufacturer of medical lasers 
	and fiber-optic reusable and disposable devices. Trimedynes symbol is 
	TMED.OB.
 

CEOCFO: Dr. 
	Loeb, tell us about the new product you are developing.

Dr. Loeb: 
	Trimedyne has recently developed a new, patented, VaporMAXŽ Side Firing 
	Laser Fiber for use with our 80 watt Holmium Lasers and other high-power 
	Holmium Lasers for the treatment of enlarged prostates in men, technically 
	called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH. Developing this new product 
	has caused us to run at a loss for the last two years, but the development 
	program has now been completed. 

 

Our new VaporMAXŽ Fiber has been 
	cleared for sale in the U.S. by the FDA, and we expect it will be approved 
	for sale in the European Union in a few weeks. We had excellent reports from 
	physicians evaluating this new Fiber, we are commencing production and 
	expect to begin selling this new Fiber in March of this year. We expect 
	sales of these Fibers will begin to contribute to our revenues in the first 
	calendar quarter of 2010, and we expect to return to profitability in the 
	next quarter or two.
 

Our business is growing. In the Fiscal Year 
	ended September 30, 2009, we had revenues of $7,422,000, a 26.4% increase 
	over revenues of $5,871,000 in the prior Fiscal Year. In the current Fiscal 
	Year, we had a net loss of $909,000 or 5 cents per share on a weighted 
	average of 18,365,960 shares outstanding, a 42.8% reduction from our net 
	loss of $1,590,000 or 9 cents per share in the prior Fiscal Year.

 

In the quarter ended September 30, 2009, 
	revenues were $2,112,000, an 18.6% increase from revenues of $1,781,000 for 
	the same quarter of the prior year.

 

Also, in the Quarter ended September 30, 2009, 
	our net loss was only $37,000 or zero per share on a weighted average of 
	18,366,000 shares outstanding, a reduction of 90% from the net loss of 
	$366,000 or 2 cents per share in the year ago quarter on the same number of 
	shares. As you can see we are almost at breakeven.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Tell us about your business and products and their uses, and how they fit in 
	the market place.

Dr. Loeb: 
	Our business is divided into three segments of about equal size. In 
	orthopedics, our Holmium Lasers and Side Firing Laser Needles are used to 
	treat herniated or ruptured discs in the spine (lumbar, thoracic or 
	cervical), typically in 30 to 40 minute outpatient procedures, with 
	published success rates of 85 to 94%. The patient walks out about an hour 
	after the procedure with a Band Aid on the needle puncture, and can usually 
	return to light activities in a couple of days and to work in about a week.  
	About 600,000 people are treated for a herniated or ruptured disc each year 
	in the United States.

 

In conventional disc surgery, called Fusion 
	Surgery, the disc is removed, the space between the vertebra is filled with 
	cadaver bone to fuse the vertebra together, over time, and the vertebra are 
	rigidly attached to one-another with screws and plates. The published 
	success rates for Fusion Surgery are only 40 to 77%, compared to our 
	published success rates of 85 to 94%.

 

Also, in conventional disc surgery, the patient 
	is hospitalized for 2 to 5 days, suffers substantial bleeding and pain, has 
	several weeks of recuperation, usually has to endure up to six months of 
	rehabilitation and exercise therapy and can be out of work for up to two 
	months or longer.

 

Our lasers are also used with specially 
	designed fiber-optic devices to treat damage in joints, such as the knee, 
	shoulder, elbow, hip, wrist or ankle, typically on an outpatient 
	basis, a procedure called Arthroscopy. About 1.2 million Arthroscopy 
	procedures are performed each year in the United States. 

 

Another segment of our business is in Urology, 
	in which our Holmium Lasers and FlexMAXŽ optical fibers are used 
	to fragment stones in the kidney, ureter or bladder. Our lasers have been 
	shown in a published study to fragment stones faster and into smaller pieces 
	than other lasers, making them easier to pass during urination.

 

Treating BPH with our Holmium lasers and our 
	new VaporMAXŽ Side Firing Fiber is a new business for us. About 
	1.2 million procedures are performed each year throughout the world to treat 
	BPH, about 200,000 of which are in the U.S.  Urologists earn about 35% of 
	their income from treating BPH, so this is a large, important new market.

 

The third segment of our business is renting 
	lasers to hospitals and surgery centers with a trained operator on a per 
	case basis to do orthopedic, urology and other procedures. Lasers are 
	expensive and operating them takes training.

 

Many hospitals dont want to invest $120,000 or 
	more in a laser and have one of their people trained, who might leave, 
	requiring them to send another person for training. Calling our 800 number 
	and having the laser delivered, with our highly trained technician to 
	operate it, makes this very convenient for hospitals and outpatient surgery 
	centers.

 

Also, hospitals and surgery centers and their 
	doctors want the newest equipment, and they dont want to be stuck with an 
	expensive laser, if a new laser or other device arises that does a procedure 
	faster or better, so renting lasers on a per case business is 
	cost-effective.

 

All three of these segments of our business are 
	growing, as you can see in our year-over-year sales growth. We expect they 
	will continue to grow, as our laser procedures entail less bleeding and 
	fewer infections, usually avoid hospitalization and enjoy shorter 
	recuperation times, allowing people to return to work earlier, which is 
	important in this economy. And, our laser procedures cost less than 
	conventional surgery.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Would you tell us about the size of these markets and how you are 
	positioned?

Dr. Loeb: 
	An estimated 15 million people in the U.S. suffer from a herniated, ruptured 
	or degenerated disc. About 600,000 surgical procedures to treat herniated or 
	ruptured discs are performed each year in the United States at an average 
	cost of about $34,000 each, a total cost of almost $20 billion per year. 
	This is a market our patented lasers and side firing needles address. Our 
	laser procedures cost insurance companies about $14,000, a savings of about 
	$20,000 per case, compared to the cost of surgery. If the patient has to pay 
	a 20% co-pay, 20% of $14,000 is a lot less than 20% of $34,000.

 

Presently, our lasers are used in only about 1 
	or 2 percent of these procedures, so we have a lot of room to grow in 
	this business.

 

With President Obama pushing for a national 
	healthcare plan, and with greater attention to technologies that save money, 
	we expect this segment of our business will continue to grow.  

 

In urology, millions of people take drugs to 
	treat an enlarged prostate. When the drugs no longer control the prostates 
	growth, each year about 1.2 million people throughout the world, about 
	200,000 in the United States, have their enlarged prostate treated in either 
	a procedure using radiofrequency or RF energy, or laser energy.

 

The RF procedure takes an hour or more, 
	requires a 2 to 3 day hospital stay and entails significant bleeding. Up to 
	10% of the patients lose more than a pint of blood and require a blood 
	transfusion. Nobody wants a blood transfusion, because there may be a 
	variety of dangerous viruses and organisms in donor blood, which is usually 
	tested only for AIDS and hepatitis.

 

The RF procedure also entails a substantial 
	infection rate, a week or two of recuperation, up to 10% of the men who were 
	potent before the procedure become impotent, and up to 15% become 
	permanently incontinent.

 

Our laser procedure to treat an enlarged 
	prostate usually takes 30 to 45 minutes, is typically performed on an 
	outpatient basis, with little or no bleeding or pain, and the patient 
	can usually return to light activities in a couple of days. On the plus 
	side, Medicare pays more for the laser procedure than the RF procedure, 
	which makes this attractive to hospitals and surgery centers.

 

Over the past six or seven years, the use of 
	lasers to treat enlarged prostates has grown from very little to about $150 
	million per year. We hope to gain a sizeable share of this market, both in 
	our Urology business and in our per case laser rental business.

 

Lithotripsy, or the fragmentation of stones in 
	the kidney, ureter or bladder, is also growing, as Holmium lasers have 
	proven superior to other technologies for this application. Most large 
	hospitals in the U.S. already use lasers for fragmenting stones. Now smaller 
	hospitals in the U.S. and large and small hospitals overseas are buying 
	Holmium Lasers for use in Lithotripsy.

 

Presently our per case laser rental business 
	covers Texas and adjoining areas. We plan to expand this business into other 
	metropolitan markets in the future, using our Holmium Lasers and patented 
	VaporMAXŽ Side Firing Fiber for the treatment of enlarged 
	prostates, and our patented Side Firing Laser Needles to treat ruptured and 
	herniated discs in the spine, as a springboard to enter new markets.

 

CEOCFO: You 
	were in litigation with Lumenis, Ltd. and ended up with a partner; would you 
	explain how that happened?

Dr. Loeb: A 
	few years ago, we sued Lumenis for infringement of our patents on side 
	firing laser fibers and for certain anti-trust violations. Lumenis is the 
	worlds largest manufacturer of medical lasers, with sales of about $300 
	million worldwide, and has a large, established sales organization.

 

We settled this litigation, and Lumenis agreed 
	to purchase 100% of its requirements for Side Firing Laser Fibers, which 
	emit laser energy, at 75ş to 90ş, and 75% of their requirements for Angled 
	Firing Fibers, which emit energy at less than 75ş, from Trimedyne. However, 
	before we can start shipping Lumenis a side firing fiber similar to our 
	VaporMAXŽ Side Firing Fiber, which emits laser energy at about 
	85ş, Lumenis must audit our manufacturing process and our quality system, to 
	be sure our products meet their quality requirements, which will take 
	several months.

 

Lumenis presently markets their DuoTome Angled 
	Firing Fiber for the treatment of enlarged prostates through Boston 
	Scientific Corporation in the U.S. and Japan, and through Lumenis large 
	sales organization elsewhere throughout the world. This settlement means 
	that, indirectly, we will have the benefit of Boston Scientifics large 
	presence in urology in the U.S. and Japan in marketing the Side Firing 
	Fibers we will be selling to Lumenis.

 

Boston Scientifics audit of our manufacturing 
	process and quality system covers essentially the same items Lumenis will be 
	auditing.  While Boston Scientific is expected to accept Lumenis audit 
	results, they may audit some items more extensively, so Boston Scientifics 
	audit could add a month or two to the total audit period.  

 

While this audit process will take time, when 
	it is completed, we will be picking up Lumenis existing volume from selling 
	its angled firing fibers to Boston Scientific and through Lumenis own sales 
	organization, so we will not be starting from scratch.

 

In the meantime, Lumenis is paying us a royalty 
	of 7.5% on their sales of such Fibers.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Tell us about you competition and what sets you apart?

Dr. Loeb: 
	Laserscope pioneered the use of lasers and side firing laser fibers for 
	treating enlarged prostates, and they are presently the leader in this 
	market. In 2006, Laserscope sold about $100 million of lasers and side 
	firing fibers to treat enlarged prostates. In late 2006, Laserscope was 
	acquired by American Medical Systems (whose NASDAQ symbol is AMMD). The 
	price was $715 million or $26 per share, up from about $2 per share in 
	2001.  AMMD is our principal competitor.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Going back to you new VaporMAXŽ Fiber, what countries are the 
	best markets for it?

Dr. Loeb: 
	At about $750 each, these Laser Fibers are expensive and are discarded after 
	one use. Only in the U.S., Japan, the European Union and a few other 
	countries is reimbursement sufficient to enable hospitals to pay about $750 
	for a disposable Laser Fiber.  

 

Outside these countries, the patient often has 
	to pay extra for the laser procedure to treat his enlarged prostate, which 
	limits the market to middle and upper income men. Since the RF procedure to 
	treat an enlarged prostate entails hospitalization, significant pain, the 
	risk of severe bleeding, sometimes requiring a blood transfusion, and the 
	risks of impotence and incontinence, if they can afford it, men have a good 
	reason to pay extra for the laser procedure.

 

There are of course, affluent people in many 
	other countries, such as the Middle East, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, 
	Russia, Australia, China, Korea and India. We expect these countries, along 
	with the U.S., Japan and the European Union will be significant markets for 
	our new VaporMAXŽ Fiber.

 

CEOCFO: 
	When can we expect to see significant sales from your new Fiber?

Dr. Loeb: 
	Lumenis has been marketing its angled-firing laser fiber for a number of 
	years. It is not as fast at vaporizing tissue, and it is not as durable as 
	our new Fiber. While we believe it will be several months until the audits 
	by Lumenis and Boston Scientific are completed and Lumenis begins buying our 
	new Side Firing Fiber, we will be marketing our VaporMAXŽ Fiber through our 
	own sales organization, which is much smaller than Lumenis and Boston 
	Scientifics.

 

When Lumenis begins purchasing a copy of our 
	VaporMAXŽ Fiber from us, which they will market under their new DuraMAX 
	trademark, we expect to see a sizeable increase in our revenues. 

 

Of course, we will be selling the new Side 
	Firing Fiber to Lumenis on an OEM basis at a substantial discount. So, even 
	though our marketing organization is small, we will earn a higher percentage 
	of the sales price selling Fibers through our own people. A modest increase 
	in our revenues from sales by our people, due to the larger profit margin, 
	will have a disproportionate effect on our bottom line.

 

CEOCFO: 
	What is the long-term outlook for Trimedyne?

Dr. Loeb: 
	If President Obama is successful in implementing a national health insurance 
	plan, which will expand health coverage to an additional 30 or 40 million 
	Americans, the market for our products will grow substantially. If this new 
	healthcare program gives preference to devices which have higher success 
	rates and lowers hospital costs, I believe Trimedyne could see tremendous 
	growth ahead.

 

We plan to use some of the profits we expect 
	from sales of our new Side Firing Fiber to conduct more training courses for 
	surgeons to expand our spinal disc market, increase the size of our sales 
	organization and expand our per case laser rental business into other 
	markets in the United States. 

 

CEOCFO: 
	Would you tell us about your management team, board of directors and how you 
	work together?

Dr. Loeb: I 
	founded the company in 1980, based on some of my patents. Ive been issued 
	about 60 patents for use in the treatment of a variety of medical 
	conditions, of which about 20 were assigned to Trimedyne without 
	compensation.

 

Glenn D. Yeik, our president and COO, is a 
	superb engineer and has been with us for 14 years. He designed our Holmium 
	Laser and new Side Firing Fiber, and he has developed a unique manufacturing 
	process for our new Side Firing Fiber to insure its durability and fast 
	vaporization rate.

 

Brian T. Kenney, our VP of sales and marketing, 
	has been with Trimedyne for 9 years. He is responsible for appointing and 
	training our sales reps and distributors, and he is adept at teaching our 
	laser procedures.

 

Jeffrey S. Rudner, our chief accounting 
	officer, has been with us 8 years and very ably manages our accounting, 
	receivables, billing and customer service departments. 

 

CEOCFO: 
	What is the financial position of Trimedyne today?

Dr. Loeb: 
	At September 30, 2009, we had about $1.6 million in cash and equivalents and 
	current assets of about $5.1 million, versus payables and accrued expenses 
	of only about $946,000. We have no bank debt and no long-term debt.

 

CEOCFO: How 
	many patents does Trimedyne currently have?

Dr. Loeb: 
	Trimedyne has 22 patents and four pending patent applications. We are 
	developing a new type of laser, which may result in a new patent, and we 
	have patents covering other new laser fibers which are in an early stage of 
	development. 

 

CEOCFO: 
	With so many public companies to choose from in the healthcare arena, why 
	should potential investors consider Trimedyne?
Dr. Loeb: Very few medical device 
	companies have a growing business and a new FDA cleared device, enabling it 
	to enter a new market with a large potential. With Lumenis as a marketing 
	partner, and their distribution capabilities through Boston Scientific, as 
	well as through their own sales organization, we believe we are on the verge 
	of substantial growth.


CEOCFO: Do you focus on reaching the 
	investment community and if so what are you doing?
Dr. Loeb: You may remember several years 
	ago, when CEOCFO first covered Trimedyne, we were earning $1 million a year 
	and we had just gotten into the lawsuit with Lumenis, the outcome looked 
	promising and it was a good time. Then the market hit us in 2008 and 2009, 
	which was a problem for everybody. However, our sales have grown in 2008 and 
	2009 regardless of the markets decline. 

 

Im from the old school. Now that we are at 
	breakeven and, hopefully, in the next quarter or two, we will be in the 
	black. Ill toot our horn more aggressively when our profits grow, rather 
	than talking about things we hope to achieve.
 

CEOCFO: You 
	mentioned some forward-looking statements in this interview, what would you 
	like to say in closing?

Dr. Loeb: 
	To satisfy our SEC attorney, I must tell you this interview contains 
	forward-looking statements, as defined by the Securities Reform Act of 1995, 
	which include estimates, beliefs, plans and expectations, the accuracy of 
	which cannot be assured, and actual results may differ substantially from 
	those described herein.
 

I hope investors interested in Trimedyne will 
	go to our website, www.trimedyne.com, for copies of our press releases, 
	product information, financial statements and SEC filings, to learn more 
	about our growing business. 

 

CEOCFO: Dr. 
	Loeb, thank you for sharing Trimedynes story with us.

Dr. 
	Loeb: Thank you 
	for inviting me to do so.
