Description
It's fair to say that we wouldn't have songs like Kindhearted Woman Blues, Traveling Riverside Blues, Preaching Blues or Hellhound On My Trail without Blue Day Blues (Scrapper Blackwell), Roll and Tumble Blues (Hambone Willie Newburn), Preaching the Blues (Son House) or Devil Got my Woman (Skip James). And in Roots of Robert Johnson Tom Feldmann takes you verse-by-verse through those songs, and many others, that played such an integral role in Robert Johnson's own recordings.
Covering a wide range of styles, techniques, keys, and tunings, this lesson will expand your range as a player and take you on the musical journal that created one of history's most lauded blues guitarists.
A detailed tab/music booklet is included as a PDF file on the DVD. In addition the original recordings of all the tunes are included.
Titles include: Standard Tuning: Lead Pencil Blues (Johnnie Temple), Blue Day Blues (Scrapper Blackwell), Life Saver Blues (Lonnie Johnson) Open G Tuning: Police Station Blues (Peetie Wheestraw), My Black Mama (Son House), Roll and Tumble Blues (Hambone Willie Newburn) Open D Tuning: Preaching the Blues (Son House) Crossnote Tuning: Devil Got my Woman (Skip James)
114 minutes • Level 2/3 • Detailed tab/music PDF file on the DVD
Review: Among his legion of disciples are bona fide guitar heroes – bluesmen like Muddy and Elmore, rockers such as Eric and Keith. But who were his heroes, the idol's idols? And which of their songs were irresistible to his formative ear? In other words, what are the roots of the root: The Roots of Robert Johnson? Fresh from having just taught The Guitar of Robert Johnson through a three-DVD set, Tom Feldmann now loops back to teach eight of the catalysts which helped instigate Johnson's repertoire. A most interesting roomful of characters gathers in the process, from hardened Delta bottleneckers (Son House) to urban string dazzlers (Scrapper Blackwell) to the High Sheriff of Hell himself (Peetie Wheatstraw). Lonnie Johnson – who, along with Eddie Lang and Charlie Christian, invented single-note soloing – floats 1927's Life Saver Blues. Johnnie Temple's bummed-out Lead Pencil Blues is inversely earthen in its ramrod shuffle. Since misery loves misery, Skip James goes the extra mile to seal the doom of Devil Got My Woman inside the gloom of Crossnote tuning: perfectly spooky fodder for Johnson's eventual hellhounds. Guided by Feldmann's technical expertise, this cool game of Spot the Inspiration keeps racking up everything from Terraplanes and judgment days to those shards of Walking Blues flickering within My Black Mama. Besides all the step-by-step how-to, all the original historic sides reside as bonus material. So you can hear why 1929's Roll and Tumble Blues became as ubiquitous as oxygen throughout Mississippi before you learn how to play its quintessential killer slide lick. – Dennis Rozanski/Blues Rag

Liberal Pundit: Fox News’s On-Air Product Consistent With Its Off-Air Misogyny and Racism

By Tom Johnson | April 29, 2017 11:14 AM EDT 



Just as it’s exceedingly tricky to know the dancer from the dance, it’s awfully hard to separate Fox News Channel’s program content from its hypermacho, litigation-generating workplace. That was the word from Talking Points Memo editor and publisher Josh Marshall in a Friday post.
In Marshall’s words, FNC on the air and FNC in the office are “almost umbilically tied…If you’ve watched Fox for years and you found that it wasn’t a hotbed of sexual harassment, pervasive racist attitudes and a generalized sixty-something faux-bro ‘alpha’ culture, you’d have to think you had been scammed, that the big screen talent were somehow hypocrites and frauds. It would be like finding out that Chris Hayes was a major libertarian who funded the Cato Institute and Club for Growth or that Joy Reid had secretly been advising Donald Trump throughout the 2016 election cycle.”
Marshall stated that “obviously there are harassers of all political persuasions” and that he wasn’t “saying conservatives are harassers or racists. Far from it.” Nonetheless, he maintained, “The simple facts [are] that lots of Fox’s programming has for years amounted to pro- ass-slapping your colleagues at work propaganda…That toxic [office] culture is inextricably tied to the product itself: a worldview of resentment and provocation, contempt for changing cultural mores about sex, gender, race and a slew of other things.”      
The big issue now, Marshall indicated, is the long-term impact of this turmoil on FNC’s viewership and, ultimately, its bottom line (bolding added):










<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>DONATE

The charge, frisson and much of the gravitational pull of Fox News has been about a certain kind of cultural politics -- resistance to changing cultural mores and how they affect the channel’s core demographic: older white men.
It’s worth considering whether News Corp can clean house at Fox without losing the cultural punch of the product and thus at least to some significant degree losing its hold on the audience itself.
