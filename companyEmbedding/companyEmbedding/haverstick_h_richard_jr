The directors of a company tend to have a unique inside view into the business, so when directors make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason a director of a company would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by company directors over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $119.9K by H. Richard Haverstick Jr., Director at Brandywine Realty Trust (Symbol: BDN).   Purchased Insider Title Shares Price/Share Value   02/08/2017 H. Richard Haverstick Jr. Director 7,500 $15.98 $119,868.00      Haverstick Jr.'s average cost works out to $15.98/share. Shares of Brandywine Realty Trust were changing hands at $16.27 at last check, trading up about 1% on Thursday. The chart below shows the one year performance of BDN shares, versus its 200 day moving average:       Looking at the chart above, BDN's low point in its 52 week range is $11.22 per share, with $17.05 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $16.27.    The current annualized dividend paid by Brandywine Realty Trust is $0.64/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 01/09/2017. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for BDN, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 4.0% annualized yield is likely to continue.       BDN makes up 1.18% of the PowerShares Active U.S. Real Estate Fund ETF (Symbol: PSR)   Click here to find out which other top insider   buys by company directors you need to know about »
