Alterra Power Corp. is a diversified renewable power generation company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was formed in 2011 through the merger of Magma Energy Corp. and Plutonic Power Corp. It develops geothermal, hydroelectric, wind, and solar energy projects. The company is listed under AXY on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and has a secondary listing OTC in the United States under MGMXF:US.[3]

Merger[edit]
On 7 March 2011, it was announced that Magma Energy and Plutonic Power would merge to create Alterra Power Corp.[4] Magma Energy was renamed Alterra Power and each shareholder of Plutonic Power received 2.38 shares of Magma for each Plutonic share held. As a result, the merged company owns two geothermal power plants in Iceland, and one in Nevada, one run of river hydro plant and one wind farm in British Columbia and an option on a solar project in Ontario. Executive Chairman of Alterra Power is Ross Beaty (founder of Magma Energy) and the CEO is John Carson.[5]

Expansion projects[edit]
Run of river expansions[edit]
Its proposed 40 run of river hydroelectric development projects have a design capacity of nearly 2,000 MW with the potential to generate approximately 5000 GWh per annum of green energy - enough energy to meet the annual energy needs of over 500,000 homes.
Included in the 40 projects is the creation of the Green Power Corridor, a series of non-storage hydroelectric projects in southwestern BC, which hold the potential to bring British Columbia to the forefront of green energy generation in North America. The completion of the corridor would create approximately 4,000 person-years of employment.
Partnership has started construction on the Toba River energy development located 100 km North of Powell River, British Columbia, Canada. Construction services for the 196 MW run of river project is overseen by Peter Kiewit Inc. a subsidiary of the Kiewit Corporation and will produce 745 GWh/a of electricity and at an approximate cost of $660,000,000.[6] Once complete it will be the largest private funded renewable energy project in British Columbia history.[citation needed]
Toba Montrose Hydro[edit]
East Toba River(123MW) and Montrose Creek(73MW) are two run-of-river hydroelectic plants 18km apart, they have operated since in 2010 with a combined capacity of 196 MW and generate an average of 720 GWh of electricity annually, which is contracted to B.C. Hydro.
Upper Toba Valley[edit]
The Upper Toba Valley Hydroelectric project[7] originally planned two renewable power facilities constructed 90km north of Powell River, BC at the headwaters of Toba Inlet the first is on Jimmie Creek which flows west into Toba River and the second on the Upper Toba River. Installed capacity of the two facilities was to be 124 MW with an expected annual energy generation of 316 GW hr/yr. Alterra received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the Upper Toba facility.[7] In 2013 Alterra also received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the 62MW Jimmie Creek facility.[8] In 2016 Alterra Power Corp. announced that the Jimmie Creek facility had achieved its full output of 62 MW.[9] It is located at 50°34′08″N 124°04′21″W﻿ / ﻿50.568962°N 124.072627°W﻿ / 50.568962; -124.072627
Bute Inlet[edit]
The Bute Inlet Hydroelectric project[10] consists of 17 facilities at the headwaters of Bute Inlet, located about 150–200 km (93–124 mi) north of Powell River, British Columbia. Combined, these facilities have a potential capacity of 1027 MW with potential energy generation of 2905 GWh per year.
This project was not awarded an energy contract from BC Hydro, and therefore is currently not proceeding.
Solar power expansions[edit]
In early 2011, Plutonic Power agreed, together with GE Energy financial Services, to purchase three proposed photovoltaic power plants in Ontario from First Solar. The three plants will have a total capacity of 50 MW, divided between Amherstburg (10MW), Belmont (20MW) and Walpole (20MW). This represents a first venture into solar power for Plutonic Power although engineering, procurement, construction and operation will still be provided by First Solar.[11]
Orka's controversy[edit]
In 2010, during the Icelandic financial crisis, Magma Energy acquired 98.5% of shares in the Icelandic geothermal power company HS Orka.[12] The deal created an opposition in Iceland. On May 21, 2010 Icelandic singer Björk wrote an open letter in the newspaper Reykjavík Grapevine, calling on the Icelandic government to "do everything in its power to revoke the contracts with Magma Energy".[13] The deal was approved by the Icelandic Government.[14] Recently Alterra as operator has 67%, while the Icelandic pension funds helds 33%.[15]

The Bute Inlet Hydroelectric project[10] consists of 17 facilities at the headwaters of Bute Inlet, located about 150–200 km (93–124 mi) north of Powell River, British Columbia. Combined, these facilities have a potential capacity of 1027 MW with potential energy generation of 2905 GWh per year.
This project was not awarded an energy contract from BC Hydro, and therefore is currently not proceeding.
Solar power expansions[edit]
In early 2011, Plutonic Power agreed, together with GE Energy financial Services, to purchase three proposed photovoltaic power plants in Ontario from First Solar. The three plants will have a total capacity of 50 MW, divided between Amherstburg (10MW), Belmont (20MW) and Walpole (20MW). This represents a first venture into solar power for Plutonic Power although engineering, procurement, construction and operation will still be provided by First Solar.[11]
Orka's controversy[edit]
In 2010, during the Icelandic financial crisis, Magma Energy acquired 98.5% of shares in the Icelandic geothermal power company HS Orka.[12] The deal created an opposition in Iceland. On May 21, 2010 Icelandic singer Björk wrote an open letter in the newspaper Reykjavík Grapevine, calling on the Icelandic government to "do everything in its power to revoke the contracts with Magma Energy".[13] The deal was approved by the Icelandic Government.[14] Recently Alterra as operator has 67%, while the Icelandic pension funds helds 33%.[15]

Expansion projects[edit]
Run of river expansions[edit]
Its proposed 40 run of river hydroelectric development projects have a design capacity of nearly 2,000 MW with the potential to generate approximately 5000 GWh per annum of green energy - enough energy to meet the annual energy needs of over 500,000 homes.
Included in the 40 projects is the creation of the Green Power Corridor, a series of non-storage hydroelectric projects in southwestern BC, which hold the potential to bring British Columbia to the forefront of green energy generation in North America. The completion of the corridor would create approximately 4,000 person-years of employment.
Partnership has started construction on the Toba River energy development located 100 km North of Powell River, British Columbia, Canada. Construction services for the 196 MW run of river project is overseen by Peter Kiewit Inc. a subsidiary of the Kiewit Corporation and will produce 745 GWh/a of electricity and at an approximate cost of $660,000,000.[6] Once complete it will be the largest private funded renewable energy project in British Columbia history.[citation needed]
Toba Montrose Hydro[edit]
East Toba River(123MW) and Montrose Creek(73MW) are two run-of-river hydroelectic plants 18km apart, they have operated since in 2010 with a combined capacity of 196 MW and generate an average of 720 GWh of electricity annually, which is contracted to B.C. Hydro.
Upper Toba Valley[edit]
The Upper Toba Valley Hydroelectric project[7] originally planned two renewable power facilities constructed 90km north of Powell River, BC at the headwaters of Toba Inlet the first is on Jimmie Creek which flows west into Toba River and the second on the Upper Toba River. Installed capacity of the two facilities was to be 124 MW with an expected annual energy generation of 316 GW hr/yr. Alterra received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the Upper Toba facility.[7] In 2013 Alterra also received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the 62MW Jimmie Creek facility.[8] In 2016 Alterra Power Corp. announced that the Jimmie Creek facility had achieved its full output of 62 MW.[9] It is located at 50°34′08″N 124°04′21″W﻿ / ﻿50.568962°N 124.072627°W﻿ / 50.568962; -124.072627
Bute Inlet[edit]

Merger[edit]
On 7 March 2011, it was announced that Magma Energy and Plutonic Power would merge to create Alterra Power Corp.[4] Magma Energy was renamed Alterra Power and each shareholder of Plutonic Power received 2.38 shares of Magma for each Plutonic share held. As a result, the merged company owns two geothermal power plants in Iceland, and one in Nevada, one run of river hydro plant and one wind farm in British Columbia and an option on a solar project in Ontario. Executive Chairman of Alterra Power is Ross Beaty (founder of Magma Energy) and the CEO is John Carson.[5]

Expansion projects[edit]
Run of river expansions[edit]
Its proposed 40 run of river hydroelectric development projects have a design capacity of nearly 2,000 MW with the potential to generate approximately 5000 GWh per annum of green energy - enough energy to meet the annual energy needs of over 500,000 homes.
Included in the 40 projects is the creation of the Green Power Corridor, a series of non-storage hydroelectric projects in southwestern BC, which hold the potential to bring British Columbia to the forefront of green energy generation in North America. The completion of the corridor would create approximately 4,000 person-years of employment.
Partnership has started construction on the Toba River energy development located 100 km North of Powell River, British Columbia, Canada. Construction services for the 196 MW run of river project is overseen by Peter Kiewit Inc. a subsidiary of the Kiewit Corporation and will produce 745 GWh/a of electricity and at an approximate cost of $660,000,000.[6] Once complete it will be the largest private funded renewable energy project in British Columbia history.[citation needed]
Toba Montrose Hydro[edit]
East Toba River(123MW) and Montrose Creek(73MW) are two run-of-river hydroelectic plants 18km apart, they have operated since in 2010 with a combined capacity of 196 MW and generate an average of 720 GWh of electricity annually, which is contracted to B.C. Hydro.
Upper Toba Valley[edit]
The Upper Toba Valley Hydroelectric project[7] originally planned two renewable power facilities constructed 90km north of Powell River, BC at the headwaters of Toba Inlet the first is on Jimmie Creek which flows west into Toba River and the second on the Upper Toba River. Installed capacity of the two facilities was to be 124 MW with an expected annual energy generation of 316 GW hr/yr. Alterra received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the Upper Toba facility.[7] In 2013 Alterra also received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the 62MW Jimmie Creek facility.[8] In 2016 Alterra Power Corp. announced that the Jimmie Creek facility had achieved its full output of 62 MW.[9] It is located at 50°34′08″N 124°04′21″W﻿ / ﻿50.568962°N 124.072627°W﻿ / 50.568962; -124.072627
Bute Inlet[edit]
The Bute Inlet Hydroelectric project[10] consists of 17 facilities at the headwaters of Bute Inlet, located about 150–200 km (93–124 mi) north of Powell River, British Columbia. Combined, these facilities have a potential capacity of 1027 MW with potential energy generation of 2905 GWh per year.
This project was not awarded an energy contract from BC Hydro, and therefore is currently not proceeding.
Solar power expansions[edit]
In early 2011, Plutonic Power agreed, together with GE Energy financial Services, to purchase three proposed photovoltaic power plants in Ontario from First Solar. The three plants will have a total capacity of 50 MW, divided between Amherstburg (10MW), Belmont (20MW) and Walpole (20MW). This represents a first venture into solar power for Plutonic Power although engineering, procurement, construction and operation will still be provided by First Solar.[11]
Orka's controversy[edit]
In 2010, during the Icelandic financial crisis, Magma Energy acquired 98.5% of shares in the Icelandic geothermal power company HS Orka.[12] The deal created an opposition in Iceland. On May 21, 2010 Icelandic singer Björk wrote an open letter in the newspaper Reykjavík Grapevine, calling on the Icelandic government to "do everything in its power to revoke the contracts with Magma Energy".[13] The deal was approved by the Icelandic Government.[14] Recently Alterra as operator has 67%, while the Icelandic pension funds helds 33%.[15]

VANCOUVER, July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Alterra Power Corp. ("Alterra") is pleased to announce the completion of financing for the 200 MW Flat Top wind project and the concurrent advancement of the project into the final phase of construction. Key components of the financing include:









Sponsor-Partner Investment: A fund managed by BlackRock Real Assets has acquired a 49% sponsor-partner interest in the project, and will co-own the project with Alterra. Alterra will continue to own 51% of the sponsor equity. 
$287 Million Construction Loan Facility: Affiliates of Citi, Santander and the Royal Bank of Canada supplied the facility, consisting of a $217 million loan plus letters of credit totaling $71 million (all amounts USD). The facility is secured by project assets and supported by a tax equity investor commitment. 
$221 Million Commitment from Tax Equity Partners: Subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Citi have committed to a $221 million investment which will be realized when the project achieves commercial operations, subject to typical conditions precedent. The tax equity investment will retire the construction loan facility. 
$21 Million Expansion of Holding Company Loan: Alterra has satisfied the final conditions precedent to funding of its expanded loan facility with affiliates of AMP Capital Investors Limited. The proceeds ($21.1 million, gross) funded a portion of Alterra's sponsor equity contribution for the project. 

"We're extremely pleased to have our Shannon financing partners join us again at Flat Top, and to welcome a strong, new partner in BlackRock," said John Carson, Alterra's CEO. "We anticipate that the Flat Top project will serve our stakeholders and the State of Texas well, delivering a large amount of clean power into a lesser served portion of the state for years to come."
The 200 MW Flat Top project, located in central Texas is contracted to sell the majority of its power under a 13-year power hedge with an affiliate of Citi. Blattner Energy, Inc. is already mobilized on site and will provide services for the primary construction phase, while an affiliate of Vestas-American Wind Technology, Inc. is supplying the project's wind turbines. The project is expected to achieve commercial operations in the first half of 2018. Alterra originally acquired the Flat Top wind project from Pioneer Green Energy, LLC and Lavaca Wind, LLC, each of whom have extensive experience in the development of several wind projects that are currently operating.
About Alterra Power Corp. 
Alterra Power Corp. is a global renewable energy company that manages eight power plants totaling 825 MW of hydro, wind, geothermal and solar generation capacity in Canada, the USA and Iceland. Alterra owns a 363 MW share of this capacity, generating over 1,500 GWh of clean power annually. 
Alterra is also constructing the 200 MW Flat Top wind project in central Texas, which is expected to be in operation by 1H 2018 (51% owned by Alterra). Upon the completion of Flat Top, Alterra will operate nine power plants totaling 1,025 MW of capacity and will own a 465 MW share of this capacity, generating almost 2,000 GWh of clean power annually.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information
Certain statements and information included in this news release are "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking information relates to future events or future performance and reflects management's expectations and beliefs regarding future events as of the date hereof. Examples of forward-looking information in this news release include the successful construction of, and achievement of commercial operations for, the Flat Top project, satisfaction of conditions precedent to the tax equity investment and Alterra's projected generation. Forward-looking information is based on factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection. Since forward-looking information relates to future events and conditions, by its very nature it requires making assumptions and involves inherent risks and uncertainties. Alterra cautions that although it is believed that the assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances, these risks and uncertainties give rise to the possibility that actual results may differ materially from the expectations set out in the forward-looking information. Material risk factors and assumptions include whether the actual power generation from our operations meets our expectations; the success and timely completion of construction efforts at the Flat Top project; achievement of commercial operations at the Flat Top project; Alterra's ability to successfully satisfy the conditions precedent to the tax equity investment; as well as others set out in the management's discussion and analysis section of Alterra's most recent annual and quarterly reports and in Alterra's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2016. Although Alterra has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that forward-looking information will prove to be accurate and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Except as required by law, Alterra undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking information to reflect new information, subsequently or otherwise.

Merger[edit]
On 7 March 2011, it was announced that Magma Energy and Plutonic Power would merge to create Alterra Power Corp.[4] Magma Energy was renamed Alterra Power and each shareholder of Plutonic Power received 2.38 shares of Magma for each Plutonic share held. As a result, the merged company owns two geothermal power plants in Iceland, and one in Nevada, one run of river hydro plant and one wind farm in British Columbia and an option on a solar project in Ontario. Executive Chairman of Alterra Power is Ross Beaty (founder of Magma Energy) and the CEO is John Carson.[5]

Expansion projects[edit]
Run of river expansions[edit]
Its proposed 40 run of river hydroelectric development projects have a design capacity of nearly 2,000 MW with the potential to generate approximately 5000 GWh per annum of green energy - enough energy to meet the annual energy needs of over 500,000 homes.
Included in the 40 projects is the creation of the Green Power Corridor, a series of non-storage hydroelectric projects in southwestern BC, which hold the potential to bring British Columbia to the forefront of green energy generation in North America. The completion of the corridor would create approximately 4,000 person-years of employment.
Partnership has started construction on the Toba River energy development located 100 km North of Powell River, British Columbia, Canada. Construction services for the 196 MW run of river project is overseen by Peter Kiewit Inc. a subsidiary of the Kiewit Corporation and will produce 745 GWh/a of electricity and at an approximate cost of $660,000,000.[6] Once complete it will be the largest private funded renewable energy project in British Columbia history.[citation needed]
Toba Montrose Hydro[edit]
East Toba River(123MW) and Montrose Creek(73MW) are two run-of-river hydroelectic plants 18km apart, they have operated since in 2010 with a combined capacity of 196 MW and generate an average of 720 GWh of electricity annually, which is contracted to B.C. Hydro.
Upper Toba Valley[edit]
The Upper Toba Valley Hydroelectric project[7] originally planned two renewable power facilities constructed 90km north of Powell River, BC at the headwaters of Toba Inlet the first is on Jimmie Creek which flows west into Toba River and the second on the Upper Toba River. Installed capacity of the two facilities was to be 124 MW with an expected annual energy generation of 316 GW hr/yr. Alterra received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the Upper Toba facility.[7] In 2013 Alterra also received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the 62MW Jimmie Creek facility.[8] In 2016 Alterra Power Corp. announced that the Jimmie Creek facility had achieved its full output of 62 MW.[9] It is located at 50°34′08″N 124°04′21″W﻿ / ﻿50.568962°N 124.072627°W﻿ / 50.568962; -124.072627
Bute Inlet[edit]
The Bute Inlet Hydroelectric project[10] consists of 17 facilities at the headwaters of Bute Inlet, located about 150–200 km (93–124 mi) north of Powell River, British Columbia. Combined, these facilities have a potential capacity of 1027 MW with potential energy generation of 2905 GWh per year.
This project was not awarded an energy contract from BC Hydro, and therefore is currently not proceeding.
Solar power expansions[edit]
In early 2011, Plutonic Power agreed, together with GE Energy financial Services, to purchase three proposed photovoltaic power plants in Ontario from First Solar. The three plants will have a total capacity of 50 MW, divided between Amherstburg (10MW), Belmont (20MW) and Walpole (20MW). This represents a first venture into solar power for Plutonic Power although engineering, procurement, construction and operation will still be provided by First Solar.[11]
Orka's controversy[edit]
In 2010, during the Icelandic financial crisis, Magma Energy acquired 98.5% of shares in the Icelandic geothermal power company HS Orka.[12] The deal created an opposition in Iceland. On May 21, 2010 Icelandic singer Björk wrote an open letter in the newspaper Reykjavík Grapevine, calling on the Icelandic government to "do everything in its power to revoke the contracts with Magma Energy".[13] The deal was approved by the Icelandic Government.[14] Recently Alterra as operator has 67%, while the Icelandic pension funds helds 33%.[15]

Merger[edit]
On 7 March 2011, it was announced that Magma Energy and Plutonic Power would merge to create Alterra Power Corp.[4] Magma Energy was renamed Alterra Power and each shareholder of Plutonic Power received 2.38 shares of Magma for each Plutonic share held. As a result, the merged company owns two geothermal power plants in Iceland, and one in Nevada, one run of river hydro plant and one wind farm in British Columbia and an option on a solar project in Ontario. Executive Chairman of Alterra Power is Ross Beaty (founder of Magma Energy) and the CEO is John Carson.[5]

Expansion projects[edit]
Run of river expansions[edit]
Its proposed 40 run of river hydroelectric development projects have a design capacity of nearly 2,000 MW with the potential to generate approximately 5000 GWh per annum of green energy - enough energy to meet the annual energy needs of over 500,000 homes.
Included in the 40 projects is the creation of the Green Power Corridor, a series of non-storage hydroelectric projects in southwestern BC, which hold the potential to bring British Columbia to the forefront of green energy generation in North America. The completion of the corridor would create approximately 4,000 person-years of employment.
Partnership has started construction on the Toba River energy development located 100 km North of Powell River, British Columbia, Canada. Construction services for the 196 MW run of river project is overseen by Peter Kiewit Inc. a subsidiary of the Kiewit Corporation and will produce 745 GWh/a of electricity and at an approximate cost of $660,000,000.[6] Once complete it will be the largest private funded renewable energy project in British Columbia history.[citation needed]
Toba Montrose Hydro[edit]
East Toba River(123MW) and Montrose Creek(73MW) are two run-of-river hydroelectic plants 18km apart, they have operated since in 2010 with a combined capacity of 196 MW and generate an average of 720 GWh of electricity annually, which is contracted to B.C. Hydro.
Upper Toba Valley[edit]
The Upper Toba Valley Hydroelectric project[7] originally planned two renewable power facilities constructed 90km north of Powell River, BC at the headwaters of Toba Inlet the first is on Jimmie Creek which flows west into Toba River and the second on the Upper Toba River. Installed capacity of the two facilities was to be 124 MW with an expected annual energy generation of 316 GW hr/yr. Alterra received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the Upper Toba facility.[7] In 2013 Alterra also received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the 62MW Jimmie Creek facility.[8] In 2016 Alterra Power Corp. announced that the Jimmie Creek facility had achieved its full output of 62 MW.[9] It is located at 50°34′08″N 124°04′21″W﻿ / ﻿50.568962°N 124.072627°W﻿ / 50.568962; -124.072627
Bute Inlet[edit]
The Bute Inlet Hydroelectric project[10] consists of 17 facilities at the headwaters of Bute Inlet, located about 150–200 km (93–124 mi) north of Powell River, British Columbia. Combined, these facilities have a potential capacity of 1027 MW with potential energy generation of 2905 GWh per year.
This project was not awarded an energy contract from BC Hydro, and therefore is currently not proceeding.

Merger[edit]
On 7 March 2011, it was announced that Magma Energy and Plutonic Power would merge to create Alterra Power Corp.[4] Magma Energy was renamed Alterra Power and each shareholder of Plutonic Power received 2.38 shares of Magma for each Plutonic share held. As a result, the merged company owns two geothermal power plants in Iceland, and one in Nevada, one run of river hydro plant and one wind farm in British Columbia and an option on a solar project in Ontario. Executive Chairman of Alterra Power is Ross Beaty (founder of Magma Energy) and the CEO is John Carson.[5]

Expansion projects[edit]
Run of river expansions[edit]
Its proposed 40 run of river hydroelectric development projects have a design capacity of nearly 2,000 MW with the potential to generate approximately 5000 GWh per annum of green energy - enough energy to meet the annual energy needs of over 500,000 homes.
Included in the 40 projects is the creation of the Green Power Corridor, a series of non-storage hydroelectric projects in southwestern BC, which hold the potential to bring British Columbia to the forefront of green energy generation in North America. The completion of the corridor would create approximately 4,000 person-years of employment.
Partnership has started construction on the Toba River energy development located 100 km North of Powell River, British Columbia, Canada. Construction services for the 196 MW run of river project is overseen by Peter Kiewit Inc. a subsidiary of the Kiewit Corporation and will produce 745 GWh/a of electricity and at an approximate cost of $660,000,000.[6] Once complete it will be the largest private funded renewable energy project in British Columbia history.[citation needed]
Toba Montrose Hydro[edit]
East Toba River(123MW) and Montrose Creek(73MW) are two run-of-river hydroelectic plants 18km apart, they have operated since in 2010 with a combined capacity of 196 MW and generate an average of 720 GWh of electricity annually, which is contracted to B.C. Hydro.
Upper Toba Valley[edit]
The Upper Toba Valley Hydroelectric project[7] originally planned two renewable power facilities constructed 90km north of Powell River, BC at the headwaters of Toba Inlet the first is on Jimmie Creek which flows west into Toba River and the second on the Upper Toba River. Installed capacity of the two facilities was to be 124 MW with an expected annual energy generation of 316 GW hr/yr. Alterra received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the Upper Toba facility.[7] In 2013 Alterra also received an Energy Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro to construct the 62MW Jimmie Creek facility.[8] In 2016 Alterra Power Corp. announced that the Jimmie Creek facility had achieved its full output of 62 MW.[9] It is located at 50°34′08″N 124°04′21″W﻿ / ﻿50.568962°N 124.072627°W﻿ / 50.568962; -124.072627
Bute Inlet[edit]
The Bute Inlet Hydroelectric project[10] consists of 17 facilities at the headwaters of Bute Inlet, located about 150–200 km (93–124 mi) north of Powell River, British Columbia. Combined, these facilities have a potential capacity of 1027 MW with potential energy generation of 2905 GWh per year.
This project was not awarded an energy contract from BC Hydro, and therefore is currently not proceeding.
Solar power expansions[edit]
In early 2011, Plutonic Power agreed, together with GE Energy financial Services, to purchase three proposed photovoltaic power plants in Ontario from First Solar. The three plants will have a total capacity of 50 MW, divided between Amherstburg (10MW), Belmont (20MW) and Walpole (20MW). This represents a first venture into solar power for Plutonic Power although engineering, procurement, construction and operation will still be provided by First Solar.[11]
Orka's controversy[edit]
In 2010, during the Icelandic financial crisis, Magma Energy acquired 98.5% of shares in the Icelandic geothermal power company HS Orka.[12] The deal created an opposition in Iceland. On May 21, 2010 Icelandic singer Björk wrote an open letter in the newspaper Reykjavík Grapevine, calling on the Icelandic government to "do everything in its power to revoke the contracts with Magma Energy".[13] The deal was approved by the Icelandic Government.[14] Recently Alterra as operator has 67%, while the Icelandic pension funds helds 33%.[15]
