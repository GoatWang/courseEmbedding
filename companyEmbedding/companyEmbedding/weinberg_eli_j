Title: Cfo & Institutional Trading/sales Operations Manaager
               Company: Drexel Burnham Lambert
Job Details
               DBL Holdings, LLC (dba Drexel Burnham Lambert) is dedicated to providing high quality financial services, particularly in the leveraged finance area, to Middle Market businesses and investors. The Middle Market is defined to include small and mid-sized public and private companies, aspiring and successful entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial companies, and special situations (e.g., "distressed, under-appreciated and turnaround" situations, "premature IPO companies and orphans," and "fallen angels"). The Company focuses on transaction sizes between $50 million and $250 million. In addition, the Company targets institutions and individuals with an interest in investing in such Midddle Market businesses, as well as providing financing and other products/services to them. The Company's Middle Market banking efforts include capabilities in investment banking (e.g., leveraged finance, general advisory services, public offerings, private placements, mergers and acquisitions, and restructuring and distressed services), as well as fixed income sales and trading, and certain areas of asset management that are well-suited to a Middle Market business (e.g., credit instrument management, and merchant banking--the ability to commit capital to its clients' financing needs). (The Company is considering establishing a focused equity sales and trading capability at the appropriate time.) These capabilities all are supported by the necessary research and analytical resources. Through the Company's relationship with The Concorde Group, Inc., the Company expects to have the capacity to provide other financial products/services to its client base, such as commercial finance/leasing as well as a specialized commercial banking capability. In addition to Concorde, the Company is developing significant client, transaction and capital sourcing relationships with other financial institutions, companies and individuals.
