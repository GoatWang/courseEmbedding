	FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS




	 




	The
	information discussed in this annual report on Form 10-K includes “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking
	statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”),
	and applicable Canadian securities laws. These forward-looking statements may include statements regarding perceived merit of
	properties, exploration results and budgets, mineral reserves and resource estimates, work programs, capital expenditures, operating
	costs, cash flow estimates, production estimates and similar statements relating to the economic viability of a project, timelines,
	strategic plans, statements relating anticipated activity with respect to the Ambler Mining District Industrial Access Project
	(“AMDIAP”), the Company’s plans and expectations relating to the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, completion of
	transactions, market prices for precious and base metals, or other statements that are not statements of fact. These statements
	relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable
	and assumptions of management.




	 




	Statements
	concerning mineral resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute “forward-looking statements” to the extent
	that they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered if the property is developed. Any statements that express
	or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future
	events or performance (often, but not always, identified by words or phrases such as “expects”, “is expected”,
	“anticipates”, “believes”, “plans”, “projects”, “estimates”, “assumes”,
	“intends”, “strategy”, “goals”, “objectives”, “potential”, “possible”
	or variations thereof or stating that certain actions, events, conditions or results “may”, “could”, “would”,
	“should”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these
	terms and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
	are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results
	to differ from those reflected in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:




	 








	·

	·




	risks
	related to lack of infrastructure including but not limited to the risk whether or not

	Development and Export Authority (“AIDEA”) will build the AMDIAP;






	 








	·




	uncertainty
	as to whether there will ever be production at the Company’s mineral exploration

	adequate financing for our planned exploration and development activities;

	·




	risks
	related to future sales or issuances of equity securities decreasing the value of existing
	Trilogy common shares (“Common Shares”), diluting voting power and reducing

	and development risks, including risks related to infrastructure, accidents, equipment
	breakdowns, labor disputes or other unanticipated difficulties with or interruptions
	in development, construction or production;






	 








	·




	the
	risk that permits and governmental approvals necessary to develop and operate mines at

	related to the need for reclamation activities on our properties and uncertainty of cost
	estimates related thereto;

	·




	risks
	related to increases in demand for equipment, skilled labor and services needed for exploration
	and development of mineral properties, and related cost increases;






	 








	·




	our
	need to attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel;






	 








	·




	risks
	related to conflicts of interests of some of our directors;






	 








	·




	risks
	related to potential future litigation;






	 








	·




	risks
	related to the voting power of our major shareholders and the impact that a sale by such
	shareholders may have on our share price;






	 








	·




	risks
	related to global climate change;






	 








	·




	risks
	related to adverse publicity from non-governmental organizations;






	 








	·




	uncertainty
	as to the volatility in the price of the Company’s shares;






	 








	·




	the
	Company’s expectation of not paying cash dividends;






	 






	3






	 





	 








	·




	adverse
	federal income tax consequences for U.S. shareholders should the Company be a passive
	foreign investment company;






	 








	·




	uncertainty
	as to our ability to maintain the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting
	as per the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”);
	and






	 








	·




	increased
	regulatory compliance costs, associated with rules and regulations promulgated by the
	SEC, Canadian Securities Administrators, the NYSE-MKT, the TSX, and the Financial Accounting
	Standards Boards, and more specifically, our efforts to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall
	Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”).






	 




	This
	list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements
	about the future and are inherently uncertain, and our actual achievements or other future events or conditions may differ materially
	from those reflected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including,
	without limitation, those referred to in this report under the heading “Risk Factors” and elsewhere.




	 




	Our
	forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, expectations and opinions of management on the date the statements are made,
	and we do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management’s beliefs, expectations
	or opinions should change, except as required by law. For the reasons set forth above, investors should not place undue reliance
	on forward-looking statements.




	 






	CAUTIONARY
	NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS




	 




	Unless otherwise
	indicated, all resource estimates, and any future reserve estimates, included or incorporated by reference in this annual report
	on Form 10-K have been, and will be, prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101

	Standards of Disclosure
	for Mineral Projects

	(“NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards
	for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (“CIM Definition Standards”). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian
	Securities Administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information
	concerning mineral projects. NI 43-101 permits the disclosure of an historical estimate made prior to the adoption of NI 43-101
	that does not comply with NI 43-101 to be disclosed using the historical terminology if the disclosure: (a) identifies the source
	and date of the historical estimate; (b) comments on the relevance and reliability of the historical estimate; (c) to the extent
	known, provides the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to prepare the historical estimate; (d) states whether the historical
	estimate uses categories other than those prescribed by NI 43-101; and (e) includes any more recent estimates or data available.




	 




	Canadian
	standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC, and reserve and resource information contained
	or incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S.
	companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term “resource” does not equate
	to the term “reserves”. Under SEC Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve”
	unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the
	time the reserve determination is made. SEC Industry Guide 7 does not define and the SEC’s disclosure standards normally
	do not permit the inclusion of information concerning “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources”
	or “inferred mineral resources” or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do
	not constitute “reserves” by U.S. standards in documents filed with the SEC. U.S. investors should also understand
	that “inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as
	to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an “inferred mineral resource”
	will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimated “inferred mineral resources” may not form
	the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any
	part of an “inferred mineral resource” exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of “contained
	ounces” in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers
	to report mineralization that does not constitute “reserves” by SEC standards as in-place tonnage and grade without
	reference to unit measures. The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of “reserves” are also not the same as
	those of the SEC, and any reserves reported by us in the future in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as “reserves”
	under SEC standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable to information
	made public by companies that report in accordance with United States standards.

	CAUTIONARY
	NOTE TO ALL INVESTORS CONCERNING ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS THAT INCLUDE INFERRED RESOURCES





	 




	Mineral
	resources that are not mineral reserves have no demonstrated economic viability. The preliminary assessment on the Arctic Project
	is preliminary in nature and includes “inferred mineral resources” that are considered too speculative geologically
	to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty
	that the feasibility studies or preliminary assessments at the Arctic Project will ever be realized.

	CIM
	Definition Standards, adopted by CIM Council on May 10, 2014



	1



	:




	 




	“


	feasibility
	study

		 means a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option
	for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments of applicable modifying factors together with any other
	relevant operational factors and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that
	the extraction is reasonably justified (economically mineable). The results of the study may reasonably serve as the basis for
	a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. The confidence
	level of the study will be higher than that of a pre-feasibility study.





	 




	“


	indicated
	mineral resource

	” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality,
	densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors
	in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is
	derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade
	or quality continuity between points of observation. An indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying
	to a measured mineral resource and may only be converted to a probable mineral reserve.





	 




	“


	inferred
	mineral resource

	” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or
	quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but
	not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that
	applied to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority
	of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration.





	 




	“


	measured
	mineral resource

	” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality,
	densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors
	to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived
	from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity
	between points of observation. A measured mineral resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an indicated
	mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource. It may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve.





	 




	“


	mineral
	reserve

	” means the economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated mineral resource.
	It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined
	by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors. Such studies
	demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. The reference point at which mineral reserves
	are defined, usually the point where the ore is delivered to the processing plant, must be stated. It is important that, in all
	situations where the reference point is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement is included to ensure
	that the reader is fully informed as to what is being reported. The public disclosure of a mineral reserve must be demonstrated
	by a pre-feasibility or feasibility study.





	 




	“


	mineral
	resource

	” means a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in
	or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic
	extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geologic characteristics of a mineral resource are
	known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling.

	“

	modifying
	factors

	” means the considerations used to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves. These include, but are not
	restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental
	factors.




	 




	“

	pre-feasibility
	study (preliminary feasibility study)

	” means a comprehensive study or a range of options for the technical and economic
	viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where a preferred mining method, in the case of underground mining,
	or the pit configuration, in the case of an open pit, is established and an effective method of mineral processing is determined.
	It includes a financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions on the modifying factors and the evaluation of any other relevant
	factors which are sufficient for a Qualified Person, acting reasonably, to determine if all or part of the mineral resource many
	be converted to a mineral reserve at the time of reporting. A pre-feasibility study is at a lower confidence level than a feasibility
	study.




	 




	“


	probable
	mineral reserve

	” means the economically mineable part of an indicated, and in some circumstances,
	a measured mineral resource. The confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that
	applying to a proven mineral reserve.





	 




	“


	proven
	mineral reserve

	” means the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource.
	A proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors.

	:




	 




	“


	indicated
	mineral resource

	” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality,
	densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate
	application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.
	The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from
	locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity
	to be reasonably assumed.





	 




	“


	inferred
	mineral resource

	” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or
	quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence, limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological
	and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations
	such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.





	 




	“


	measured
	mineral resource

	” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality,
	densities, shape and physical characteristics are so well-established that they can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient
	to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic
	viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered
	through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely
	enough for both geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assured.





	 




	“


	mineral
	reserve

	” means the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource
	demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. This study must include adequate information on mining, processing,
	metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be
	justified. A mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined.





	 




	“


	mineral
	resource

	” means a concentration or occurrence of natural solid inorganic material, or
	natural solid fossilized organic material in or on the earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality
	that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity
	of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.

	deposit is one which is not in either the development or
	production stage.





	 




	“

	development
	stage

	” project is one which is undergoing preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for its extraction
	but which is not yet in production. This stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study.




	 




	“

	mineralized
	material

	demonstration for economic or legal extraction.





	 





	“

	probable
	reserve

	” refers to reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that
	used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise
	less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity
	between points of observation.

	or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling
	and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content
	of reserves are well-established.




	 




	“

	reserve

	”
	refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve
	determination. Reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction.
	(“Bankable standards” implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is
	sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing.) A reserve includes adjustments to the in-situ tonnes and
	grade to include diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined.

	BUSINESS






	 




	Our principal business
	is the exploration and development of our Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (“Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects” or “UKMP
	Projects”) located in the Ambler mining district in Northwest Alaska, United States, comprising the (i) Arctic Project,
	which contains a high-grade polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulfide (“VMS”) deposit (“Arctic Project”);
	and (ii) Bornite Project, which contains a carbonate-hosted copper deposit (“Bornite Project”). Our goals include
	expanding mineral resources and advancing our projects through technical, engineering and feasibility studies so that production
	decisions can be made on those projects. Our UKMP Projects are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary, NovaCopper US Inc. (“NovaCopper
	US”) (dba Trilogy Metals US), registered to do business in the State of Alaska.




	 




	Name,
	Address and Incorporation




	 




	Trilogy Metals
	Inc. was incorporated on April 27, 2011 under the name NovaCopper Inc. pursuant to the terms of the

	Business Corporations Act

	(British Columbia) (“BCBCA”). NovaCopper Inc. changed its name to Trilogy Metals Inc. on September 1, 2016 to
	better reflect its diversified metals resource base. Our registered office is located at Suite 2600, Three Bentall Centre, 595
	Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and our executive office is located at Suite 1950, 777 Dunsmuir Street, Vancouver,
	British Columbia, Canada.

	Business
	Cycle




	 




	Our business, at
	its current exploration phase, is cyclical. Exploration activities are conducted primarily during snow-free months in Alaska.
	The optimum field season at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects is from late May to late September. The length of the snow-free season
	at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects varies from about May through November at lower elevations and from July through September
	at higher elevations.




	 




	Trilogy’s
	Strategy




	 




	Our business strategy
	is focused on creating value for stakeholders through our ownership and advancement of the Arctic Project and exploration of the
	Bornite Project and through the pursuit of similarly attractive mining projects. We plan to:




	 








	·




	advance
	the Arctic Project towards development with key activities including increased definition
	of the NI 43-101 mineral resources, technical studies to support completion of a pre-feasibility
	or feasibility study, and the advancement of baseline environmental studies;






	 








	·




	advance
	exploration in the Ambler mining district and, in particular, at the Bornite Project,
	pursuant to the NANA Agreement (as more particularly described under “

	History
	of Trilogy – Agreement with NANA Regional Corporation

	”) through resource
	development and initial technical studies; and






	 








	·




	pursue
	project level or corporate transactions that are value accretive.






	 




	The Arctic Project
	PEA represents an early stage study and highlights certain opportunities for us to further expand upon. Prior to commencing production,
	further studies that demonstrate the economic viability of the Arctic Project must be completed including pre-feasibility or feasibility
	studies, all necessary permits must be obtained, a production decision must be made by our board of directors (the “Board”),
	financing for construction and development must be arranged and construction must be completed. In addition, we will be required
	to address certain infrastructure challenges, including a road for access, transportation of supplies and mineral concentrate,
	and obtain additional rights, including surface use rights and access rights. See “

	Item 1A. Risk Factors.

	”




	 




	Significant
	Developments in 2016




	 








	·




	On
	April 19, 2016, we released an updated resource estimate on the Bornite Project and on
	May 16, 2016 filed the NI 43-101 compliant Bornite Report (as defined herein). Shallow
	mineralization located in the Ruby Creek Zones, in the Upper and Lower Reefs are reported
	within a resource limiting pit shell. Indicated in-pit resources at the Bornite deposit
	at a 0.50% copper cutoff are 40.5 million tonnes at 1.02% copper grade. Inferred in-pit
	resources at the Bornite deposit at a 0.50% copper cutoff are 84.1 million tonnes at
	0.95% copper grade. In addition to the in-pit resources, Inferred below pit resources
	at the Bornite deposit are reported (at an elevated 1.5% copper cutoff) as 57.8 million
	tonnes at 2.89% copper grade. Contained copper in Indicated Resources has increased from
	334 to 913 million pounds constituting a 173% increase in contained metal. Total contained
	copper in Inferred Resources has decreased from 5,696 to 5,450 million pounds (1,768Mlbs
	in-pit and 3,683Mlbs below-pit) which constitutes a 4% decrease in contained metal due
	principally to moving in-pit Inferred Resources to the Indicated category. The update
	incorporated a new 3D lithology, alteration and structural model for the Bornite deposit,
	as well as results from previously un-sampled or partially sampled historical Kennecott
	drill core. Inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence
	and whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed that all
	or any part of the Inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Mineral
	Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

	On
	October 27, 2016, we released the drill results from the safe and successful 2016 summer
	field program for the Arctic Project. We completed thirteen diamond drill holes for a
	total of 3,058 meters of core. The 2016 drill program was designed to collect data for
	geotechnical, hydrological, waste rock characterization and metallurgical studies as
	well as further resource definition. Three drill holes representing 822 meters drilled
	were designed to collect geotechnical and hydrological data within the proposed Arctic
	open-pit. Four drill holes representing 1,030 meters drilled were designed to collect
	metallurgical samples, specifically targeting material within the initial production
	years of the Arctic open-pit. Six drill holes representing 1,206 meters drilled were
	designed to evaluate vertical and lateral continuity of the high grade polymetallic copper,
	gold, silver, lead, and zinc mineralization, and support upgrading of Inferred resources
	to Measured and Indicated resource classification within the area of the proposed Arctic
	open-pit. We were pleased to announce that all six infill holes encountered mineralized
	intervals consistent with previous drilling conducted within the resource area on the
	property. The updated geology domains and drill data will be incorporated into an updated
	resource estimate that will support a future pre-feasibility study. In addition to the
	drill program, we conducted an aquatics survey, avian survey, habitat survey, archaeological
	survey, and wetlands delineation survey, and continued ongoing baseline environmental
	data collection and acid-base-accounting/metal leaching sampling. The LiDAR survey that
	was incomplete last year due to weather conditions was also completed during the summer
	field program.

	0.5% copper cut-off grade, the Bornite Project was estimated to contain in-pit Inferred
	Resources of 109.6 million tonnes of 0.94% Cu or 2,259 million pounds of contained copper.
	Resources were stated as potentially being economically viable in an open-pit mining
	scenario based on a projected metal price of $3.00 per pound copper, total site operating
	costs of $18.00 per tonne, 87% metallurgical recoveries and an average pit slope of 43

	Agreement
	with NANA Regional Corporation






	 




	On October 19,
	2011, NANA Regional Corporation, Inc. (“NANA”), an Alaska Native Corporation headquartered in Kotzebue, Alaska, and
	NovaCopper US entered an Exploration Agreement and Option Agreement, as amended (the “NANA Agreement”) for the cooperative
	development of NANA’s respective resource interests in the Ambler mining district of Northwest Alaska. The NANA Agreement
	consolidates our and NANA’s land holdings into an approximately 142,831-hectare land package and provides a framework for
	the exploration and any future development of this high-grade and prospective poly-metallic belt.




	 






	14






	 





	 




	The NANA Agreement
	grants NovaCopper US the nonexclusive right to enter on, and the exclusive right to explore, the Bornite lands and the Alaska
	Native Claims Settlement Act (“ANCSA”) lands (each as defined in the NANA Agreement) and in connection therewith,
	to construct and utilize temporary access roads, camps, airstrips and other incidental works. In consideration for this right,
	NovaCopper US paid to NANA $4 million in cash. NovaCopper US is also required to make payments to NANA for scholarship purposes
	in accordance with the terms of the NANA Agreement. NovaCopper US has further agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to train
	and employ NANA shareholders to perform work for NovaCopper US in connection with its operations on the Bornite lands, ANCSA lands
	and Ambler lands (as defined in the NANA Agreement) (collectively, the “Lands”). Under the NANA Agreement, NANA also
	has the right to appoint a board member to Trilogy’s Board within a five year period following our public listing on a stock
	exchange.




	 




	The NANA Agreement
	has a term of 20 years, with an option in favour of NovaCopper US


	to extend the term for an additional 10 years. The
	NANA Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or by NANA if NovaCopper US


	does not meet certain expenditure
	requirements on the Bornite lands and ANCSA lands.




	 




	If, following receipt
	of a feasibility study and the release for public comment of a related draft environmental impact statement, we decide to proceed
	with construction of a mine on the Lands, NovaCopper US will notify NANA in writing and NANA will have 120 days to elect
	to either (a) exercise a non-transferrable back-in-right to acquire an undivided ownership interest between 16% and 25% (as specified
	by NANA) of that specific project; or (b) not exercise its back-in-right, and instead receive a net proceeds royalty equal to
	15% of the net proceeds realized by NovaCopper US from such project (following the recoupment by NovaCopper US of all costs incurred,
	including operating, capital and carrying costs). The cost to exercise such back-in-right is equal to the percentage interest
	in the project multiplied by the difference between (i) all costs incurred by NovaCopper US or its affiliates on the project,
	including historical costs incurred prior to the date of the NANA Agreement together with interest on the costs; and (ii) $40 million
	(subject to exceptions). This amount will be payable by NANA to NovaCopper US


	in cash at the time the parties enter into
	a joint venture agreement and in no event will the amount be less than zero.




	 




	In the event that
	NANA elects to exercise its back-in-right, the parties will as soon as reasonably practicable form a joint venture, with NANA’s
	interest being between 16% to 25% and NovaCopper US owning the balance of the interest in the joint venture. Upon formation of
	the joint venture, the joint venture will assume all of the obligations of NovaCopper US and be entitled to all the benefits of
	NovaCopper US under the NANA Agreement in connection with the mine to be developed and the related Lands. A party’s failure
	to pay its proportionate share of costs in connection with the joint venture will result in dilution of its interest. Each party
	will have a right of first refusal over any proposed transfer of the other party’s interest in the joint venture other than
	to an affiliate or for the purposes of granting security. A transfer by either party of any net proceeds royalty interest in a
	project other than for financing purposes will also be subject to a first right of refusal. A transfer of NANA’s net smelter
	return on the Lands is subject to a first right of refusal by NovaCopper US.




	 




	In connection with
	possible development of a mine on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands, NovaCopper US and NANA will execute a mining lease to allow
	NovaCopper US or the joint venture to construct and operate a mine on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands. These leases will provide
	NANA a 2% net smelter royalty as to production from the Bornite lands and a 2.5% net smelter royalty as to production from the
	ANCSA lands. If NovaCopper US decides to proceed with construction of a mine on the Ambler lands, NANA will enter into a surface
	use agreement with NovaCopper US which will afford NovaCopper US access to the Ambler lands along routes approved by NANA on the
	Bornite lands or ANCSA lands. In consideration for the grant of such surface use rights, NovaCopper US will grant NANA a 1% net
	smelter royalty on production and an annual payment of $755 per acre (as adjusted for inflation each year beginning with the second
	anniversary of the effective date of the NANA Agreement and for each of the first 400 acres (and $100 for each additional
	acre) of the lands owned by NANA and used for access which are disturbed and not reclaimed.




	 




	We have formed
	an oversight committee with NANA, which consists of four representatives from each of Trilogy and NANA (the “Oversight Committee”).
	The Oversight Committee is responsible for certain planning and oversight matters carried out by us under the NANA Agreement.
	The planning and oversight matters that are the subject of the NANA Agreement will be determined by majority vote. The representatives
	of each of Trilogy and NANA attending a meeting will have one vote in the aggregate and in the event of a tie, the Trilogy representatives
	jointly shall have a deciding vote on all matters other than Subsistence Matters, as that term is defined in the NANA Agreement.
	There shall be no deciding vote on Subsistence Matters and we may not proceed with such matters unless approved by majority vote
	of the Oversight Committee or with the consent of NANA, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

	Specialized
	Skill and Knowledge




	 




	All aspects of
	our business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, mining and accounting.

	management.





	 






	Environmental
	Protection





	 




	Mining is an extractive
	industry that impacts the environment. Our goal is to evaluate ways to minimize that impact and to develop safe, responsible and
	profitable operations by developing natural resources for the benefit of our employees, shareholders and communities and maintain
	high standards for environmental performance at our UKMP Projects. We strive to meet or exceed environmental standards at our
	UKMP Projects. One way we do this is through collaborations with local communities in Alaska, including Native Alaskan groups.
	Our environmental performance will be overseen at the Board level and environmental performance is the responsibility of the project
	manager.




	 








	·




	All
	new activities and operations will be managed for compliance with applicable laws and
	regulations. In the absence of regulation, best management practices will be applied
	to manage environmental risk.






	 








	·




	We
	will strive to limit releases to the air, land or water and appropriately treat and dispose
	of waste.

	Employees




	 




	As of November
	30, 2016, we had 7 full-time employees, all of whom were employed at our executive office in Vancouver, BC. The number of individuals
	employed by us fluctuates throughout the year depending on the season; however, during 2016, we had, on average, 15 employees
	working for us. We have entered into executive employment agreements with two individuals, the CEO and CFO.




	 




	We believe our
	success is dependent on the performance of our management and key employees, many of whom have specialized skills in exploration
	in Alaska and the base metals industry. Substantially all of our exploration site employees have been active in the Ambler mining
	district for the last five years and are knowledgeable as to the geology, metallurgy and infrastructure related to mining development.

	Competitive
	Conditions




	 




	The mineral exploration
	and development industry is competitive in all phases of exploration, development and production. There is a high degree of competition
	faced by us in Alaska and elsewhere for skilled management employees, suitable contractors for drilling operations, technical
	and engineering resources, and necessary exploration and mining equipment, and many of these competitor companies have greater
	financial resources, operational expertise, and/or more advanced properties than us. Additionally, our operations are in a remote
	location where skilled resources and support services are limited. We have in place experienced management personnel and continue
	to evaluate the required expertise and skills to carry out our operations. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to
	achieve our exploration and development in the future on terms we consider acceptable or at all. See “

	Item 1A.




	RISK FACTORS






	 




	Investing in our
	securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk due to the nature of our business and the present stage of exploration
	of our mineral properties. The following risk factors, as well as risks currently unknown to us, could materially adversely affect
	our future business, operations and financial condition and could cause them to differ materially from the estimates described
	in forward-looking information relating to Trilogy, or our business, property or financial results, each of which could cause
	purchasers of securities to lose all or part of their investments.




	 






	17






	 





	 




	We
	have not defined any proven or probable reserves and none of our mineral properties are in production or under development.




	 




	We have no history
	of commercially producing precious or base metals and all of our properties are in the exploration stage. We have not defined
	or delineated any measured mineral resources or proven or probable reserves on our Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects. Mineral exploration
	involves significant risk, since few properties that are explored contain bodies of ore that would be commercially economic to
	develop into producing mines. We cannot assure you that we will establish the presence of any measured resources, or proven or
	probable reserves at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, or any other properties. The failure to establish measured mineral resources,
	or proven or probable reserves, would severely restrict our ability to implement our strategies for long-term growth.




	 




	We
	may not have sufficient funds to develop our mineral projects or to complete further exploration programs.




	 




	We have limited
	financial resources. We currently generate no mining operating revenue, and must primarily finance exploration activity and the
	development of mineral projects by other means. In the future, our ability to continue exploration, development and production
	activities, if any, will depend on our ability to obtain additional external financing. Any unexpected costs, problems or delays
	could severely impact our ability to continue exploration and development activities. The failure to meet ongoing obligations
	on a timely basis could result in a loss or a substantial dilution of our interests in projects.




	 




	The sources of
	external financing that we may use for these purposes include project or bank financing or public or private offerings of equity
	and debt. In addition, we may enter into one or more strategic alliances or joint ventures, decide to sell certain property interests,
	or utilize one or a combination of all of these alternatives. The financing alternative we choose may not be available on acceptable
	terms, or at all. If additional financing is not available, we may have to postpone further exploration or development of, or
	sell, one or more of our principal properties.




	 




	Even
	if one of our mineral projects is determined to be economically viable to develop into a mine, such development may not be successful.




	 




	If the development
	of one of our projects is found to be economically feasible and approved by our Board, such development will require obtaining
	permits and financing, the construction and operation of mines, processing plants and related infrastructure, including road access.
	As a result, we are and will continue to be subject to all of the risks associated with establishing new mining operations, including:

	timing and cost, which can be considerable, of the construction of mining and processing
	facilities and related infrastructure;






	 








	·




	the
	availability and cost of skilled labor and mining equipment;

	·




	potential
	increases in construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, power,
	materials and supplies.






	 




	The costs, timing
	and complexities of developing our projects may be greater than anticipated because our property interests are not located in
	developed areas, and, as a result, our property interests are not currently served by appropriate road access, water and power
	supply and other support infrastructure. Cost estimates may increase significantly as more detailed engineering work is completed
	on a project. It is common in new mining operations to experience unexpected costs, problems and delays during construction, development
	and mine start-up. In addition, delays in the early stages of mineral production often occur. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance
	that we will ever achieve, or that our activities will result in, profitable mining operations at our mineral properties.

	In addition, there
	can be no assurance that our mineral exploration activities will result in any discoveries of new mineralization. If further mineralization
	is discovered there is also no assurance that the mineralization would be economical for commercial production. Discovery of mineral
	deposits is dependent upon a number of factors and significantly influenced by the technical skill of the exploration personnel
	involved. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit is also dependent upon a number of factors which are beyond our control,
	including the attributes of the deposit, commodity prices, government policies and regulation and environmental protection.




	 




	The
	Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects are located in a remote area of Alaska, and access to them is limited. Exploration and any future
	development or production activities may be limited and delayed by infrastructure challenges, inclement weather and a shortened
	exploration season.




	 




	The Upper Kobuk
	Mineral Projects are located in a remote area of Alaska. Access to the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects is limited and there is currently
	no infrastructure in the area.




	 




	We cannot provide
	assurances that the proposed AMDIAP that would provide access to the Ambler mining district will be permitted or built, that it
	will be built in a timely manner, that the cost of accessing the proposed road will be reasonable, that it will be built in the
	manner contemplated, or that it will sufficiently satisfy the requirements of the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects. In addition, successful
	development of the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects will require the development of the necessary infrastructure. If adequate infrastructure
	is not available in a timely manner, there can be no assurance that:




	 








	·




	the
	development of the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects will be commenced or completed on a timely
	basis, if at all;






	 








	·




	the
	resulting operations will achieve the anticipated production volume; or






	 








	·




	the
	construction costs and operating costs associated with the development of the Upper Kobuk
	Mineral Projects will not be higher than anticipated.






	 




	As the Upper Kobuk
	Mineral Projects are located in a remote area, exploration, development and production activities may be limited and delayed by
	inclement weather and a shortened exploration season.




	 




	We
	have no history of production and no revenue from mining operations.




	 




	We have a very
	limited history of operations and to date have generated no revenue from mining operations. As such, we are subject to many risks
	common to such enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial and
	other resources and lack of significant revenues. There is no assurance that the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, or any other future
	projects will be commercially mineable, and we may never generate revenues from our mining operations.




	 




	Future
	sales or issuances of equity securities could decrease the value of any existing Common Shares, dilute investors’ voting
	power and reduce our earnings per share.




	 




	We may sell additional
	equity securities (including through the sale of securities convertible into Common Shares) and may issue additional equity securities
	to finance our operations, exploration, development, acquisitions or other projects. We are authorized to issue an unlimited number
	of Common Shares. We cannot predict the size of future sales and issuances of equity securities or the effect, if any, that future
	sales and issuances of equity securities will have on the market price of the Common Shares. Sales or issuances of a substantial
	number of equity securities, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for
	the Common Shares. With any additional sale or issuance of equity securities, investors will suffer dilution of their voting power
	and may experience dilution in our earnings per share.




	 




	Changes
	in the market price of copper, gold and other metals, which in the past have fluctuated widely, will affect our ability to finance
	continued exploration and development of our projects and affect our operations and financial condition.




	 




	Our long-term viability
	will depend, in large part, on the market price of copper, gold and other metals. The market prices for these metals are volatile
	and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:




	 






	19






	 





	 








	·




	global
	or regional consumption patterns;






	 








	·




	the
	supply of, and demand for, these metals;






	 








	·




	speculative
	activities;






	 








	·




	the
	availability and costs of metal substitutes;






	 








	·




	expectations
	for inflation; and






	 








	·




	political
	and economic conditions, including interest rates and currency values.






	 




	We cannot predict
	the effect of these factors on metal prices. A decrease in the market price of copper, gold and other metals could affect our
	ability to raise funds to finance the exploration and development of any of our mineral projects, which would have a material
	adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The market price of copper, gold and other metals may not
	remain at current levels. In particular, an increase in worldwide supply, and consequent downward pressure on prices, may result
	over the longer term from increased copper production from mines developed or expanded as a result of current metal price levels.
	There is no assurance that a profitable market may exist or continue to exist.




	 




	Actual
	capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns may differ significantly from those described in the PEA.




	 




	The PEA technical
	report for the Arctic Project is an early stage study that is preliminary in nature. There can be no assurance that the results
	described in the PEA will be realized. The capital costs to take our projects into production may be significantly higher than
	anticipated.




	 




	None of our mineral
	properties have an operating history upon which we can base estimates of future operating costs. Decisions about the development
	of the Arctic Project (or the Bornite Project) will ultimately be based upon feasibility studies. Feasibility studies derive estimates
	of cash operating costs based upon, among other things:




	 








	·




	anticipated
	tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed;






	 








	·




	anticipated
	recovery rates of metals from the ore;






	 








	·




	cash
	operating costs of comparable facilities and equipment; and






	 








	·




	anticipated
	climatic conditions.






	 




	Cash operating
	costs, production and economic returns, and other estimates contained in studies or estimates prepared by or for us may differ
	significantly from those anticipated by the PEA and there can be no assurance that our actual operating costs will not be higher
	than currently anticipated.




	 




	We
	will incur losses for the foreseeable future.




	 




	We expect to incur
	losses unless and until such time as our mineral projects generate sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. The exploration
	and development of our mineral properties will require the commitment of substantial financial resources that may not be available.




	 




	The amount and
	timing of expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of ongoing exploration and development, the
	results of consultants’ analyses and recommendations, the rate at which operating losses are incurred, the execution of
	any joint venture agreements with strategic partners and the acquisition of additional property interests, some of which are beyond
	our control. We cannot provide assurance that we will ever achieve profitability.






	20






	 





	 




	Mineral
	resource and reserve calculations are only estimates.




	 




	Any figures presented
	for mineral resources in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with securities regulatory authorities and those which may be
	presented in the future or any figures for mineral reserves that may be presented by us in the future are and will only be estimates.
	There is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of mineral reserves and mineral resources. Until mineral reserves
	or mineral resources are actually mined and processed, the quantity of metal and grades must be considered as estimates only and
	no assurances can be given that the indicated levels of metals will be produced. In making determinations about whether to advance
	any of our projects to development, we must rely upon estimated calculations as to the mineral resources and grades of mineralization
	on our properties.




	 




	The estimating
	of mineral reserves and mineral resources is a subjective process that relies on the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
	The process relies on the quantity and quality of available data and is based on knowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling
	results and industry practices. Valid estimates made at a given time may significantly change when new information becomes available.
	While we believe that the mineral resource estimates included in this Form 10-K for the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects are well-established
	and reflect management’s best estimates, by their nature mineral resource estimates are imprecise and depend, to a certain
	extent, upon analysis of drilling results and statistical inferences that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. There can be
	no assurances that actual results will meet the estimates contained in feasibility studies. As well, further studies are required.




	 




	Estimated mineral
	reserves or mineral resources may have to be recalculated based on changes in metal prices, further exploration or development
	activity or actual production experience. This could materially and adversely affect estimates of the volume or grade of mineralization,
	estimated recovery rates or other important factors that influence mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates. The extent to
	which mineral resources may ultimately be reclassified as mineral reserves is dependent upon the demonstration of their profitable
	recovery. Any material changes in mineral resource estimates and grades of mineralization will affect the economic viability of
	placing a property into production and a property’s return on capital. We cannot provide assurance that mineralization can
	be mined or processed profitably.




	 




	Our mineral resource
	estimates have been determined and valued based on assumed future metal prices, cut-off grades and operating costs that may prove
	to be inaccurate. Extended declines in market prices for copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver may render portions of our mineralization
	uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineral resources, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results
	of operations or financial condition. We cannot provide assurance that mineral recovery rates achieved in small scale tests will
	be duplicated in large scale tests under on-site conditions or in production scale.




	 




	A reduction in
	any mineral reserves that may be estimated by us in the future could have an adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings,
	results of operations and financial condition. No assurances can be given that any mineral resource estimates for the Upper Kobuk
	Mineral Projects will ultimately be reclassified as mineral reserves. See “

	Cautionary Note to United States Investors

	.”




	 




	Significant
	uncertainty exists related to inferred mineral resources.




	 




	There is a risk
	that inferred mineral resources referred to in this Form 10-K cannot be converted into measured or indicated mineral resources
	as there may be limited ability to assess geological continuity. Due to the uncertainty that may attach to inferred mineral resources,
	there is no assurance that inferred mineral resources will be upgraded to resources with sufficient geological continuity to constitute
	proven and probable mineral reserves as a result of continued exploration. See “

	Cautionary Note to United States Investors

	.”




	 




	Mining
	is inherently risky and subject to conditions or events beyond our control.




	 




	The development
	and operation of a mine is inherently dangerous and involves many risks that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful
	evaluation may not be able to overcome, including:




	 








	·




	unusual
	or unexpected geological formations;






	 








	·




	metallurgical
	and other processing problems;








	21






	 





	 








	·




	metal
	losses;






	 








	·




	environmental
	hazards;






	 








	·




	power
	outages;






	 








	·




	labor
	disruptions;






	 








	·




	industrial
	accidents;






	 








	·




	periodic
	interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions;






	 








	·




	flooding,
	explosions, fire, rockbursts, cave-ins and landslides;






	 








	·




	mechanical
	equipment and facility performance problems; and






	 








	·




	the
	availability of materials and equipment.






	 




	These risks could
	result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties, production facilities or other properties, personal injury or death,
	including to our employees, environmental damage, delays in mining, increased production costs, asset write downs, monetary losses
	and possible legal liability. We may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums, or
	at all. Insurance against certain environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution and other hazards associated
	with mineral exploration and production, is not generally available to companies within the mining industry. We may suffer a material
	adverse effect on our business if we incur losses related to any significant events that are not covered by our insurance policies.




	 




	General
	economic conditions may adversely affect our growth, future profitability and ability to finance.




	 




	The unprecedented
	events in global financial markets in the past several years have had a profound impact on the global economy. Many industries,
	including the copper mining industry, are impacted by these market conditions. Some of the key impacts of the current financial
	market turmoil include contraction in credit markets resulting in a widening of credit risk, devaluations, high volatility in
	global equity, commodity, foreign exchange and precious metal markets and a lack of market liquidity. A worsening or slowdown
	in the financial markets or other economic conditions, including but not limited to, consumer spending, employment rates, business
	conditions, inflation, fuel and energy costs, consumer debt levels, lack of available credit, the state of the financial markets,
	interest rates and tax rates, may adversely affect our growth and ability to finance. Specifically:




	 








	·




	the
	volatility of copper, gold and other metal prices would impact our estimates of mineral
	resources, revenues, profits, losses and cash flow, and the feasibility of our projects;






	 








	·




	negative
	economic pressures could adversely impact demand for our future production, if any;






	 








	·




	construction
	related costs could increase and adversely affect the economics of any project;






	 








	·




	volatile
	energy, commodity and consumables prices and currency exchange rates would impact our
	estimated production costs; and






	 








	·




	the
	devaluation and volatility of global stock markets would impact the valuation of our
	equity and other securities.






	 




	We
	cannot provide assurance that we will successfully acquire commercially mineable mineral rights.




	 




	Exploration for
	and development of copper and gold properties involves significant financial risks which even a combination of careful evaluation,
	experience and knowledge may not eliminate. While the discovery of an ore body may result in substantial rewards, few properties
	which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenses may be required to establish reserves by drilling,
	constructing mining and processing facilities at a site, developing metallurgical processes and extracting metals from ore. We
	cannot ensure that our current exploration and development programs will result in profitable commercial mining operations.






	22






	 





	 




	The economic feasibility
	of development projects is based upon many factors, including the accuracy of mineral resource estimates; metallurgical recoveries;
	capital and operating costs; government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and
	exporting and environmental protection; and metal prices, which are highly volatile. Development projects are also subject to
	the successful completion of feasibility studies, issuance of necessary governmental permits and availability of adequate financing.




	 




	Most exploration
	projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits, and no assurance can be given that any anticipated
	level of recovery of ore reserves, if any, will be realized or that any identified mineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially
	mineable (or viable) ore body which can be legally and economically exploited. Estimates of mineral reserves, mineral resources,
	mineral deposits and production costs can also be affected by such factors as environmental permitting regulations and requirements,
	weather, environmental factors, unforeseen technical difficulties, the metallurgy of the mineralization forming the mineral deposit,
	unusual or unexpected geological formations and work interruptions. If current exploration programs do not result in the discovery
	of commercial ore, we may need to write-off part or all of our investment in our existing exploration stage properties, and may
	need to acquire additional properties.




	 




	Material changes
	in mineral reserves, if any, grades, stripping ratios or recovery rates may affect the economic viability of any project. Our
	future growth and productivity will depend, in part, on our ability to develop commercially mineable mineral rights at our existing
	properties or identify and acquire other commercially mineable mineral rights, and on the costs and results of continued exploration
	and potential development programs. Mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature and is frequently non-productive. Substantial
	expenditures are required to:




	 








	·




	establish
	mineral reserves through drilling and metallurgical and other testing techniques;






	 








	·




	determine
	metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to extract metal from the ore; and






	 








	·




	construct,
	renovate or expand mining and processing facilities.






	 




	In addition, if
	we discover ore, it would take several years from the initial phases of exploration until production is possible. During this
	time, the economic feasibility of production may change. As a result of these uncertainties, there can be no assurance that we
	will successfully acquire commercially mineable (or viable) mineral rights.




	 




	We
	are subject to significant governmental regulations.




	 




	Our exploration
	activities are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations governing various matters, including:




	 








	·




	environmental
	protection;






	 








	·




	the
	management and use of toxic substances and explosives;






	 








	·




	the
	management of natural resources;






	 








	·




	the
	exploration and development of mineral properties, including reclamation;






	 








	·




	exports;






	 








	·




	price
	controls;






	 








	·




	taxation
	and mining royalties;






	 








	·




	management
	of tailing and other waste generated by operations;






	 








	·




	labor
	standards and occupational health and safety, including mine safety; and






	 








	·




	historic
	and cultural preservation.

	Failure to comply
	with applicable laws and regulations may result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including orders
	issued by regulatory or judicial authorities enjoining, curtailing or closing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation
	of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could result in significant expenditures. We may also be required to
	compensate private parties suffering loss or damage by reason of a breach of such laws, regulations or permitting requirements.
	It is also possible that future laws and regulations, or more stringent enforcement of current laws and regulations by governmental
	authorities, could cause us to incur additional expense or capital expenditure restrictions, suspensions or closing of our activities
	and delays in the exploration and development of our properties.




	 




	We
	require further permits in order to conduct current and anticipated future operations, and delays in obtaining or failure to obtain
	such permits, or a failure to comply with the terms of any such permits that we have obtained, would adversely affect our business.




	 




	Our current and
	anticipated future operations, including further exploration, development and commencement of production on our mineral properties,
	require permits from various governmental authorities. Obtaining or renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming
	process. The duration and success of efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control.
	Due to the preliminary stages of the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, it is difficult to assess what specific permitting requirements
	will ultimately apply.




	 




	Shortage of qualified
	and experienced personnel in the U.S. federal and Alaskan State agencies to coordinate a federally led joint environmental impact
	statement process could result in delays or inefficiencies. Backlog within the permitting agencies could affect the permitting
	timeline or potential of the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, as may negative public perception of mining projects in general due
	to circumstances unrelated to the Company and outside of its control. Other factors that could affect the permitting timeline
	include (i) the number of other large-scale projects currently in a more advanced stage of development which could slow down the
	review process for the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects and (ii) significant public response regarding the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects.




	 




	We cannot provide
	assurance that all permits that we require for our operations, including any for construction of mining facilities or conduct
	of mining, will be obtainable or renewable on reasonable terms, or at all. Delays or a failure to obtain such required permits,
	or the expiry, revocation or failure to comply with the terms of any such permits that we have obtained, would adversely affect
	our business.




	 




	Our
	activities are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs and restrict our operations.




	 




	All of our exploration,
	potential development and production activities are subject to regulation by governmental agencies under various environmental
	laws. These laws address emissions into the air, discharges into water, management of waste, management of hazardous substances,
	protection of natural resources, antiquities and endangered species and reclamation of lands disturbed by mining operations. Environmental
	legislation is evolving and the general trend has been towards stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties
	for noncompliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and increasing responsibility for companies and
	their officers, directors and employees. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant capital outlays
	on our behalf and may cause material changes or delays in our intended activities.




	 




	Several regulatory
	initiatives are currently ongoing within the State of Alaska that have the potential to influence the permitting process for the
	Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects. These include revisions to Alaska's Water Quality Standards regarding mixing zones regulations,
	which are currently under EPA review, and which revisions may be required in order to authorize a mixing zone for discharge in
	Subarctic Creek. Future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant adverse impact on some portion of our business,
	requiring us to re-evaluate those activities at that time.




	 




	Environmental hazards
	may exist on our properties that are unknown to us at the present time and that have been caused by previous owners or operators
	or that may have occurred naturally. We may be liable for remediating such damage.




	 




	Failure to comply
	with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions thereunder, including
	orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities, causing operations to cease or to be curtailed, and may include corrective
	measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions.






	24






	 





	 




	Land
	reclamation requirements for our exploration properties may be burdensome.




	 




	Land reclamation
	requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies (as well as companies with mining operations) in order to
	minimize long term effects of land disturbance. Reclamation may include requirements to:




	 








	·




	treat
	ground and surface water to drinking water standards;






	 








	·




	control
	dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents; and






	 








	·




	reasonably
	re-establish pre-disturbance land forms and vegetation.






	 




	In order to carry
	out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with exploration, potential development and production activities, we
	must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further exploration and development programs. In addition,
	regulatory changes could increase our obligations to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. If we are required to carry
	out unanticipated reclamation work, our financial position could be adversely affected.




	 




	Title
	and other rights to our properties may be subject to challenge.




	 




	We cannot provide
	assurance that title to our properties will not be challenged. We own mineral claims which constitute our property holdings. We
	may not have, or may not be able to obtain, all necessary surface rights to develop a property. Title insurance is generally not
	available for mineral properties and our ability to ensure that we have obtained a secure claim to individual mining properties
	may be severely constrained. Our mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and
	title may be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. We have not conducted surveys of all of the claims in which
	we hold direct or indirect interests. A successful claim contesting our title to a property will cause us to lose our rights to
	explore and, if warranted, develop that property or undertake or continue production thereon. This could result in our not being
	compensated for our prior expenditures relating to the property. In addition, our ability to continue to explore and develop the
	property may be subject to agreements with other third parties including agreements with native corporations and first nations
	groups, for instance, the lands at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects are subject to the NANA Agreement (as more particularly described
	under “

	History of Trilogy – Agreement with NANA Regional Corporation

	”).




	 




	Risks
	inherent in acquisitions of new properties.




	 




	We may actively
	pursue the acquisition of exploration, development and production assets consistent with our acquisition and growth strategy.
	From time to time, we may also acquire securities of or other interests in companies with respect to which we may enter into acquisitions
	or other transactions. Acquisition transactions involve inherent risks, including but not limited to:




	 








	·

	to

	operated, conducting and managing operations in a new operating environment.






	 




	Acquiring additional
	businesses or properties could place increased pressure on our cash flow if such acquisitions involve a cash consideration. The
	integration of our existing operations with any acquired business will require significant expenditures of time, attention and
	funds. Achievement of the benefits expected from consolidation would require us to incur significant costs in connection with,
	among other things, implementing financial and planning systems. We may not be able to integrate the operations of a recently
	acquired business or restructure our previously existing business operations without encountering difficulties and delays. In
	addition, this integration may require significant attention from our management team, which may detract attention from our day-to-day
	operations. Over the short-term, difficulties associated with integration could have a material adverse effect on our business,
	operating results, financial condition and the price of Trilogy Shares. In addition, the acquisition of mineral properties may
	subject us to unforeseen liabilities, including environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on us. There
	can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated into our existing operations.




	 




	Any one or more
	of these factors or other risks could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of properties or companies,
	and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.




	 




	High
	metal prices in past years have encouraged increased mining exploration, development and construction activity, which has increased
	demand for, and cost of, exploration, development and construction services and equipment.




	 




	The relative strength
	of metal prices in past years has encouraged increases in mining exploration, development and construction activities around the
	world, which has resulted in increased demand for, and cost of, exploration, development and construction services and equipment.
	While recent market conditions have had a moderating effect on the costs of such services and equipment, increases in such costs
	may continue with the resumption of an upward trend in metal prices. Increased demand for and cost of services and equipment could
	result in delays if services or equipment cannot be obtained in a timely manner due to inadequate availability, and may cause
	scheduling difficulties due to the need to coordinate the availability of services or equipment, any of which could materially
	increase project exploration, development and/or construction costs.




	 




	We
	face industry competition in the acquisition of exploration properties and the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel.




	 




	We compete with
	other exploration and producing companies, many of which are better capitalized, have greater financial resources, operational
	experience and technical capabilities or are further advanced in their development or are significantly larger and have access
	to greater mineral reserves, for the acquisition of mineral claims, leases and other mineral interests as well as for the recruitment
	and retention of qualified employees and other personnel. If we require and are unsuccessful in acquiring additional mineral properties
	or in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, we will not be able to grow at the rate we desire, or at all.




	 




	We
	may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management and technical personnel to grow our business.




	 




	We are dependent
	on the services of key executives and other highly skilled and experienced personnel to advance our corporate objectives as well
	as the identification of new opportunities for growth and funding. Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse and Ms. Sanders are currently our only
	executive officers. It will be necessary for us to recruit additional skilled and experienced executives. Our inability to do
	so, or the loss of any of these persons or our inability to attract and retain suitable replacements for them, or additional highly
	skilled employees required for our activities, would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.






	26






	 





	 




	Some
	of our directors and officers have conflicts of interest as a result of their involvement with other natural resource companies.




	 




	Certain of our
	directors and officers also serve as directors or officers, or have significant shareholdings, in other companies involved in
	natural resource exploration and development or mining-related activities, including, in particular, NovaGold. To the extent that
	such other companies may participate in ventures in which we may participate in, or in ventures which we may seek to participate
	in, our directors and officers may have a conflict of interest in negotiating and concluding terms respecting the extent of such
	participation. In all cases where our directors and officers have an interest in other companies, such other companies may also
	compete with us for the acquisition of mineral property investments. Any decision made by any of these directors and officers
	involving Trilogy will be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to deal fairly and in good faith with a view to
	the best interests of Trilogy and its shareholders. In addition, each of the directors is required to declare and refrain from
	voting on any matter in which these directors may have a conflict of interest in accordance with the procedures set forth in the

	Business Corporations Act

	(British Columbia) and other applicable laws. In appropriate cases, the Company will establish
	a special committee of independent directors to review a matter in which several directors, or management, may have a conflict.
	Nonetheless, as a result of these conflicts of interest, the Company may not have an opportunity to participate in certain transactions,
	which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.




	 




	In
	the future, we may be subject to legal proceedings.




	 




	Due to the nature
	of our business, we may be subject to numerous regulatory investigations, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings in the ordinary
	course of our business. The results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty due to the uncertainty inherent
	in litigation, including the effects of discovery of new evidence or advancement of new legal theories, the difficulty of predicting
	decisions of judges and juries and the possibility that decisions may be reversed on appeal. There can be no assurances that these
	matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business.




	 





	Our largest
	shareholder has significant influence on us and may also affect the market price and liquidity of the securities.





	 




	Electrum Strategic
	Opportunities Fund L.P. (“Electrum”) is our single largest shareholder, controlling approximately 21.3% of the outstanding
	voting securities. Accordingly, Electrum will have significant influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction
	or other matter submitted to the shareholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially
	all of our assets and other significant corporate actions. Unless significant participation of other shareholders takes place
	in such shareholder meetings, Electrum may be able to approve such matters itself. The concentration of ownership of the shares
	by Electrum may: (i) delay or deter a change of control of the Company; (ii) deprive shareholders of an opportunity to receive
	a premium for their shares as part of a sale of the Company; and (iii) affect the market price and liquidity of the shares. Without
	the consent of Electrum, we could be prevented from entering into transactions that are otherwise beneficial to us. The interests
	of Electrum may differ from or be adverse to the interests of our other shareholders. The effect of these rights and Electrum’s
	influence may impact the price that investors are willing to pay for securities. If Electrum sells a substantial number of shares
	in the public market, the market price of the shares could fall. The perception among the public that these sales will occur could
	also contribute to a decline in the market price of the shares.




	 




	Global
	climate change is an international concern, and could impact our ability to conduct future operations.




	 




	Global climate
	change is an international issue and receives an enormous amount of publicity. We would expect that the imposition of international
	treaties or U.S. or Canadian federal, state, provincial or local laws or regulations pertaining to mandatory reductions in energy
	consumption or emissions of greenhouse gasses could affect the feasibility of our mining projects and increase our operating costs.




	 




	Adverse
	publicity from non-governmental organizations could have a material adverse effect on us.




	 




	There is an increasing
	level of public concern relating to the effect of mining production on our surroundings, communities and environment. Non-governmental
	organizations (“NGOs”), some of which oppose resource development, are often vocal critics of the mining industry.
	While we seek to operate in a socially responsible manner, adverse publicity generated by such NGOs related to extractive industries,
	or our operations specifically, could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial condition or our relationship with
	the communities in which we operate.




	 






	27






	 






	We may fail
	to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as per the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act.





	 




	We are required
	to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of SOX. It requires an
	annual assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We may in the future fail
	to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented
	or amended from time to time, and we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective
	internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of SOX. Our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section
	404 of SOX on an ongoing, timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements,
	which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our Common Shares. In addition, any failure to
	implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results
	or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Future acquisitions of companies may provide us with challenges in implementing
	the required processes, procedures and controls in our acquired operations. Acquired companies may not have disclosure control
	and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by securities
	laws currently applicable to us.




	 




	Our
	business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance
	costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.




	 




	We are subject
	to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of United States and Canadian governmental and self-regulated organizations,
	including the SEC, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the NYSE-MKT, the TSX, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
	These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response
	to laws enacted by the United States Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. Our efforts to comply with new
	rules and regulations, including those promulgated under Dodd-Frank, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in,
	increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities
	to compliance activities.




	 




	Our
	Common Shares are subject to various factors that have historically made share prices volatile.




	 




	The market price
	of our Common Shares may be subject to large fluctuations, which may result in losses to investors. The market price of the Common
	Shares may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including: our operating performance and the performance
	of competitors and other similar companies; volatility in metal prices; the arrival or departure of key personnel; the number
	of Common Shares to be publicly traded after an offering; the public’s reaction to our press releases, material change reports,
	other public announcements and our filings with the various securities regulatory authorities; changes in earnings estimates or
	recommendations by research analysts who track the Common Shares or the shares of other companies in the resource sector; changes
	in general economic and/or political conditions; acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors;
	and the factors listed under the heading “

	Cautionary


	Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.

	”




	 




	The market price
	of the Common Shares may be affected by many other variables which are not directly related to our success and are, therefore,
	not within our control, including other developments that affect the market for all resource sector securities, the breadth of
	the public market for the Common Shares and the attractiveness of alternative investments.




	 




	We
	do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.




	 




	We have not declared
	or paid any dividends on our Common Shares. Our current business plan requires that for the foreseeable future, any future earnings
	be reinvested to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on the Common Shares
	in the foreseeable future. We will not declare or pay any dividends until such time as our cash flow exceeds our capital requirements
	and will depend upon, among other things, conditions then existing including earnings, financial condition, restrictions in financing
	arrangements, business opportunities and conditions and other factors, or our Board determines that our shareholders could make
	better use of the cash.






	28






	 





	 




	We
	may be a “passive foreign investment company” in future periods, which may have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences
	for U.S. shareholders.




	 




	U.S. investors
	in the Company should be aware that we believe we were not a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for the years
	ending November 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016 but may be a PFIC in future tax years. If we are a PFIC for any year during a U.S. Holder’s
	(as defined below under

	Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations – U.S. Holders

	”) holding period, then
	such U.S. Holder generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of Common Shares and any so-called “excess
	distribution” received on its Common Shares as ordinary income, and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such gain
	or distributions, unless the shareholder makes a timely and effective “QEF Election” or a “Mark-to-Market Election”
	(each as defined below under “

	Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations – Default PFIC Rules under Section
	1291 of the Code

	”). A U.S. Holder who makes a QEF Election generally must report on a current basis its share of our
	net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which we are a PFIC, whether or not we distribute any amounts to our shareholders.
	A U.S. Holder who makes the Mark-to-Market Election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair
	market value of the Common Shares over the U.S. Holder’s tax basis therein. This paragraph is qualified in its entirety
	by the discussion below the heading “

	Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations

	.” Each U.S. shareholder
	should consult its own tax advisor regarding the PFIC rules and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership,
	and disposition of Common Shares.

	Arctic
	Project - Property Description and Location




	 




	The Arctic Project
	is located in the Ambler mining district of the southern Brooks Range, in the Northwest Arctic Borough (“NWAB”) of
	Alaska. The Arctic Project is located 260 km east of the town of Kotzebue, 30 km north of the village of Kobuk, 260 km west
	of the Dalton Highway, an all-weather state maintained public road, at geographic coordinates N67.17° latitude and W156.38°
	longitude (Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) North American Datum (NAD) 83, Zone 4 coordinates 7453080N, 613110E). The current
	size of the Ambler lands is approximately 75 km long x 6 km wide and comprises a total of 45,348 ha.






	29






	 





	 




	The Ambler lands
	comprise 45,348 ha of State of Alaska mining claims and US Federal patented mining claims in the Kotzebue Recording District.
	The Ambler land tenure consists of 1,358 contiguous claims, including 870 40-acre State claims, 481 160-acre State claims, 5 State
	claims ranging from 2-acre to 8-acre, and two Federal patented claims comprising 110 ha held in the name of NovaCopper US Inc.
	The Arctic Project is located near the southern edge of the centre of the claim block. The Federal patented claim corners were
	located by the US Geological Survey. There is no expiration date or labor requirement on the Federal patented claims. Rent for
	each State claim is paid annually to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (“ADNR”). An Annual Labor Statement
	must be submitted annually to maintain the State claims in good standing.




	 




	In 1971, the US
	Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which settled land and financial claims made by the Alaska Natives and
	provided for the establishment of 13 regional corporations to administer those claims. These are known as the Alaska Native Regional
	Corporations. One of these 13 regional corporations is NANA. ANCSA Lands controlled by NANA bound the southern border of the property
	claim block. National Park lands are within 25 km of the northern property border.

	There are no known
	environmental liabilities due to previous operators or from our ongoing exploration activities at the Arctic Project. There has
	been no mine development or production on the Ambler lands.




	 




	Multiple permits
	are required during the exploration phase of the Arctic Project. Permits are issued from Federal, State, and Regional agencies,
	including: the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the US Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”), the
	Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (“ADEC”), the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (“ADF&G”),
	the ADNR, and the NWAB. The State of Alaska permit for exploration on the Arctic Project, the Annual Hardrock Exploration Activity
	(“AHEA”) Permit, is obtained and renewed every five years through the ADNR – Division of Mining, Land and Water.
	Trilogy holds an AHEA exploration permit in good standing with the Alaska DNR. The Arctic Project is within the NWAB thus requiring
	a Title 9 Miscellaneous Land Use permit for mineral exploration, fuel storage, gravel extraction, and the operation of a landfill.
	NovaGold held these permits in good standing during the 2004 to 2008 seasons and renewed the permits for the 2010 exploration
	season to 2015. The Bornite Camp, Bornite Landfill, and Dahl Creek Camp are permitted by the ADEC.




	 




	A number of statutory
	reports and payments are required to maintain the claims in good standing on an annual basis. As the Arctic Project progresses,
	additional permits for environmental baseline and detailed engineering studies will be necessary at federal, state, and local
	levels.




	 




	Arctic
	Project - Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography




	 




	Accessibility is
	one of the most significant challenges of developing the Arctic Project. There is no developed surface access to the Ambler mining
	district.




	 






	31






	 





	 




	Primary access
	to the Arctic Project is by air, using both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. There are four well maintained, approximately
	1,500 m-long gravel airstrips located near the Arctic Project, capable of accommodating charter fixed wing aircraft. These
	airstrips are located 66 km west at Ambler, 46 km southwest at Shungnak, 36 km southwest at Kobuk, and 32 km
	southwest at Dahl Creek. There is daily commercial air service from Kotzebue to the village of Kobuk, the closest community to
	the Arctic Project. During the summer months, the Dahl Creek Camp airstrip is suitable for larger aircraft, such as C-130 and
	DC-6. In addition to the four 1,500 m airstrips, there is a 700 m airstrip located at the Bornite Camp, approximately
	25 km southwest of the Arctic Deposit, and a 400 m airstrip located approximately 10 km southwest of the Arctic
	Deposit. The airstrip at Bornite is suited to smaller aircraft, which support the camp with personnel and supplies. An upgraded
	one-lane gravel road suitable for vehicles or construction equipment links the Bornite Camp to the Dahl Creek airstrip and camp
	southwest of the Arctic Deposit.




	 




	The climate in
	the region is typical of a sub-arctic environment. Exploration is generally conducted from late May until late September. Weather
	conditions on the Ambler lands can vary significantly from year to year and can change suddenly. During the summer exploration
	season, average maximum temperatures range from 10°C to 20°C, while average lows range from -2°C to 7°C. By early
	October, unpredictable weather limits regular helicopter travel to the Arctic Project. During winter months, the Arctic Project
	can be accessed by snow machine, track vehicle, or fixed wing aircraft. Winter temperatures are routinely below -25°C and
	can exceed -50°C. Annual precipitation in the region averages at 395 mm with the most rainfall occurring from June through
	September, and the most snowfall occurring from November through January.




	 




	The Arctic Project
	is located along the south slope of the Brooks Range, which separates the Arctic region from the interior of Alaska. Nearby surface
	waters include Subarctic Creek, the Shungnak and Kogoluktuk Rivers, the Kobuk River, and numerous small lakes. The Arctic Project
	is located at the eastern end of Subarctic Creek, a tributary of the Shungnak River to the west, along a ridge between Subarctic
	Creek and the Kogoluktuk River Valley. The property area is marked by steep and rugged terrain with high topographic relief. Elevations
	range from 30 masl along the Kobuk River to 1,180 masl on a peak immediately north of the Arctic Project area. The divide
	between the Shungnak and Kogoluktuk Rivers in the Ambler Lowlands is approximately 220 masl. The Kobuk Valley is located
	at the transition between boreal forest and Arctic tundra. Spruce, birch, and poplar are found in portions of the valley, with
	a ground cover of lichens (reindeer moss). Willow and alder thickets and isolated cottonwoods follow drainages, and alpine tundra
	is found at higher elevations. Tussock tundra and low, heath-type vegetation covers most of the valley floor. Intermittent permafrost
	exists on the Arctic Project.




	 




	Wildlife in the
	area includes caribou, moose, Dall sheep, bears (grizzly and black), wolves, wolverines, coyotes, and foxes. Fish species include
	salmon, sheefish, arctic char, and arctic grayling. The Kobuk River, which briefly enters the UKMP lands on its southwest corner,
	is a significant salmon spawning river. Subarctic Creek, which does not contain anadromous fish, drains into the Shungnak River,
	which drains into the Kobuk River. The caribou on the property belong to the Western Arctic herd that migrates twice a year –
	south in August, from their summer range north of the Brooks Range, and north in March from their winter range along the Buckland
	River.




	 




	Currently, the
	Arctic Project does not have access to Alaska power and transportation infrastructure. Beginning in 2009, the Arctic Project has
	been the focus of the Ambler Mining District Access Corridor study.




	 




	The Arctic Deposit
	proposed access road branches off from the proposed AMDIAP, formerly known as the Ambler Mining District Access Road or AMDIAR,
	and ends at the Arctic Deposit. Figure 3 shows the overall road location plan showing the relationship of the proposed access
	road to the proposed Brooks East corridor which eventually connects to the existing Dalton Highway 320 km from the access
	road intersection. The proposed access road is 17 km long from the AMDIAP corridor to the Arctic Project site.

	Proposed Access to the Arctic Project Site

	The proposed Arctic
	Project mine site infrastructure is spread over a distance of approximately 6 km within the upper reaches of the Sub-Arctic Creek
	Valley. The proposed development for the Arctic Project consists of the following major infrastructure: roads and an airstrip,
	mill buildings and related services facilities including maintenance and truck shops, assay lab, water supply and distribution,
	waste management, fuel storage, on site explosive storage, power supply, tailings storage facility (“TSF”) and
	water management, water treatment plant, construction and permanent camp accommodation, waste rock storage facilities, and communication
	infrastructure.




	 




	The proposed mine-site
	infrastructure has been located to take advantage of local topography, minimize pumping requirements from the mill building to
	the TSF, minimize environmental impacts to Sub-Arctic Creek, minimize snow avalanche mitigation requirements, and to reduce the
	haul distance from the pit to the primary crusher and TSF.




	 




	The proposed location
	for an airstrip sufficient to support project activities is located in the valley approximately 21 km from the Arctic Project
	site. Geotechnical data is not available for the site but it is assumed that the facility will require permafrost protection to
	ensure year round operations. The proposed airstrip will operate as a private aerodrome and prior permission will be required
	for all aircraft utilizing the site. The gravel airstrip will be approximately 1,524 meters long and capable of landing a Dash
	8 – Q400/Hercules C130.




	 




	The Arctic Project
	will require power of 15 MW of peak load for 10,000 t/d operation demand. It is proposed that power will be generated
	by five self-contained 3.6 MW prime diesel generators. Four units will be in service with the fifth unit reserved for maintenance.
	Heat will be recovered from the generators and used to heat the mill, camp and related facilities.




	 




	Arctic
	Project - History




	 




	During the 1940’s
	and 1950’s Bear Creek Mining Corporation (“BCMC”), an exploration subsidiary of Kennecott, conducted regional
	reconnaissance exploration in the Cosmos Hills and the southern Brooks Range. Stream silt sampling in 1963 by BCMC revealed a
	significant copper anomaly in Arctic Creek roughly 17 km northeast of the previously identified Bornite deposit. The area
	was subsequently staked and, in 1967, eight core holes were drilled at the Arctic Deposit yielding impressive massive sulphide
	intercepts over an almost 500-m strike length. BCMC conducted intensive exploration on the property until 1977 and then intermittently
	through 1998. No drilling or additional exploration was conducted on the Arctic Project between 1998 and 2004.

	Arctic
	Project - Historical Metallurgical Testwork




	 




	Metallurgical studies
	during the Kennecott era included: two initial mineralogical studies undertaken by the Kennecott Research Center (“KRC”)
	to evaluate and identify the potential beneficiation or metallurgical treatment of concentrates of the samples from the deposit
	and a subsequent 1999 Lakefield Research Ltd. (Lakefield) metallurgical test program to confirm and improve upon the results from
	the 1970s KRC test work program. In 2012, Trilogy contracted SGS to conduct an extensive metallurgical program in support of the
	Artic PEA, the results of which are described and summarized below under the heading “

	Arctic Project – Metallurgical
	Testing

	”.




	 




	Arctic
	Project - Historical Geophysics




	 




	Prior to 1998,
	Kennecott conducted a series of geophysical surveys which are poorly documented or are unavailable to Trilogy. In March 1998,
	Kennecott initiated an extensive helicopter-supported airborne electromagnetic (“EM”) and magnetic survey covering
	the entire VMS belt, including the Arctic Deposit. Kennecott identified eight EM anomalies which were deemed to have significant
	potential for mineralization and followed-up with additional gravity lines and/or Controlled Source Audio-frequency Magneto-Telluric
	(“CSAMT”) lines during 1998. Kennecott conducted no further geophysical field exploration in the district after 1998.




	 




	Arctic
	Project - Historical Drilling




	 




	Between 1967 and
	July 1985, Kennecott (BCMC) completed 86 holes (including 14 large diameter metallurgical test holes) totalling 16,080 m.
	In 1998, Kennecott drilled an additional 6 core holes totalling 1,492 m to test for: 1) extensions of the known Arctic resource;
	2) grade and thickness continuity at Arctic; and 3) a nearby airborne geophysical anomaly. Drilling for all BCMC/Kennecott campaigns
	in the Arctic Deposit area (1966 to 1998) totals 92 core holes for a combined 17,572 m.




	 




	No drilling was
	performed on the project between 1999 and 2003. NovaGold took control of the project in 2004.




	 




	Arctic
	Project - Historical Geochemistry




	 




	Historic geochemistry
	for the district, compiled in the 1998 Kennecott database, includes 2,255 soil samples, 922 stream silt samples, 363 rock samples,
	and 37 panned concentrate samples. Data has been sourced from several companies including Kennecott, Sunshine Mining, Resource
	Associates of Alaska, and NANA. Sourcing of much of the data had been poorly documented in the database. During 1998, Kennecott
	renewed its effort in the district, and, as a follow-up to the 1998 EM survey, undertook directed soil and rock chip sampling
	in and around EM anomalies generated in the geophysical targeting effort. During this period Kennecott collected 962 soils and
	107 rocks and for the first time used extensive multi-element inductively coupled plasma (“ICP”) analysis.




	 




	Arctic
	Project - Geologic Setting




	 




	Regional
	Geology




	 




	The Ambler mining
	district occurs along the southern margin of Brooks Range within an east-west trending zone of Devonian to Jurassic age submarine
	volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The district covers both: 1) VMS-like deposits and prospects hosted in the Devonian age Ambler
	Sequence (or Ambler Schist belt), a group of metamorphosed bimodal volcanic rocks with interbedded tuffaceous, graphitic and calcareous
	volcaniclastic metasediments; and 2) epigenetic carbonate-hosted copper deposits occurring in Devonian age carbonate and
	phyllitic rocks of the Bornite Carbonate Sequence. The Ambler Sequence occurs in the upper part of the Anirak Schist, the thickest
	member of the Schist belt or Coldfoot subterrane. VMS-like stratabound mineralization can be found along the entire 110 km
	strike length of the district. Immediately south of the Schist belt in the Cosmos Hills, a time equivalent section of the Anirak
	Schist includes the approximately 1 km thick Bornite Carbonate Sequence. Mineralization of both the VMS-like deposits of the Schist
	belt and the carbonate-hosted deposits of the Cosmos Hills has been dated at 375 to 387 Ma.




	 




	In addition, the
	Ambler mining district is characterized by increasing metamorphic grade north perpendicular to the strike of the east-west trending
	units. The district shows isoclinal folding in the northern portion and thrust faulting to south (Schmidt 1983). The Devonian
	to Mississippian age Angayucham basalt and the Triassic to Jurassic age mafic volcanic rocks are in low-angle over thrust contact
	with various units of the Ambler Schist belt and Bornite Carbonate Sequence along the northern edge of the Ambler Lowlands.




	 






	34






	 





	 




	Local/Property
	Geology




	 




	Rocks that form
	the Ambler Sequence consist of a lithologically diverse sequence of lower Paleozoic Devonian age carbonate and siliciclastic strata
	with interlayered mafic lava flows and sills and felsic tuffs. The clastic strata, derived from terrigenous continental and volcanic
	sources, were deposited primarily by mass-gravity flow into the sub-wavebase environment of an extending marginal basin.




	 




	Though the Ambler
	Sequence is exposed over 110 km of strike length, descriptions and comments herein will refer to an area between the Kogoluktuk
	River on the east and the Shungnak River on the west where we have focused the majority of our exploration efforts over the last
	decade.




	 




	The local base
	of the Ambler Sequence consists of variably metamorphosed carbonates historically referred to as the Gnurgle Gneiss. We interpret
	these strata as calc-turbidites, perhaps deposited in a sub-wavebase environment adjacent to a carbonate bank. Calcareous schists
	overlie the Gnurgle Gneiss and host sporadically distributed mafic sills and pillowed lavas. These fine-grained clastic strata
	indicate a progressively quieter depositional environment up section, and the presence of pillowed lavas indicates a rifting,
	basinal environment.




	 




	Overlying these
	basal carbonates and pillowed basalts is a section of predominantly fine-grained carbonaceous siliciclastic rocks which host a
	significant portion of the mineralization in the district including the Arctic Deposit. This quiescent section indicates further
	isolation from a terrigenous source terrain.




	 




	The section above
	the Arctic Deposit host stratigraphy contains voluminous reworked silicic volcanic strata with the Button Schist at its base.
	The Button Schist is a regionally continuous and distinctive albite porphyroblastic unit that serves as an excellent marker above
	the main mineralized stratigraphy. The paucity of volcanically derived strata below the Arctic Deposit host section and abundance
	above indicates that the basin and surrounding hinterlands underwent major tectonic reorganization during deposition of the Arctic
	Deposit section. Greywacke sands that we interpret as channeled high-energy turbidites occur throughout the section but concentrate
	high in the local stratigraphy.




	 




	Several rock units
	show substantial change in thickness and distribution in the vicinity of the Arctic Deposit that may have resulted from the basin
	architecture existing at the time of deposition. Between the Arctic Ridge, geographically above the Arctic Deposit, and the Riley
	Ridge to the west, several significant differences have been documented including: 1) the Gnurgle Gneiss, which is thickest in
	exposures along the northern extension of Arctic Ridge and appears to thin to the west; 2) mafic lavas and sills which thicken
	from east to west; they show thick occurrences in upper Subarctic Creek and to the west, but are sparsely distributed to the east;
	3) the quartzite section, which within and above the Arctic sulphide horizon does not occur in abundance east of Arctic Ridge;
	it is thicker and occurs voluminously to the west; 4) the Button Schist which thickens dramatically to the west from exposures
	on Arctic Ridge; exposures to the east are virtually nonexistent; and 5) Greywacke sands which do not exist east of Subarctic
	Creek but occur in abundance as massive, channeled accumulations to the west, centered on Riley Ridge.




	 




	These data are
	interpreted by us to define a generally north-northwest-trending depocentre through the central Ambler mining district. Diamictite
	occurrences described below in concert with these formational changes suggest that the depocentre had a fault-controlled eastern
	margin with the basin deepening to the west. This original basin architecture appears to have controlled mineralization of the
	sulphide systems at Ambler and Shungnak (Dead Creek), concentrating fluid flow along structures on the eastern basin margin.




	 




	In addition to
	the underlying pre-deformational structural framework of the district suggested by the stratigraphic thickening of various facies
	around the Arctic Deposit, the Ambler Sequence is deformed by two penetrative deformational events that significantly complicate
	the distribution and spatial arrangement of the local stratigraphy; as described below.




	 




	F1 Deformation:
	the earliest penetrative deformation event is associated with greenschist metamorphism and the development of regional schistosity.
	True isoclinal folds are developed and fold noses typically are thickened. The most notable F1 fold is the Arctic antiform that
	defines the upper and lower limbs of the Arctic Deposit. The fold closes along a north-northeast- trending fold axis roughly mimicking
	the trace of Subarctic Creek and opening to the east. Importantly, the overturned lower limb implies that the permissive stratigraphy
	should be repeated on a lower synformal isocline beneath the currently explored limbs and would connect with the permissive mineralized
	stratigraphy to the northwest at Shungnak (Dead Creek).




	 






	35






	 





	 




	F2 Deformation:
	the earlier F1 schistosity is in turn deformed by the F2 deformational event that resulted in the local development of an axial
	planar cleavage. The deformational event is well defined throughout the Schist belt and results in a series of south verging open
	to moderately overturned folds that define a series of east-west trending folds of similar vergence across the entire Schist belt
	stratigraphies. This event is likely temporarily related to the emplacement of the Devonian Angayucham volcanics, the obducted
	Jurassic ophiolites and Cretaceous sediments over the Schist belt stratigraphies. In addition to the earlier penetrative deformation
	events, a series of poorly defined non-penetrative deformation events, likely as a consequence of Cretaceous extension, are seen
	as a series of warps or arches across the district. The interplay between the complex local stratigraphy, the isoclinal F1 event,
	the overturned south verging F2 event and the series of post-penetrative deformational events makes district geological interpretation
	often extremely difficult at a local scale.




	 




	Recent work by
	us defines the Arctic Deposit as two or more discrete horizons of sulphide mineralization contained in a complexly deformed isoclinal
	fold with an upright upper limb and an overturned lower limb hosting the main mineral resources. Nearby drilling suggests a third
	limb, an upright lower limb, likely occurs beneath the currently explored stratigraphy

	.





	 




	Mineralization
	occurs as stratiform semi-massive sulphide (“SMS”) to massive sulphide (“MS”) beds within primarily graphitic
	chlorite schists and fine-grained quartz sandstones. The sulphide beds average four meters in thickness but vary from less
	than one meter up to as much as eighteen meters in thickness. The bulk of the mineralization is within six modelled zones lying
	along the upper and lower limbs of the Arctic isoclinal anticline. All of the zones are within an area of roughly 1 km

	2

	with mineralization extending to a depth of approximately 250 m below the surface. Mineralization characteristically
	varies from MS to SMS. Unlike more typical VMS deposits, mineralization is not characterized by steep metal zonation or massive
	pyritic zones. Mineralization is dominantly sheet-like zones of base metal sulphides with variable pyrite and only minor zonation
	usually on an extremely small scale. No stockworks or stringer zones in association with the mineralization have been observed.
	More importantly, the mineralization in general exhibits characteristics and textures common to replacement-style mineralization.
	Mineralization is predominately coarse-grained sulphides consisting mainly of chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite,
	arsenopyrite, pyrite and pyrrhotite. Trace amounts of electrum and enargite are also present. Gangue minerals associated with
	the mineralized horizons include quartz, barite, white mica, black chlorite, talc, calcite, dolomite and cymrite.




	 




	Talc and magnesium
	chlorite are the dominant alteration products associated with the sulphide-bearing horizons. Talc alteration grades downward and
	outward to mixed talc-magnesium chlorite with minor phlogopite, into zones of dominantly magnesium chlorite, then into mixed magnesium
	chlorite-phengite with outer phengite-albite zones of alteration. Thickness of alteration zones vary with stratigraphic interpretation,
	but tens of meters for the outer zones is likely, as seen in phengite-albite exposures on the east side of Arctic Ridge. Stratigraphically
	above the sulphide-bearing horizons significant muscovite as paragonite is developed and results in a marked shift in sodium/magnesium
	ratios across the sulphide bearing horizons. Of particular note are the barium (“Ba”) species including barite, cymrite
	(a high-pressure Ba phyllosilicate), and Ba-bearing muscovite, phlogopite and biotite. These species associated with both alteration
	and mineralization has also been strongly remobilized during metamorphism.




	 




	Historic interpretation
	of the genesis of the Ambler Schist belt deposits have called for a syngenetic VMS origin with steep thermal gradients in and
	around seafloor hydrothermal vents resulting in metal deposition due to the rapid cooling of chloride bound base metals. A variety
	of VMS types have been well documented in the literature (Franklin et al. 2005) with the Ambler Schist belt deposits most similar
	to deposits associated with a bimodal mafic dominant volcanism related to incipient rifting. The majority of field observations
	broadly support such a scenario at the Arctic Deposit and include: 1) the tectonic setting with Devonian volcanism in an evolving
	continental rift; 2) the geologic setting with bimodal volcanics including pillow basalts and limited felsic volcanic tuffs; 3)
	an alteration assemblage with well-defined magnesium-rich footwall alteration and sodium-rich hanging wall alteration; and 4) typical
	polymetallic base-metal mineralization with massive and semi-massive sulphides. Although the majority of field observations support
	a VMS genesis to the deposits of the Schist belt, a series of other observations and characteristics suggest a more direct genetic
	link with that of the carbonate-hosted Bornite Deposit in the Devonian Bornite Carbonate Sequence. Both deposit types have been
	dated at 375 to 387 Ma suggesting a clear temporal link.




	 




	The principal lithologic
	units captured in logging and mapping by us, in broad chronological order from oldest to youngest are as follows: greenstone,
	chlorite schist, talc schist, grey to black schists, metarhyolites, most notably the so-called button schist which serves as an
	important stratigraphic marker, quartz muscovite schists, diamictites and greywackes.

	Arctic
	Project - Exploration




	 




	NovaGold began
	exploration of the Arctic Deposit and surrounding lands of the Schist belt in 2004 after optioning the property from Kennecott.
	Previous exploration on the Arctic Project during Kennecott’s tenure is summarized in “

	Arctic Project – History”.

	Field exploration was largely conducted during the period 2004 to 2007 with associated engineering and characterization studies
	between 2008 and 2012. Table 2 summarizes the exploration work conducted by NovaGold and us during our tenure from 2004 to 2012.

	In 2013, we updated
	the mineralization models, representing massive and semi-massive VMS-style mineralization. Geometrically, the mineralization is
	confined to six lenticular mineralized zones concentrated along an isoclinal fold hinge. Five of the six SMS zones contain a core
	of MS material. For more details regarding length, width, depth and continuity together with a description of the type, character
	and distribution of the mineralization see

	Drilling at the
	Arctic Deposit has been ongoing since its initial discovery in 1965. Approximately 31,907 m of drilling in 135 drill holes
	have been completed at the deposit or on potential extensions in 23 campaigns spanning 45 years. All of the drill campaigns between
	1965 and 2012 have been run under the auspices of either: 1) Kennecott and its subsidiaries, or 2) NovaGold, our predecessor company.




	 




	We and our predecessor
	company NovaGold, have drilled 17,983 m in 59 different drill holes targeting the Arctic Deposit and several other prospects
	of the Ambler Schist belt. Table 3 summarizes all of the Trilogy/NovaGold tenure drilling on the property. Drilling conducted

	Over the Arctic
	Project’s history, a relatively limited number of drill companies have been used by Kennecott and Trilogy/NovaGold at the
	Arctic Deposit. During Kennecott’s tenure on the property, Sprague and Henwood, a Pennsylvania-based drilling company was
	the principal contractor. Sprague and Henwood utilized company manufactured drill rigs during their tenure on the property. Many
	of their rigs remain at the Bornite Deposit and constitute a historical inventory of 1950s and 1960s exploration artifacts. Tonto
	Drilling provided services to Kennecott during Kennecott’s short return to the district in the late 1990s. We and NovaGold
	have utilized Boart Longyear as our only contractor. The 2004 to 2012 Trilogy/NovaGold drill programs used a single skid-mounted
	LF-70 core rig, drilling HQ or NQ core. Wireframes were updated in 2013 to incorporate interpretation of all drill results to
	date and have been included in the resource estimate.




	 




	Arctic
	Project - Sampling Methodology and Analysis




	 




	The data for the
	Arctic Deposit resource was generated over three primary drilling campaigns: 1966 to 1986 when BCMC, a subsidiary of Kennecott
	Copper Corporation was the primary operator, 1998 when Kennecott Minerals resumed work after a long hiatus, and 2004 to 2012 with
	NovaGold and now us as the operators.




	 




	Sampling of drill
	core prior to 1998 by BCMC focused primarily on the mineralized zones; numerous intervals of weak to moderate mineralization were
	not sampled during this period. During the 1998 campaign, Kennecott did sample some broad zones of alteration and weak mineralization,
	but much of the unaltered and unmineralized drill core was left unsampled. Little documentation on historic sampling procedures
	is available.




	 




	Between 2004 and
	2006, NovaGold conducted a systematic drill core re-logging and re-sampling campaign of Kennecott and BCMC era drill holes AR-09
	to AR-74. NovaGold either took 1 to 2 m samples every 10 m, or sampled entire lengths of previously unsampled core within
	a minimum of 1 m and a maximum of 3 m intervals. The objective of the sampling was to generate a full ICP geochemistry
	dataset for the Arctic Deposit and ensure continuous sampling throughout the deposit. Sample preparation procedures for NovaGold
	era work are described below.

	All drill core
	was transported by helicopter in secure core “baskets” to either the Dahl Creek camp or the Bornite camp for logging
	and sampling. Sample intervals were determined by the geologist during the geological logging process. Sample intervals were labelled
	with white paper tags and butter (aluminum) tags which were stapled to the core box. Each tag had a unique number which corresponded
	to that sample interval. Sample intervals were determined by the geological relationships observed in the core and limited to
	a three meter maximum length and one meter minimum length. An attempt was made to terminate sample intervals at lithological and
	mineralization boundaries. Sampling was generally continuous from the top to the bottom of the drill hole. When the hole was in
	unmineralized rock, the sample length was generally three meters, whereas in mineralized units, the sample length was shortened
	to one to two meters. Geological and geotechnical parameters were recorded based on defined sample intervals and/or drill run
	intervals (defined by the placement of a wooden block at the end of a core run). Logged parameters were reviewed annually and
	slight modifications have been made between campaigns, but generally include rock type, mineral abundance, major structures, specific
	gravity (“SG”), point load testing, recovery and rock quality designation measurements. Drill logs were converted
	to a digital format and forwarded to the Database Manager, who imported them into the master database. Core was photographed and
	then brought into the saw shack where it was split in half by the rock saw, divided into sample intervals, and bagged by the core
	cutters. Not all drill core was oriented; however, core that had been oriented was identified to samplers by a line drawn down
	the core stick. If core was not competent, it was split by using a spoon to transfer half of the core into the sample bag. Once
	the core was sawed, half was sent to ALS Chemex Laboratories (“ALS Chemex”) in Vancouver for analysis and the other
	half was stored at the Dahl Creek camp, but since has been consolidated at the storage facility at the Bornite camp facilities
	or at our warehouse in Fairbanks. Shipment of core samples from the Dahl Creek camp occurred on a drill hole by drill hole basis.
	Rice bags, containing two to four poly-bagged core samples each, were marked and labelled with the ALS Chemex address, project
	and hole number, bag number, and sample numbers enclosed. Rice bags were secured with a pre-numbered plastic security tie and
	a twist wire tie and then assembled into sling loads for transport by chartered flights on a commercial airline to Fairbanks,
	where they were met by a contracted expeditor for delivery directly to the ALS Minerals preparation facility in Fairbanks. In
	addition to the core, control samples were inserted into the shipments at the approximate rate of one standard, one blank and
	one duplicate per 20 core samples:




	 








	·




	Standards:
	four standards were used at the Arctic Deposit. The core cutter inserted a sachet of
	the appropriate standard, as well as the sample tag, into the sample bag.










	·




	Blanks:
	were composed of an unmineralized landscape aggregate. The core cutter inserted about
	150 g of blank, as well as the sample tag, into the sample bag.










	·




	Duplicates:
	the assay laboratory split the sample and ran both splits. The core cutter inserted a
	sample tag into an empty sample bag.






	 




	Samples were logged
	into a tracking system on arrival at ALS Chemex, and weighed. Samples were then crushed, dried, and a 250 g split pulverized
	to greater than 85% passing 75 μm.




	 




	Gold assays were
	determined using fire analysis followed by an atomic absorption spectroscopy finish. The lower detection limit was 0.005 ppm
	gold; the upper limit was 1,000 ppm gold. An additional 34-element suite was assayed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic
	emission spectroscopy (“ICP-AES”) methodology, following nitric acid aqua regia digestion. The copper analyses were
	completed by atomic absorption (“AA”), following a triple acid digest.




	 




	The accreditations
	of Primary and Secondary assay laboratories used during the 1966 – 1986 campaigns are not known. ALS Analytical Lab (Fairbanks,
	Alaska) was the Primary assay lab between 1998 – present. ALS Chemex has attained International Organization for Standardization
	(“ISO”) 9001:2000 registration. In addition, the ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver is accredited to ISO 17025 by
	Standards Council of Canada for a number of specific test procedures including fire assay of gold by AA, ICP and gravimetric finish,
	multi-element ICP and AA assays for silver, copper, lead and zinc. Trilogy has no relationship with any assay labs.




	 




	During 2013, we
	conducted a 26% audit of the NovaGold era assay database fields: sample interval, Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, and Pb. This audit is documented
	in a series of memos. Our staff did not identify and/or correct any transcription and/or coding errors in the database prior to
	resource estimation. We also retained independent consultant Caroline Vallat, P.Geo. of GeoSpark Consulting Inc. to: 1) re-load
	100% of the historical assay certificates, 2) conduct a QA/QC review of paired historical assays and NovaGold era re-assays; 3)
	monitor an independent check assay program for the 2004 to 2008 and 2011 drill campaigns; and 4) generate QA/QC reports for the
	2004 to 2008 and 2011 drill campaigns.

	Arctic –
	Security of Samples






	 




	Security measures
	taken during historical Kennecott and BCMC programs are unknown to NovaGold or us. We are not aware of any reason to suspect that
	any of these samples have been tampered with. The 2004 to 2011 samples were either in the custody of NovaGold personnel, contractors
	or the assay laboratories at all times as discussed above, and the chain of custody of the samples is well documented.




	 




	Arctic
	Project - Mineral Resource Estimate




	 




	The mineral resource
	estimate was prepared by Tetra Tech with an effective date of the resource estimate as of July 30, 2013. Mineral Resources
	are classified in accordance with the 2010 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.




	 




	The mineral resource
	model prepared by Tetra Tech considers diamond drill holes drilled by different operators during the period 1965 to 2011. The
	majority of the assaying has been completed in recent years by us and our previous parent company NovaGold. The mineral resource
	for the Arctic Project is supported by 43 core holes (approximately 13,500 m) drilled by NovaGold and 92 core holes (approximately
	17,600 m) drilled by previous owners Kennecott, and/or a Kennecott subsidiary. The geological and assay database used to
	estimate the Arctic Project mineral resources have been reviewed and audited by Tetra Tech.




	 




	Leapfrog

	™

	software (version 2.5.1) was used to review and verify the resource estimation domains, prior to being imported into Isatis

	™

	software (version 2012.1) to prepare assay data for geostatistical analysis, variography, block model construction, metal
	grade estimation and mineral resource tabulation. Mineral Resources were estimated into five MS and six SMS lenses, and then combined
	for an overall grade for the mineralized portion of the 10 m by 10 m by 5 m block. Extreme lead and gold assays
	were capped prior to compositing. Ordinary kriging and inverse distance squared estimates were run, with ordinary kriging used
	for resource reporting and inverse distance squared used for validation. Search parameters were constrained within each mineralized
	domain and required an optimum number of 15 composites, minimum number of 5 composites, minimum number of 2 drill holes, and maximum
	search distance range of 200 m. In general, blocks categorized as Indicated were supported by at least two drill holes within
	a 75 m search radii, and blocks categorized as Inferred were supported by at least 2 drill holes within a 150 m search
	radii. Estimated resources for the Arctic Deposit are reported in the following Table 4 and Table 5.




	 




	The Arctic Project
	has no known reserves.




	 




	The PEA is preliminary
	in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations
	applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the estimates contained
	in the PEA will ever be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

	Arctic
	Project – Mining Operations




	 




	The
	Arctic Project is not currently in production; for contemplated exploration or development activities see below.




	 




	Arctic
	Project – Exploration and Development




	 




	As noted in the
	summary

	Arctic Project – Technical Report

	above, we engaged Tetra Tech to prepare a PEA for the Arctic Project. The
	following summary describes the main results and assumptions of the PEA not previously discussed above. See “

	Arctic Project
	– Current Activities

	” below for a description of the Company’s current and contemplated exploration.




	 




	The PEA is based
	on a conventional truck-and-shovel, open-pit mine design at a single pit. The mining schedule was developed based on a maximum
	mill capacity of 10,000 t/d. The Arctic Project’s total mine life is 13 years, including 1 year of pre-stripping followed
	by 12 years of production. The pit uses four pushbacks and a minimum mining width of 40 m. Over the 13-year life, the pit
	is producing 35.7 Mt of mineralized material and 299.4 Mt of waste rock. The life-of-mine (“LOM”) stripping
	ratio is 8.39 and the stripping ratio excluding the pre-stripping waste rock is 7.94. The mining schedule does not currently consider
	a low-grade stockpiling option but this can be assessed in more detail in future studies.




	 






	41






	 






	 






	Mineral Processing
	and Metallurgical Testing





	 




	Since 1970, metallurgical
	test work has been conducted to determine the flotation response of various samples extracted from the Arctic Deposit. In general,
	the samples tested produced similar metallurgical performances. In 2012, SGS Mineral Services (“SGS”) conducted a
	metallurgical test program to further study metallurgical responses of the samples produced from Zones 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the Arctic
	Deposit. The flotation test procedures used talc pre-flotation, conventional copper-lead bulk flotation and zinc flotation, followed
	by copper and lead separation. In general, the 2012 test results indicated that the samples responded well to the flowsheet tested.
	Below is a summary of average results of the locked cycle tests (without copper and lead separation).




	 








	·




	The
	copper recoveries to the bulk copper-lead concentrates ranged from 89 to 93% excluding
	the Zone 1 & 2 composite which produced a copper recovery of approximately 84%; the
	copper grades of the bulk concentrates were 24 to 28%.






	 








	·




	Approximately
	92 to 94% of the lead was recovered to the bulk copper-lead concentrates containing 9
	to 13% lead.






	 








	·




	The
	zinc recovery was 84.2% from Composite Zone 1 & 2, 93.0% from Composite Zone 3 and
	90.5% from Composite Zone 5. On average, the zinc grades of the concentrates produced
	were higher than 55%, excluding the concentrate generated from Composite Zone 1 &
	2, which contained only 44.5% zinc.






	 








	·




	Gold
	and silver were predominantly recovered into the bulk copper-lead concentrates. Gold
	recoveries to this concentrate ranged from 65 to 80%, and silver recoveries ranged from
	80 to 86%.






	 




	Using an open circuit
	procedure, the copper and lead separation tests on the bulk copper-lead concentrate produced from the locked cycle tests generated
	reasonable copper and lead separation. The copper concentrates produced contained approximately 28 to 31% copper, while the grades
	of the lead concentrates were in the range of 41% to 67% lead. Also, it appears that most of the gold reported to the copper concentrate
	and on average the silver was equally recovered into the copper and lead concentrates.




	 




	The 2012 grindability
	test results showed that the Bond ball millwork index tests ranged from 6.5 to 11 kWh/t and abrasion index tests fluctuated
	from 0.017 to 0.072 g for the mineralized samples. The data indicates that the samples are neither resistant nor abrasive
	to ball mill grinding. The materials are considered to be soft or very soft in terms of grinding requirements.





	 






	Recovery Methods





	 




	A 10,000 t/d
	process plant has been designed to process the massive and semi-massive sulphide mineralization of the Arctic property. The main
	economic elements found in the deposit are copper, zinc, lead, and associated gold and silver. The process plant will operate
	two twelve hour shifts per day, 365 days per year with an overall plant availability of 92%. The process plant will produce
	three concentrates: 1) copper concentrate, 2) zinc concentrate, and 3) lead concentrate. Gold and silver are expected to be payable
	at a smelter and are recovered in both the copper and lead concentrates. The process plant feed will be supplied from the Arctic
	open pit mine.




	 




	The mill feed will
	be hauled from the open pit to a primary crushing facility where the material will be crushed by a jaw crusher to a particle size
	of 80% passing 125 mm.




	 




	The crushed material
	will be ground by two stages of grinding, consisting of one SAG mill and one ball mill in closed circuit with hydrocyclones (SAB
	circuit). The hydrocyclone overflow with a grind size of approximately 80% passing 70 µm will first undergo pre-talc
	flotation, and then be processed by conventional bulk flotation (to recover copper, lead, and associated gold and silver), followed
	by zinc flotation. The rougher bulk concentrate will be cleaned and followed by copper and lead separation to produce a lead concentrate
	and a copper concentrate. The final tailings from the zinc flotation circuit will be pumped to the TSF. Copper, lead, and zinc
	concentrates will be thickened and pressure-filtered before being transported by truck to a port and shipped to smelters.




	 




	The LOM average
	mill feed is expected to contain 2.28% copper, 0.53% lead, 3.13% zinc, 0.5 g/t gold, and 37 g/t silver. According to the
	mine plan developed for the PEA study and metallurgical test results, the LOM average metal recoveries and concentrate grades
	are projected below:




	 








	·




	copper
	concentrate recovery: 87.1% copper; 57.9% gold; 40.2% silver; copper grade: 29%





	 





	42






	 





	 








	·




	lead
	concentrate recovery: 74.0% lead; 6.8% gold; 40.2% silver; lead grade: 50%






	 








	·




	zinc
	concentrate recovery: 86.8% zinc; zinc grade: 56%.







	 






	Tailings and
	Storage Facility





	 




	The co-disposal
	TSF will be a fully lined facility consisting of rockfill embankment constructed across the Sub-Arctic Creek drainage, creating
	an impoundment that will extend up the drainage. The rockfill embankment will be constructed to an ultimate crest elevation of
	655 masl with the embankment being raised in stages to minimize the initial capital construction cost. During operations,
	potential acid generating (“PAG”) waste rock will be placed at the bottom and sides of the basin forming layers with
	consecutive disposal on tailings that will be filling the voids. The tailings has the potential to generate acid and, therefore,
	the tailings and the PAG waste rock will be placed under water and remain permanently submerged in order to reduce the potential
	for acid generation. Additional studies will be required to determine the most suitable method of co-disposal and potential requirements
	for acid rock drainage (“ARD”) management and mitigation programs will need to be part of the design of the TSF.




	 




	The TSF will be
	required to contain 110.5 Mm

	3

	total over the 12-year LOM, with 23.8 Mm

	3

	to accommodate the tailings
	at an assumed stored dry density of 1.5 t/m

	3

	and 86.7 Mm

	3

	of PAG waste rock at an assumed stored
	dry density of 1.9 t/m

	3

	. The TSF will be sited as a staged rockfill embankment with an upstream geomembrane liner.
	The starter embankment will have a crest elevation of 560 m and impound 1 year of mining production, which is approximately
	670,000 m

	3

	of tailings and 12.3 Mm

	3

	of waste rock.




	 




	Arctic
	Project - Environmental Considerations




	 




	Environmental baseline
	data collection was initiated in 2007, including surface water quality sampling, wetlands mapping, stream flow monitoring, aquatic
	life surveys, subsistence, meteorological monitoring, and acid base accounting sampling. Additional baseline environmental data
	in the Ambler Lowlands, the Subarctic Creek drainage, the Shungnak River drainage and downstream receiving environments will be
	required to support future mine design, development of an environmental impact statement, permitting, construction and operations.




	 




	The Arctic Project
	has the potential to significantly improve work opportunities for local and regional residents. In October 2011, we signed an
	agreement with NANA which in addition to consolidating landholdings in the Ambler district has language establishing native hiring
	preferences and preferential use of NANA subsidiaries for contract work. Furthermore, the agreement formalized an Oversight Committee,
	with equal representation from NANA and us, to regularly review project plans and activities. In addition, a Subsistence Subcommittee
	has been formed to protect subsistence and the Iñupiaq way of life and a Workforce Development Subcommittee is also in
	place to address current and future employment needs. We meet monthly, during summer months, with the residents of Kobuk, Shungnak
	and Ambler, the three villages closest to the project area. We also meet annually with eight other NANA region villages including
	Noatak, Kivalina, Kotzebue, Kiana, Deering, Buckland, Selawik and Noorvik, for the purpose of updating residents on project plans
	and fielding their questions and concerns. We have also developed a good working relationship with the NWAB government.




	 




	The Arctic Project
	will be subject to a mine permitting process which will include compliance with the

	National Environmental Policy Act

	and
	will require a number of major mine permits from state and federal agencies as well as a significant number of minor permits.
	Although a number of federal conservation units are located in the general vicinity of the Arctic Project, including but not limited
	to the Gates of the Arctic National Parks, Kobuk Preserve, Selawik National Wildlife Refuge, and Kobuk Valley and Selawik Wilderness
	areas, there presence does not change the permitting process nor add to the number of permits required for the Arctic Project.




	 




	We will be required
	to develop a formal project description and detailed reclamation and closure plan to support a successful permit application strategy.
	The mine plan will embrace the concept of “design for closure”. In order to reduce any lasting risk of environmental
	impacts, the plan will minimize surface disturbances during operations and promote long-term stability of the site after closure.




	 




	No assurance can
	be given that new laws and regulations will not be enacted or that existing laws and regulations will not be applied in a manner
	that could limit or curtail the Arctic Project. Amendments to current laws, regulations, licenses and permits governing operations
	and activities of mining companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on the Arctic
	Project and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs, or reduction in levels of production, or abandonment,
	or delays in the development of the business.

	Arctic
	Project - Current Activities




	 




	2015




	 




	The focus of work
	on the Arctic Project in 2015 was drilling, surficial field investigations and desktop studies to support pre-feasibility. Trilogy
	completed fourteen diamond drill holes for a total of 3,056 m of core; including twelve in-fill drill holes, representing 2,425
	m, designed to evaluate vertical and lateral continuity of the high-grade polymetallic copper, gold, silver, lead and zinc mineralization,
	and support upgrading of inferred resources to measured and indicated resource classification within the area of the proposed
	Arctic open-pit as outlined in the PEA, and two drill holes, representing 631 m, specifically targeting geotechnical and hydrogeological
	information. Based on a cut-off grade of 1.0% copper all fourteen drill holes intersected significant intervals; defined as a
	minimum of 1.0 meter copper interval with average grade >0.7% copper.




	 




	The 2015 drill
	program, sampling protocol and data verification were managed and overseen by qualified persons employed by Trilogy. The twelve
	in-fill diamond drill holes were drilled at NQ diameter drill core and the two geotechnical drill holes were drilled at HQ diameter
	drill core by Boart Longyear of South Jordan, Utah. Samples in mineralized core were collected using a 0.3-meter minimum length,
	2.0-meter maximum length and 0.9-meter average sample length. Samples in un-mineralized core were collected using 2.0-meter minimum
	length, 10-meter maximum length and 4-meter average sample length. Drill core recovery averaged 94% without overburden. Three
	quality control samples (one blank, one standard and one duplicate) were inserted into each batch of 20 samples. The drill core
	was either sawn or shipped as whole core, with samples sent to ALS Minerals, Fairbanks, Alaska for sample preparation and the
	sample pulps forwarded to ALS’s North Vancouver facility for analysis. ALS Minerals in North Vancouver, B.C., Canada, is
	a facility certified as ISO 9001:2008 and accredited to ISO / IEC 17025:2005 from the Standards Council of Canada.




	 




	In addition to
	the drill program, Trilogy contracted SRK Consulting of Vancouver, Canada (SRK) to conduct a dedicated field investigation comprised
	of drill logging, mapping, laboratory test work and downhole installations. A summary report detailing a gap analysis, desktop
	study findings and field investigation recommendations was issued prior to the drill program. Two dual purpose drill holes were
	completed for geotechnical (soil and rock) and hydrogeological data acquisition. Additionally, SRK hydrogeologists re-visited
	previously installed vibrating wire piezometers to ensure data loggers were operational and to download pore pressure measurement
	data. A civil geotechnical site visit was conducted to investigate surface conditions and provide comment on potential infrastructure
	and waste management facilities layout. Furthermore, structural mapping of exposed rock faces along the Arctic ridge along with
	downhole televiewer and structural logging of newly acquired drill core were consolidated with prior work to support a 3D structural
	model.




	 




	Under the guidance
	of SRK, Trilogy initiated acid-base-accounting kinetic test work at Arctic in 2015; both on-site barrel testing and parallel laboratory
	humidity cells. In addition, Trilogy collected samples from the 2015 drill program to increase static testing coverage over the
	Arctic deposit.




	 




	Environmental baseline
	data collection continued in 2015, including 34,000 acres of wetlands delineation within the project area, which was completed
	by WHPacific of Anchorage, Alaska. Seventy percent of a LiDAR survey over the UKMP was completed by WHPacific and Quantum Spatial
	before weather conditions became unfavorable.




	 




	2016




	 




	Site investigation
	activities continued at the UKMP Projects in 2016 and were mainly focused on advancing the Arctic project towards pre-feasibility.
	We completed thirteen diamond drill holes for a total of 3,058 meters of core. The 2016 drill program was designed to collect
	data for geotechnical, hydrological, waste rock characterization and metallurgical studies as well as further resource definition.




	 




	Three drill holes
	representing 822 meters drilled were designed to collect geotechnical and hydrological data within the proposed Arctic open-pit.
	Data collected from the geotechnical/hydrological drill program and outcrop/seeps mapping was used to update a 3D structure model,
	rock mass model, and hydrogeology model and these results have been integrated into a combined geotechnical model that will be
	used for characterization of geotechnical domains and slope stability evaluation in a future pre-feasibility study.




	 






	44






	 





	 




	Four drill holes
	representing 1,030 meters drilled were designed to collect metallurgical samples, specifically targeting material within the initial
	production years of the Arctic open-pit. A metallurgical test work program is currently underway and expected to be complete in
	Q1-2017.




	 




	Six drill holes
	representing 1,206 meters drilled were designed to evaluate vertical and lateral continuity of the high grade polymetallic copper,
	gold, silver, lead, and zinc mineralization, and support upgrading of Inferred resources to Measured and Indicated resource classification
	within the area of the proposed Arctic open-pit. We are pleased to announce that all six infill holes encountered mineralized
	intervals consistent with previous drilling conducted within the resource area on the property. Data collected from the drill
	program was used to update the 3D geology model. The updated geology domains and drill data will be incorporated into an updated
	resource estimate that will support a future pre-feasibility study.




	 




	The drill program,
	sampling protocol and data verification were managed and overseen by qualified persons employed by Trilogy Metals. Thirteen diamond
	drill holes were drilled at HQ and NQ diameter drill core by Boart Longyear of South Jordan, Utah. Samples in mineralized core
	were collected using a 0.2-meter minimum length, 5.0-meter maximum length and 1.4-meter average sample length. Samples in un-mineralized
	core were collected using 0.2-meter minimum length, 5.0-meter maximum length and 3.2-meter average sample length. Drill core recovery
	averaged 94% with overburden. Three quality control samples (one blank, one standard and one duplicate) were inserted into each
	batch of 20 samples. The drill core was either sawn or shipped as whole core, with samples sent to ALS Minerals, Fairbanks, Alaska
	for sample preparation and the sample pulps forwarded to ALS's North Vancouver facility for analysis. ALS Minerals in North Vancouver,
	B.C., Canada, is a facility certified as ISO 9001:2008 and accredited to ISO / IEC 17025:2005 from the Standards Council of Canada.




	 




	In addition to
	the drill program, we conducted an aquatics survey, avian survey, habitat survey, archaeological survey, and wetlands delineation
	survey, and continued ongoing baseline environmental data collection in 2016.




	 




	An aquatics survey
	of rivers and creeks over the UKMP Projects included identification of fish species present and tissues metals testing. An avian
	survey over the UKMP Projects was conducted in May to identify bird nest locations, with a follow-up survey in July to measure
	fledging success. A habitat survey was completed in conjunction with the wetlands survey and will be used to inform future biological
	surveys. Approximately 2,400 acres were surveyed for archaeological resources in or around the potential Arctic open-pit and facilities
	locations. Approximately 2,900 acres of wetlands were delineated using techniques approved by the Army Corps of Engineers.




	 




	On-going baseline
	environmental data collection included maintenance of three hydrologic gauging stations and one meteorological station. Surface
	water quality samples were taken from sixteen surface water locations and analyzed for a full suite of parameters including total
	and dissolved metals.




	 




	We continue to
	advance the acid-base-accounting static and kinetic test work at Arctic. Continuous down-hole samples were collected from the
	2016 drill program to support static testing coverage over the Arctic deposit. On-site barrel sampling was successfully completed
	in the spring and fall of 2016 to support the kinetics program, and in August we achieved the 40-week milestone for the parallel
	laboratory humidity cells; maintenance and monitoring of all kinetic tests will continue into 2017.




	 




	The LiDAR survey
	that was incomplete last year due to weather conditions was also completed during the summer. Final deliverables received in the
	fall of 2016 are being utilized to support on-going engineering design and geological modeling.

	Bornite
	Project - Property Description and Location




	 




	The property is
	located in the Ambler mining district of the southern Brooks Range, in the NWAB of Alaska. The property is located in Ambler River
	A-2 quadrangle, Kateel River Meridian T 19N, R 9E, sections 4, 5, 8 and 9. The Bornite Project is located 248 km east of the town
	of Kotzebue, 19 km north of the village of Kobuk, 275 km west of the Dalton Highway, an all-weather state maintained public road,
	at geographic coordinates N67.07° latitude and W156.94° longitude (Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) North American
	Datum (NAD) 83, Zone 4W coordinates 7440449N, 589811E).




	 




	Bornite
	Project - Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure, and Physiography




	 




	Primary access
	to the Bornite Project is by air, using both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. There are four well maintained, approximately
	1,500 m-long gravel airstrips located near the property, capable of accommodating charter fixed wing aircraft. These airstrips
	are located 40 km west at Ambler, 23 km southwest at Shungnak, 19 km south at Kobuk, and 15 km south at Dahl Creek. There is daily
	commercial air service from Kotzebue to the village of Kobuk, the closest community to the property. During the summer months,
	the Dahl Creek Camp airstrip is suitable for larger aircraft, such as C-130 and DC-6. In addition to the four 1,500 m airstrips,
	there is a 700 m airstrip located at the Bornite Camp. The airstrip at Bornite is suited to smaller aircraft, which support the
	Bornite Camp with personnel and supplies.




	 




	There is no direct
	water access to the property. During spring runoff, river access is possible by barge from Kotzebue Sound to Ambler, Shungnak,
	and Kobuk via the Kobuk River.




	 




	A two-lane, two-wheel
	drive gravel road links the Bornite Project’s main camp to the 1,525 m Dahl Creek airstrip and village of Kobuk.




	 




	The climate in
	the region is typical of a sub-arctic environment. Exploration is generally conducted from late May until late September. Weather
	conditions on the Bornite Project can vary significantly from year to year and can change suddenly. During the summer exploration
	season, average maximum temperatures range from 10°C to 20°C, while average lows range from -2°C to 7°C. By early
	October, unpredictable weather limits safe helicopter travel to the property. During winter months, the property can be accessed
	by snow machine, track vehicle, or fixed wing aircraft. Winter temperatures are routinely below -25°C and can exceed -50°C.
	Annual precipitation in the region averages at 395 mm with the most rainfall occurring from June through September, and the most
	snowfall occurring from November through January.




	 




	Drilling and mapping
	programs are seasonal and have been supported out of the Main Bornite Camp and Dahl Creek Camp. The main Bornite Camp facilities
	are located on Ruby Creek on the northern edge of the Cosmos Hills. The camp provides office space and accommodations for the
	geologists, drillers, pilots, and support staff. There are four 2-person cabins installed by NANA prior to our tenure. In 2011,
	the main Bornite Camp was expanded to 20 sleeping tents, 3 administrative tents, 2 shower/bathroom tents, 1 medical tent, and
	1 dining/cooking tent. With these additions, the camp capacity was increased to 49 beds. A 30 m by 9 m core logging facility was
	also built in summer of 2011. An incinerator was installed near the Bornite airstrip to manage waste created by the Bornite Project.
	Power for the Bornite Project is supplied by a 175 kW Caterpillar diesel generator. Water is provided by a permitted artesian
	well located 250 m from the Bornite Camp. In 2012, the camp was further expanded with the addition of a laundry tent, a women's
	shower/washroom tent, a recreation tent, several additional sleeping tents, and a 2 x enlargement of the kitchen tent. Camp capacity
	increased to 76 beds. The septic field was upgraded to accommodate the increase in camp population. One of the two-person cabins
	was winterized for use by the winter caretaker. A permitted landfill was established to allow for the continued cleanup and rehabilitation
	of the historic shop facilities and surroundings. The Dahl Creek camp is a leased facility used as an overflow or alternative
	facility to the main Bornite Camp. The Dahl Creek camp has a main cabin for dining and administrative duties, and a shower facility.
	Sleeping facilities include two hard-sided sleeping cabins with seven beds (primarily used for staff), one 4-person sleeping tent,
	and three 2-person sleeping tents for a total of 17 beds. There are support structures, including a shop and storage facilities.

	The Bornite Project
	is located on Ruby Creek on the northern edge of the Cosmos Hills. The Cosmos Hills are part of the southern flank of the Brooks
	Range in Northwest Alaska. Topography in the area is moderately rugged. Maximum relief in the Cosmos Hills is approximately 1,000
	masl with an average of 600 masl. Talus covers the upper portions of the hills; glacial and fluvial sediments occupy valleys.
	The Kobuk Valley is located at the transition between boreal forest and Arctic tundra. Spruce, birch, and poplar are found in
	portions of the valley, with a ground cover of lichens (reindeer moss). Willow and alder thickets and isolated cottonwoods follow
	drainages, and alpine tundra is found at higher elevations. Tussock tundra and low, heath-type vegetation covers most of the valley
	floor. Patches of permafrost exist on the property. Wildlife in the property area is typical of Arctic and Subarctic fauna. Larger
	animals include caribou, moose, Dall sheep, bears (grizzly and black), wolves, wolverines, coyotes, and foxes. Fish species include
	salmon, sheefish, arctic char, and arctic grayling. The Kobuk River, which briefly enters the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects on
	its southwest corner, is a significant salmon spawning river. The caribou on the property belong to the Western Arctic herd that
	migrates twice a year – south in August, from their summer range north of the Brooks Range, and north in March from their
	winter range along the Buckland River.




	 




	Bornite
	Project - History




	 




	Kennecott
	and Bear Creek Mining Tenure




	 




	Regional exploration
	began in the early 1900s when gold prospectors noted copper occurrences in the hills north of Kobuk, Alaska. In 1947, local prospector
	Rhinehart “Rhiny” Berg along with various partners traversing in the area located outcropping mineralization along
	Ruby Creek (Bornite) on the north side of the Cosmos Hills. They subsequently staked claims over the Ruby Creek showings and constructed
	an airstrip for access. In 1957, BCMC, Kennecott's exploration subsidiary, optioned the property from Berg. Exploration drilling
	in 1961 and 1962 culminated in the discovery of the “No.1 Ore Body” where drill hole RC-34 cut 20 m of 24% copper
	(the “No.1 Ore Body” is a historic term used by BCMC that does not connote economic viability in the present context;
	it is convenient to continue to use the term to describe exploration work and historic resource estimation in a specific area
	of what is now generally known as Ruby Creek Upper Reef). The discovery of the “No.1 Ore Body” led to the development
	of an exploration shaft in 1966. The shaft, which reached a depth of 328 m, encountered a significant watercourse and was flooded
	near completion depth. The shaft was subsequently dewatered and an exploration drift was developed to provide access for sampling
	and mapping, and to accommodate underground drilling to further delineate mineralization. A total of 59 underground holes were
	drilled and, after the program, the shaft was allowed to re-flood. The discovery of the Arctic Project in 1965 prompted a hiatus
	in exploration at Bornite, and only limited drilling occurred up until 1976.




	 




	In the late 1990s,
	Kennecott resumed its evaluation of the Bornite deposit and the mineralization in the Cosmos Hills with an intensive soil, stream,
	and rock chip geochemical sampling program using 32 element ICP analyses. Grid soil sampling yielded 765 samples. Ridge and spur
	sampling resulted in an additional 850 soil samples in the following year. Skeletonized core samples (85 samples) from key historic
	drill holes were also analyzed using 32 element ICP analytical methods. Geochemical sampling identified multiple areas of elevated
	copper and zinc in the Bornite region.




	 




	Kennecott completed
	numerous geophysical surveys as an integral part of exploration throughout their tenure on the property. Various reports, notes,
	figures, and data files stored in Kennecott’s Salt Lake City exploration office indicated that geophysical work included,
	but was not limited to, the following:




	 








	·




	Airborne
	magnetic and EM surveys (fixed-wing INPUT) (1950s)






	 








	·




	Gravity,
	single point (“SP”), Audio-Frequency Magneto-Telluric (“AMT”),
	EM, borehole and surface IP/resistivity surveys (1960s)






	 








	·




	Gravity,
	airborne magnetic, and CSAMT surveys (1990s)






	 




	We have little
	information or documentation associated with these geophysical surveys conducted prior to the 1990s. Where data are available
	in these earlier surveys, the lack of details in data acquisition, coordinate systems, and data reduction procedures limit their
	usefulness. The only complete geophysical report available concerns down-hole IP/resistivity results. Most notable is the 1996
	Bouger gravity survey from the Bornite deposit into the Ambler lowlands. The Bornite deposit itself is seen as a significant 3
	milligal anomaly. Numerous 2 milligal to > 6 milligal anomalies occur under cover in the Ambler lowlands and near the Aurora
	Mountain and Pardner Hill occurrences. In addition to the geophysical surveys conducted by Kennecott, the ADNR completed an aeromagnetic
	survey of portions of the Ambler mining district in 1974-1975.




	 






	47






	 





	 




	Several studies
	have been undertaken reviewing the geology and geochemistry of the Bornite deposit. Most notable is Murray Hitzman’s PhD
	dissertation at Stanford University and Don Runnel’s PhD dissertation at Harvard University. Bernstein and Cox reported
	on mineralization of the “No. 1 Ore Body” in a 1986 paper in Economic Geology. In addition to the historical work,
	Ty Connor at the Colorado School of Mines recently completed a Master’s thesis which reported on the timing of alteration
	and mineralization at the Bornite deposit.




	 




	Kennecott conducted
	two technical reviews of the groundwater conditions and a summary of the findings related to the flooding of the exploration shaft.
	In 1961, Kennecott collected 32 coarse reject samples from five drill holes to support preliminary metallurgical test work at
	Bornite. Samples targeted high-grade (> 10%) copper mineralization from the Upper Reef at Ruby Creek.




	 




	Bornite
	Project - Geological Setting and Mineralization




	 




	The Bornite Project
	is located within the Arctic Alaska Terrane, a sequence of mostly Paleozoic continental margin rocks that make up the Brooks Range
	and North Slope of Alaska. It is within the Phyllite Belt geologic subdivision, which together with the higher-grade Schist Belt,
	stretches almost the entire length of the Brooks Range and is considered to represent the hinterland of the Jurassic Brooks Range
	orogeny. The southern margin of the Phyllite Belt is marked by mélange and low angle faults associated with the Kobuk River
	fault zone, while the northern boundary is thought to be gradational with the higher-grade metamorphic rocks of the Schist Belt.




	 




	The geology of
	the Bornite resource area is composed of alternating beds of carbonate rocks (limestone and dolostone) and calcareous phyllite.
	Limestone transitions laterally into dolostone, which hosts the majority of the mineralization and is considered to be hydrothermal
	in origin. Spatial relationships and petrographic work establish dolomitization as genetically related to early stages of the
	copper mineralizing system.




	 




	Work by Trilogy
	in 2015 focused on furthering the understanding of the distribution and nature of the various lithologic units and their context
	in a sedimentary depositional model. The updated model, based on lithogeochemical signatures of the various units along with their
	historical visual logging, shows stacked debris flows composed of basal non-argillaceous channelized debris flows breccias with
	a fining upward sequence of increasingly argillaceous-rich breccias capped by high calcium (Ca) phyllites, confined laterally
	in channels between either massive or thin-bedded platform carbonates. Two stacked debris flow sequences are apparent, the Lower
	and Upper reefs. The Upper reef grades vertically into capping argillaceous limestones instead of discrete high Ca phyllites indicating
	a shallowing upward or filling of the debris flow channels. Based on this updated interpretation, a series individual debris flow
	cycles have been modeled. Low calcium (Ca) phyllites, such as the Anirak schist (QP) and the Beaver Creek phyllite respectively
	underlie and cap the local stratigraphy suggesting different sourcing than the locally derived high Ca phyllites of the debris
	flow dominated Bornite Carbonate sequence stratigraphy. The Beaver Creek is in structural contact with the Bornite Carbonate Sequence
	while the contact with the underlying Anirak schist is an unconformity. In addition to the stacked sedimentary stratigraphy, a
	crosscutting breccia dubbed the P-Breccia has been identified in and around the recently discovered South Reef mineralization.
	Though poorly defined by the overall lack of drilling in the area, the body which contains excellent copper grade lies at or near
	the Iron Mountain discontinuity. It remains unclear whether the P Breccia is a post-depositional structural, hydrothermal or solution-collapse
	induced breccia.




	 




	Structural fabrics
	observed on the property include bedding and two separate foliations. Bedding (S0) can be measured only rarely where phyllite
	and carbonate are interbedded and it is unclear to what extent it is transposed. The pervasive foliation (S1) is easily measured
	in phyllites and may be reflected by colour banding and/or stylolamination (flaggy habit in outcrop) of the carbonates. Core logging
	shows that S1 is folded gently on the 10 m scale and locally tightly folded at the decimetre scale. S2 axial planar cleavage is
	locally developed in decimetre scale folds of S1. Both S1 and S2 foliations are considered to be Jurassic in age. Owing to their
	greater strength, bodies of secondary dolostone have resisted strain and foliation development, whereas the surrounding limestone
	and calc-phyllite appear in places to have been attenuated during deformation. This deformation, presumably Jurassic, complicates
	sedimentological interpretations. Potentially the earliest and most prominent structural feature in the resource area is the northeast-trending
	Iron Mountain discontinuity which is still problematic in its interpretation.

	Mineralization
	at Bornite occurs as tabular mineralized zones that coalesce into crudely stratiform bodies hosted in secondary dolomite. Two
	significant dolomitic horizons that host mineralization have been mapped by drilling and include: 1) the Lower Reef, a thick 100
	to 300 m thick dolomitized zone lying immediately above the basal quartz phyllite unit of the Anirak Schist; and 2) the Upper
	Reef, a 100 to 150 m thick dolomite horizon roughly 300 m higher in section.




	 




	The Lower Reef
	dolomite outcrops along the southern margin of the Ruby Creek zone and is spatially extensive throughout the deposit area. It
	hosts a significant portion of the shallow resources in the Ruby Creek zone as well as higher grade resources down dip and to
	the northeast in the South Reef. The Upper Reef zone hosts relatively high-grade resources to the north in the Ruby Creek zone.
	The Upper reef zone appears to lie at an important NE- trending facies transition to the NW of the main drilled area and locally
	appears to be at least partially thrust over the Lower Reef stratigraphy to the southeast.




	 




	Drill results from
	2013 show dolomitization and copper mineralization in the Upper and Lower Reefs coalescing into a single horizon along the northern
	limits of current exploration. The NE- trending Ruby Creek and South Reef zones also coalesce into a roughly 1000 m wide zone
	of >200 m thick dolomite containing significant copper mineralization dipping north at roughly 5-10 degrees.




	 




	Bornite
	Project – Mineralization




	 




	Copper
	mineralization at Bornite is comprised of chalcopyrite, bornite, and chalcocite distributed in stacked, roughly stratiform zones
	exploiting favourable stratigraphy within the dolomitized limestone package. Mineralization occurs, in order of increasing grade,
	as disseminations, irregular and discontinuous stringer-style veining, breccia matrix replacement, and stratiform massive sulphides.
	The distribution of copper mineral species is zoned around the bottom-centre of each zone, with bornite-chalcocite-chalcopyrite
	at the core and progressing outward to chalcopyrite-pyrite. Additional volumetrically minor copper species include carrollite,
	digenite, tennantite-tetrahedrite, and covellite. Stringer pyrite and locally significant sphalerite occur above and around the
	copper zones, while locally massive pyrite and sparse pyrrhotite occur in association with siderite alteration below copper mineralization
	in the Lower Reef.




	 




	In
	addition to the copper mineralization, significant cobalt mineralization is found accompanying bornite-chalcocite mineralization.
	Cobalt occurs with high-grade copper as both carrollite (Co2CuS4) and as cobaltiferous rims on recrystallized pyrite grains.




	 




	Appreciable
	silver values are also found with bornite-rich mineralization in the South Reef and Ruby Creek zones.




	 




	Bornite
	Project – Exploration




	 




	Exploration in
	and around the Bornite Project by Kennecott from 1957 to 1998 is summarized above. In addition to the extensive drilling completed
	during the more than 40 year tenure of Kennecott in the district, Kennecott completed widespread surface geochemical sampling,
	regional and property scale mapping, and numerous geophysical surveys employing a wide variety of techniques. The majority of
	this data has been acquired by us and forms the basis for renewed exploration that targets Bornite-style mineralization in the
	Bornite carbonate sequence.




	 




	NovaGold as the
	precursor company to us began to actively pursue an agreement to explore the Bornite Project with NANA in 2005 resulting in an
	initial airborne geophysical survey in 2006. Negotiations on the consolidation and exploration of the entire Ambler district continued
	for the next several years culminating in the NANA Agreement in October, 2011.




	 




	With the NANA Agreement
	approaching completion, NovaGold initiated work in 2010 to begin to characterize the exploration potential and depositional controls
	by re-logging and re-analyzing select drill holes with a Niton portable x-ray fluorescence (“XRF”) to determine geochemical
	variability. In 2011, NovaGold began an initial drill program to verify the historical database and exploration potential and
	conducted additional geophysical surveys to provide better targeting tools for continued exploration in the district. In 2012,
	we expanded the IP geophysical coverage completing a major district-wide survey that targeted the prospective Bornite Carbonate
	sequence. Subsequent resource drilling between 2011 and 2013




	based on the exploration targeting is discussed in
	the “

	Bornite Project - Mineral Resource Estimates”



	section below

	2006
	NovaGold Exploration




	 




	In 2006, NovaGold
	contracted Fugro Airborne Surveys to complete a detailed helicopter DIGHEM magnetic, EM and radiometric survey of the Cosmos Hills.
	The survey covered a rectangular block approximately 18 km by 49 km which totaled 2,852 line kilometres. The survey was flown
	at 300 m line spacing with a line direction of N20E. The DIGHEM helicopter survey system produced detailed profile data of magnetics,
	EM responses and radiometrics (total count, uranium, thorium, and potassium) and was processed into maps of magnetics, discrete
	EM anomalies, EM apparent resistivity, and radiometric responses.




	 




	2010
	NovaGold Exploration




	 




	In
	2010, in anticipation of completing the NANA Agreement, NANA granted NovaGold permission to begin low level exploration at Bornite;
	this consisted of re-logging and re-analyzing select drill holes using a Niton portable XRF. In addition to the 2010 re-logging
	effort, NovaGold contracted a consulting geophysicist, Lou O'Connor, to compile a unified airborne magnetic map for the Ambler
	mining district from Kennecott, Alaska DNR, and NovaGold airborne geophysical surveys.








	 




	2011
	NovaGold Exploration




	 




	In
	2011, NovaGold contracted Zonge International Inc. (“Zonge”) to conduct both dipole-dipole complex resistivity induced
	polarization (“CRIP”) and natural source audio-magnetotelluric (“NSAMT”) surveys over the northern end
	of the prospect to develop tools for additional exploration targeting under cover to the north.




	 




	NSAMT
	data were acquired along two lines totaling 5.15 line-km, with one line oriented generally north-south through the centre of the
	survey area and one being the southernmost east-west line in the survey area. CRIP data were acquired on five lines: four east-west
	lines and one north-south line, for a total coverage of 14.1 line-km and 79 collected CRIP stations. The initial objective of
	the survey was to investigate geological structures and the distribution of sulphides possibly associated with copper mineralization.




	 




	Results
	from the paired surveys show that wide-spaced dipole-dipole resistivity is the most effective technique to directly target the
	mineralization package. Broad low resistivity anomalies reflecting pyrite haloes and mineralization appear to define the limits
	of the fluid package. Well-defined and often very strong chargeability anomalies are also present, but appear in part to be masked
	by phyllitic units which also have strong chargeability signatures. The NSAMT show similar resistivity features as the IP, but
	are less well resolved.




	 




	2012
	Trilogy Exploration




	 




	In
	light of the success of the 2011 geophysical program, we contracted Zonge to conduct a major district-wide dipole/dipole IP survey,
	a down-hole IP radial array survey in the South Reef area, and an extensive physical property characterization study of the various
	lithologies to better interpret the existing historical geophysical data.




	 




	Zonge
	completed 48 line km of 200 m dipole/dipole IP during 2012, infilling and expanding on the 2011 survey, and stretching across
	the most prospective part of the outcropping permissive Bornite Carbonate sequence. The results show a well-defined low resistivity
	area associated with mineralization and variable IP signatures attributed both to mineralization and the overlying Beaver Creek
	phyllite. Numerous target areas occur in the immediate Bornite area with lesser targets occurring in the Aurora Mountain and Pardner
	Hill areas and in the far east of the survey area. During the 2012 drill program at South Reef, a single drill hole was targeted
	on a low resistivity area approximately 500 m to 600 m southeast of the South Reef mineralization trend. Although the drill hole
	intersected some dolomite alteration in the appropriate stratigraphy, no significant sulphides were encountered.




	 




	In
	addition to the extensive ground IP survey, Zonge also completed 9 km of down-hole radial IP using an electrode placed in drill
	hole RC12-0197 to further delineate the trend and potential in and around the South Reef. In addition to the 2012 ground geophysical
	surveys, extensive physical property data including resistivity, chargeability, specific gravity, and magnetic susceptibility
	were captured for use in modelling the existing ground IP and gravity surveys, and the airborne EM and magnetic surveys.




	 




	In
	addition to geophysical focused exploration, a district wide geologic map was compiled integrating Kennecott’s 1970’s
	mapping of the Cosmos Hills with selective Trilogy mapping in 2012.

	2013 Trilogy
	Exploration






	 




	The
	emphasis of the 2013 program was to further validate and refine the 2012 geologic map of the Cosmos Hills. A deep penetrating
	soil and vegetation geochemical orientation survey was completed over the South Reef deposit, utilizing various partial leaches
	and pH methods. The initial, approximately 1 km, test lines suggest a good response for several of the partial leaches of the
	soils but little response in the vegetative samples; further follow-up is warranted to the north of the deposit into the Ambler
	lowlands.






	 








	2014 Trilogy
	Exploration






	 




	During
	2014, exploration work was limited to a re-logging and re-sampling program of historical Kennecott drill core.






	 








	2015
	Trilogy Exploration






	 




	As
	a follow-up to the 2013 field program, a deep penetrating soil and vegetation geochemical survey was extended north of the deposit
	into the Ambler lowlands. Trilogy geologists completed a lithogeochemical desktop study and a comprehensive update to the 3D lithology
	model; the updated domains have been utilized in the most recent resource estimation.




	 






	Bornite
	Project – Drilling






	 




	A
	total of 183 surface core holes and 51 underground core holes, totaling 78,147 m have been drilled, targeting the Bornite deposit
	during 21 different annual campaigns dating from 1957 through 2013. All of the drill campaigns, with the exception of the 2011
	NovaGold campaign and the 2012 and 2013 Trilogy campaigns were completed by Kennecott or their exploration subsidiary BCMC. All
	drill holes (except RC13-230 and RC13-232 which have been reserved for metallurgical studies) were utilized in the estimation
	of the current resource.




	 




	Sprague
	and Henwood, a Pennsylvania-based drilling company, completed all of the Kennecott drilling, with the exception of the 1997 program
	(three drill holes) completed by Tonto Drilling Services, Inc. (a NANA-Dynatech company). The 2011 thru 2013 NovaGold/Trilogy
	programs used Boart Longyear Company as the drill contractor.




	 




	In
	the initial years of drilling at Bornite, Kennecott relied on AX core (1.1875 in or 30.2 mm diameter), but, as drilling migrated
	towards deeper targets, a change to BX core (1.625 in or 41.3 mm diameter) was implemented to help limit deviation. From 1966
	to 1967, drilling activity at Bornite moved underground and EX diameter core (0.845 in or 21.5 mm diameter) was implemented to
	define the Ruby Creek Upper Reef zone “No.1 Ore Body”. Drilling activity moved back to the surface in 1968, and, from
	1968 to 1972, BX core was most commonly drilled. In later years, core size increased to NX (2.125 in or 54.0 mm diameter) and
	finally, in 2011, core size increased to NQ (1.874 in or 47.6 mm diameter) and HQ (2.5 in or 63.5 mm diameter). Progressively
	larger diameter drill rods have been continually used over the years in an attempt to minimize drill hole deviations.




	 




	There
	is only partial knowledge of specific drill core handling procedures used by Kennecott during their tenure at the Bornite Deposit.
	All of the drill data collected during the Kennecott drilling programs (1958 to 1997) was logged on paper drill logs, copies of
	which are stored in the Kennecott office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Electronic scanned copies of the paper logs, in PDF format,
	are held by Trilogy. Drill core was sawed or split with a splitter, with half core submitted to various assay labs and the remainder
	stored in the Kennecott core storage facility at the Bornite Deposit. In 1995, Kennecott entered the drill assay data, the geologic
	core logs, and the down hole collar survey data into an electronic format. In 2009, NovaGold geologists verified the geologic
	data from the original paper logs against the Kennecott electronic format and then merged the data into a Microsoft™ SQL
	database. Sampling of drill core by Kennecott and BCMC focused primarily on the moderate to high grade mineralized zones. Intervals
	of visible sulphide mineralization containing roughly >0.5 to 1% copper were selected for analysis by Union Assay Office Inc.
	of Salt Lake City, Utah. This approach left numerous intervals containing weak to moderate copper mineralization un-sampled in
	the historic drill core. During the 2012 exploration program, we began sampling a portion of this remaining drill core in select
	holes in the South Reef area. Trilogy extended this sampling program to the Ruby Creek area in 2013 and 2014.




	 






	51






	 





	 




	Throughout
	our tenure at Bornite, the following core handling procedures have been implemented. Core is slung by helicopter, or transported
	by truck or ATV, from the drill rig to the core-logging facility. Upon delivery, geologists and geotechnicians open and inspect
	the core boxes for any irregularities. They first mark the location of each drilling block on the core box, and then convert footages
	on the blocks into metric equivalents. Geotechnicians or geologists measure the intervals (or “from/to”) for each
	box of core and include this information, together with the drill hole ID and box number, on a metal tag stapled to the end of
	each box. Geotechnicians then measure the core to calculate percent recovery and rock quality designation (“RQD”).
	RQD is the sum of the total length of all pieces of core over 12 cm in a run. The total length of core in each run is measured
	and compared to the corresponding run length to determine percent recovery. Core is then logged with lithology and visual alteration
	features captured on observed interval breaks. Mineralization data, including total sulphide (recorded as percent), sulphide type
	(recorded as a relative amount), and gangue and vein mineralogy are collected for each sample interval with an average interval
	of approximately 2 m. Structural data is collected as point data. Geologists then mark sample intervals to capture each lithology
	or other geologically appropriate intervals. Sample intervals of core are typically between 1 m and 3 m in length but are
	not to exceed 3 m in length. Occasionally, if warranted by the need for better resolution of geology or mineralization, smaller
	sample intervals have been employed. Geologists staple sample tags on the core boxes at the start of each sample interval, and
	mark the core itself with a wax pencil to designate sample intervals. This sampling approach is considered sound and appropriate
	for this style of mineralization and alteration. Drill core is digitally photographed prior to sampling. Drill core is cut in
	half using diamond core saws. Specific attention to core orientation is maintained during core sawing to ensure that representative
	samples are obtained. One-half of the core is retained in the core box for storage on site, or at our Fairbanks warehouse, and
	the other half bagged and labeled for analysis. Samples are selected for specific gravity measurements.




	 




	In
	2013, 33 historic drill holes in the Ruby Creek area, and in 2014, 37 historic drill holes in the Ruby Creek Area were re-logged,
	re-sampled and re-assayed as these holes had previously only been selectively sampled by Kennecott. Entire holes were re-logged
	utilizing Trilogy protocols discussed above. Samples were submitted either as halfcore, where previously sampled, or whole core
	where un-sampled (this was done to ensure that a sufficient volume of material was provided for analysis). Sample intervals were
	matched to historic intervals whenever possible, or selected to reflect Trilogy sampling procedures described above. The objectives
	of the re-assay/re-logging program were threefold: 1) to implement a QA/QC program on intervals previously sampled by Kennecott
	in order to confirm the validity of their results; 2) to identify additional lowergrade (0.2-0.5% copper), which was not previously
	sampled; and 3) to provide additional multi-element ICP data to assist in the geologic interpretation of the deposit.




	 




	Bornite
	Project - Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security




	 




	Sample
	preparation, analytical lab accreditation and security measures taken during historical Kennecott and BCMC programs are unknown
	to us; however, we are not aware of any reason to suspect that any of these samples have been tampered with. The 2011 to 2013
	samples were either in the custody of NovaGold or Trilogy personnel or the assay laboratories at all times, and the chain of custody
	of the samples is well documented.




	 




	Once
	drill core was sawed, one half was retained for future reference and the other half was sent to ALS Minerals (formerly ALS Chemex)
	in Vancouver for analyses. Shipment of core samples from the Bornite camp occurred whenever backhaul capacity was available on
	the chartered aircraft, which was generally 5 to 6 days a week. Rice bags, containing two to four individual poly-bagged core
	samples, were marked and labeled with the ALS Minerals address, project name (Bornite), drill hole number, bag number, and sample
	numbers enclosed. Rice bags were secured with a pre-numbered plastic security tie, assembled into loads for transport by chartered
	flights on a commercial airline to Fairbanks, and directly delivered by a contracted expeditor to the ALS Minerals preparation
	facility in Fairbanks. In addition to the core samples, control samples were inserted into the shipments at the approximate rate
	of one standard, one blank and one duplicate per 17 core samples. Samples were logged into a tracking system on arrival at ALS
	Minerals, and weighed. Samples were then crushed, dried, and a 250 g split was pulverized to greater than 85% passing 75 μm.




	 




	Gold
	assays in 2011 and 2012 were determined using fire analysis followed by an atomic absorption spectroscopy (“AAS”)
	finish; gold was not analyzed in 2013 or 2014. The lower detection limit was 0.005 ppm gold; the upper limit was 10 ppm gold.
	An additional 48-element suite was assayed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (“ICP-MS”) and ICP-AES
	methodologies, following a four acid digest. Over limit (>1.0%) copper and zinc analyses were completed by AA, following a
	four acid digest.




	 




	ALS
	Minerals has attained International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2000 registration. In addition, the ALS Minerals
	laboratory in Vancouver is accredited to ISO 17025 by Standards Council of Canada for a number of specific test procedures including
	fire assay of gold by AA, ICP and gravimetric finish, multi-element ICP and AA assays for silver, copper, lead and zinc. Trilogy
	has no relationship with any primary or check assay labs utilized.




	 






	52






	 





	 




	During
	2012, 2013 and 2014, Trilogy staff performed continuous validation of the drill data; both while logging was in progress and after
	the field program was complete. Trilogy also retained independent consultant Caroline Vallat, P.Geo. of GeoSpark Consulting Inc.
	to: 1) import digital drill data to the master database and conduct QA/QC checks upon import, 2) conduct a QA/QC review of paired
	historical assays and Trilogy 2012, 2013 and 2014 re-assays; 3) monitor an independent check assay program for the 2012, 2013,
	and 2014 campaigns; and 4) generate a QA/QC report for the 2012, 2013, and 2014 campaigns.




	 




	Bornite
	Project - Mineral Resource Estimates




	 




	The
	mineral resource estimate has been prepared by Bruce M. Davis, FAusIMM, BD Resource Consulting, and Robert Sim, P.Geo., SIM Geological
	Inc., both “Independent Qualified Persons” as defined in NI 43-101. We have filed three previous NI 43-101 Technical
	Reports on the Bornite Project dated March 18, 2014, February 5, 2013 and July 18, 2012. The effective date of this resource is
	April 19, 2016.




	 




	The
	Bornite Project database comprises a total of 235 diamond drill (core) holes totaling 78,745 m; 174 holes target the Ruby Creek
	zone and 42 holes target the South Reef zone. The remaining 19 holes in the database are exploratory in nature and test for satellite
	mineralization proximal to the Bornite Deposit. The database contains a total of 29,262 samples that have been analyzed for copper
	content. During 2014, Trilogy geologists re-logged and sampled 37 Kennecott drill holes comprising approximately 13,000 meters
	with partial or no assays. The new resource estimate incorporates the results from the 2014 field program as well as advancements
	to the 3D geological model completed during 2015.




	 




	Mineralization
	in the Ruby Creek zone occurs as two discrete strata bound lenses: a Lower Reef which outcrops and dips approximately 10-15 degrees
	to the northeast; and an Upper Reef lying roughly 150+ meters above the Lower Reef stratigraphy and which includes a small high-grade
	zone historically referred to as the "No.1 Orebody" by Kennecott. Mineralization is hosted by a Devonian age carbonate
	sequence containing broad zones of dolomite alteration and associated sulfide mineralization including bornite, chalcopyrite,
	and chalcocite occurring as disseminations and vein stockworks as well as crackle and mosaic breccia fillings and locally massive
	to semi-massive replacement bodies. The geological and assay database have been reviewed and audited by BDRC and SGI. It is of
	the opinion of BDRC and SGI that the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence the boundaries
	for copper mineralization and that the assay data are sufficiently reliable to support mineral resource estimation. That estimation
	utilizes two-meter compositing of assays from 216 drill holes completed between 1961 and 2013. Estimated blocks were 5 x 5 x 5
	meters on a side.




	 




	Sixty
	domains were established for the estimation, all of which were treated as hard boundaries with no mixing of data between the domains.
	A series of carbonate and phyllite lithology domains together with grade probability shells at 2% copper and 0.2% copper thresholds
	were used to constrain the estimates. Visual inspections of the probability shells show that they fit well with observed levels
	of bornite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite mineralization.




	 




	Based
	on the interpreted local high-grade nature of the mineralization, both capping and outlier restriction strategies were implemented
	to control the influence of high-grade mineralization in the resource model. This methodology removed approximately 3% of the
	contained copper in the Ruby Creek area and 7% of the contained copper in the South Reef area.




	 




	A
	total of 5,366 samples containing specific gravity measurements were utilized to estimate densities in the block model. Specific
	gravity values were estimated into model blocks using inverse distance squared moving averages using the domains described previously.




	 




	Copper
	grades in model blocks were estimated using ordinary kriging. A dynamic search orientation strategy was utilized, during both
	grade and specific gravity interpolations, which is controlled by the interpreted trends of mineralization in the Upper, Lower
	and South Reef zones. The block model has been validated through a combination of visual and statistical methods to ensure that
	the grade and density estimates are an appropriate representation of the underlying sample data.




	 






	53






	 





	 




	The
	Bornite deposit comprises several zones of relatively continuous moderate- to high-grade copper mineralization that extends from
	surface to depths of more than 800 m below surface. The deposit is potentially amenable to a combination of open pit and underground
	extraction methods. It is important to recognize that these discussions of underground and surface mining parameters are used
	solely for the purpose of testing the “reasonable prospects for economic extraction,” and do not represent an attempt
	to estimate mineral reserves. No mineral reserves have been calculated for the Bornite Project.




	 




	Indicated
	Mineral Resources includes blocks in the model that are potentially amenable to open pit extraction methods and are delineated
	by drilling with holes spaced at a maximum distance of 75 meters, and exhibit a relatively high degree of confidence in the grade
	and continuity of mineralization. Resources in the Inferred category require a minimum of one drill hole within a maximum distance
	of 100 m and exhibit reasonable confidence in the grade and continuity of mineralization.




	 




	In
	the opinion of the Qualified Persons, the level of understanding of the geologic controls that influence the distribution of copper
	mineralization at the Bornite Deposit is relatively good. The drilling, sampling and validation practices utilized by Trilogy
	during the various campaigns have been conducted in a professional manner and adhere to accepted industry standards. The confidence
	in older, historic, drilling conducted by Kennecott has been demonstrated through a series of validation checks and, overall,
	the underlying database is considered sufficient for the estimation of Indicated and Inferred mineral resources. The mineral resources
	have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practices
	Guidelines and are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators’ NI 43-101. Mineral resources are
	not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral
	resource will be converted into mineral reserve. The estimate of mineral resources for the Bornite Project are summarized in,

	Bornite
	Project – Metallurgy




	 




	Metallurgical
	testwork to date indicates that the Bornite Project can be treated using standard grinding and flotation methods to produce copper
	concentrates. Initial testing indicates copper recoveries of approximately 87% resulting in concentrate grades of approximately
	28% copper with very low potential penalty elements. Further metallurgical testwork is warranted to test these assumptions.




	 




	Bornite
	Project – Environmental Considerations




	 




	The Bornite Project
	area includes NANA’s Bornite and ANCSA lands, the Ruby Creek drainage (a tributary of the Shungnak River), the Shungnak
	River drainage, and portions of the Ambler Lowlands. Since 2007, baseline environmental data collection has occurred in the area
	including archaeology, aquatic life surveys, sediment sampling, wetlands mapping, surface water quality sampling, hydrology, meteorological
	monitoring, and subsistence. Additional baseline environmental data in NANA’s Bornite and ANCSA lands, the Ruby Creek drainage,
	the Shungnak River drainage, portions of the Ambler Lowlands, and downstream receiving environments will be required to support
	future mine design, development of an EIS, permitting, construction and operations.

	Bornite
	Project – Mining Operations




	 




	The
	Bornite Project is not currently in production; for contemplated exploration or development activities see below.




	 




	Bornite
	Project – Exploration and Development Permitting




	 




	Development of
	the Bornite Project will require a significant number of permits and authorizations from state, federal, and regional organizations.
	Much of the groundwork to support a successful permitting effort must be undertaken prior to submission of permit applications
	so that issues can be identified and resolved, baseline data can be acquired, and regulators and stakeholders can become familiar
	with the proposed project. The comprehensive permitting process for the Bornite Project can be divided into three categories:




	 








	1.




	Exploration
	state/regional permitting: required to obtain approval for drilling, camp operations,
	engineering, and environmental baseline studies.






	 








	2.




	Pre-application
	phase: conducted in conjunction with engineering feasibility studies. This stage includes
	the collection of environmental baseline data and interaction with stakeholders and regulators
	to facilitate the development of a project that can be successfully permitted.






	 








	3.




	The
	National Environmental Policy Act phase: formal agency review of the Federal and State
	requirements for public and agency participation to determine if and how the Bornite
	Project can be done in an acceptable manner.






	 




	The permit review
	process will determine the number of management plans required to address all aspects of the Project to ensure compliance with
	environmental design and permit criteria. Each plan will describe the appropriate environmental engineering standard and the applicable
	operations requirements, maintenance protocols, and response actions.






	 








	Bornite Project
	– Current Activities






	 




	Following
	the release in the spring of 2016 of the Bornite Report, we focused field investigations and drilling activities on advancing
	our Arctic Project towards pre-feasibility. Field work at the Bornite Project consisted of continued environmental baseline data
	collection and the completion of the LiDAR survey over the greater project area initiated in 2015. We continue to evaluate geological
	and hydrogeological data to support internal desktop evaluations and planning of future field investigations at the Bornite project.





	 












	Item 3.




	LEGAL
	PROCEEDINGS






	 




	From
	time to time, we are a party to routine litigation and proceedings that are considered part of the ordinary course of business.
	We are not aware of any material current, pending, or threatened litigation. There are no material proceedings pursuant to which
	any of our directors, officers or affiliates or any owner of record or beneficial owner of more than 5% of our securities or any
	associate of any such director, officer or security holder is a party adverse to us or has a material interest adverse to us.





	 












	Item 4.




	MINE
	SAFETY DISCLOSURES






	 




	Operations are
	subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety
	and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). At our current stage of exploration, we are not yet subject to MSHA.




	 




	Companies required
	to file periodic reports under the Exchange Act, that operate mines regulated under the Mine Act are required to make certain
	disclosures pursuant to Section 1503(a) of Dodd-Frank. We have nothing to disclose pursuant to Section 1503(a) of Dodd-Frank for
	the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016.

	Dividend
	Policy






	 





	We have not declared
	or paid any dividends on our Common Shares. Our current business plan requires that for the foreseeable future, any future earnings
	be reinvested to finance the growth and development of our business. We will not declare or pay any dividends until such time
	as our cash flow exceeds our capital requirements and will depend upon, among other things, conditions then existing including
	earnings, financial condition, restrictions in financing arrangements, business opportunities and conditions and other factors,
	or our Board determines that our shareholders could make better use of the cash.

	Certain
	Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders






	 





	The following is
	a general summary of the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable under

	Income Tax Act

	(Canada) (the “Tax Act”) to a holder of Common Shares, each of whom, at all relevant times, for the purposes of the
	Tax Act, holds such Common Shares as capital property, deals at arm’s length with the Company, is not affiliated with the
	Company and, for purposes of the Tax Act, is not, and is not deemed to be, a resident of Canada and has not and will not use or
	hold or be deemed to use or hold the Common Shares in the course of carrying on business in Canada (a “Non-Resident Holder”).
	Special rules, which are not discussed below, may apply to a non-resident of Canada that is an insurer which carries on business
	in Canada and elsewhere.




	 




	The Common Shares
	will generally be considered capital property to a Non-Resident Holder unless either (i) the Non-Resident Holder holds the Common
	Shares in the course of carrying on a business of buying and selling securities or (ii) the Non-Resident Holder has acquired the
	Common Shares in a transaction or transactions considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.




	 




	The term “U.S.
	Holder,” for the purposes of this section, means a Non-Resident Holder who, for purposes of the

	Canada-United States
	Income Tax Convention

	(1980) as amended, (the “Convention”), is at all relevant times a resident of the United
	States and is a “qualifying person” within the meaning of the Convention. In some circumstances, fiscally transparent
	entities (including limited liability companies) will be entitled to benefits under the Convention. U.S. Holders are urged to
	consult with their own tax advisors to determine their entitlement to benefits under the Convention based on their particular
	circumstances.




	 




	This summary is
	based on the current provisions of the Tax Act, the regulations thereunder (the “Regulations”), the current provisions
	of the Convention, counsel’s understanding of the current published administrative policies and assessing practices of the
	Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”) publicly available prior to the date hereof.




	 




	This summary also
	takes into account all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act and Regulations publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minister
	of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (collectively, the “Proposed Tax Amendments”). No assurances can be given
	that the Proposed Tax Amendments will be enacted or will be enacted as proposed. Other than the Proposed Tax Amendments, this
	summary does not take into account or anticipate any changes in law or the administration policies or assessing practice of CRA,
	whether by judicial, legislative, governmental or administrative decision or action, nor does it take into account provincial,
	territorial or foreign income tax legislation or considerations, which may differ significantly from those discussed herein.






	 








	This summary
	is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular
	U.S. Holder and no representations with respect to the income tax consequences to any particular U.S. Holder are made. This summary
	is not exhaustive of all Canadian federal income tax considerations. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
	with respect to their own particular circumstances. The discussion below is qualified accordingly.








	 








	Currency
	Conversion






	 




	Subject to certain
	exceptions that are not discussed herein, for purposes of the Tax Act, all amounts relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition
	of Common Shares, including dividends, adjusted cost base and proceeds of dispositions must be determined in Canadian dollars
	using the daily noon rate (or, beginning March 1, 2017, the single daily exchange rate) of the Bank of Canada on the particular
	date the particular amount arose or such other rate of exchange as acceptable to the CRA.




	 






	58






	 







	 








	Disposition
	of Common Shares






	 




	A Non-Resident
	Holder will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act in respect of any capital gain realized by such Non-Resident Holder on a disposition
	of the Common Shares, nor will capital losses arising from the disposition be recognized under the Tax Act, unless the Common
	Shares constitute “taxable Canadian property” (as defined in the Tax Act) of the Non-Resident Holder at the time of
	disposition and the Non-Resident Holder is not entitled to relief under an applicable income tax treaty or convention. As long
	as the shares are then listed on a “designated stock exchange” (as defined in the Tax Act) (which currently includes
	the TSX and the NYSE-MKT) at the time of disposition, the Common Shares generally will not constitute taxable Canadian property
	of a Non-Resident Holder, unless at any time during the 60-month period immediately preceding the disposition the following two
	conditions are not met concurrently: (i) the Non-Resident Holder, persons with whom the Non-Resident Holder did not deal at arm’s
	length, partnerships in which the taxpayer or persons with whom the taxpayer did not deal at arm’s length holds a membership
	interest directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships, or the Non-Resident Holder together with all such persons, owned
	or was considered to own 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of shares of the capital stock of the Company;
	and (ii) more than 50% of the fair market value of the Common Shares was derived directly or indirectly from one or any combination
	of real or immovable property situated in Canada, “Canadian resource properties” (as defined in the Tax Act), “timber
	resource properties” (as defined in the Tax Act) or a options in respect of, or interests in, or civil law rights in, such
	properties, whether or not it exists.




	 




	If the Common Shares
	are taxable Canadian property to a Non-Resident Holder, any capital gain realized on the disposition or deemed disposition of
	such shares, may not be subject to Canadian federal income tax pursuant to the terms of an applicable income tax treaty or convention
	between Canada and the country of residence of a Non-Resident Holder, including the Convention.






	 








	A Non-Resident
	Holder whose shares are taxable Canadian property should consult their own advisors.








	 








	Dividends
	on Common Shares






	 




	Under the Tax Act,
	dividends on shares paid or credited to a Non-Resident Holder will be subject to Canadian withholding tax at the rate of 25% of
	the gross amount of the dividends. This withholding tax may be reduced pursuant to the terms of an applicable income tax treaty
	or convention between Canada and the country of residence of a Non-Resident Holder. Under the Convention, a U.S. Holder will generally
	be subject to Canadian withholding tax at a rate of 15% of the gross amount of such dividends (or 5% in the case of a U.S. Holder
	that is a company beneficially owning at least 10% of the Company’s voting shares). In addition, under the Convention, dividends
	may be exempt from Canadian non-resident withholding tax if paid to certain U.S. Holders that are qualifying religious, scientific,
	literary, educational or charitable tax-exempt organizations and qualifying trusts, companies, organizations or arrangements operated
	exclusively to administer or provide pension, retirement or employee benefits that are exempt from tax in the United States and
	that have complied with specific administrative procedures.





	 






	Certain
	U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations






	 





	The following is
	a general summary of certain anticipated U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to a U.S. Holder (as defined below)
	arising from and relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Common Shares.




	 




	This summary is
	for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential U.S. federal
	income tax considerations that may apply to a U.S. Holder as a result of acquisition of Common Shares. Furthermore, this summary
	does not take into account the individual facts and circumstances of any particular U.S. Holder that may affect the U.S. federal
	income tax considerations applicable to such U.S. Holder of Common Shares. Except as specified below, this summary does not discuss
	applicable tax reporting requirements. Accordingly, this summary is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, legal
	or U.S. federal income tax advice with respect to any U.S. Holder. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding
	the U.S. federal, U.S. state and local, and foreign tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of
	Common Shares.

	No ruling from
	the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or legal opinion has been requested, or will be obtained, regarding
	the potential U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to U.S. Holders as discussed in this summary. This summary is
	not binding on the IRS, and the IRS is not precluded from taking a position that is different from, and contrary to, the positions
	taken in this summary. In addition, because the authorities on which this summary is based are subject to various interpretations,
	the IRS and the U.S. courts could disagree with one or more of the positions taken in this summary.





	 






	Scope
	of this Summary






	 






	Authorities





	 




	This summary is
	based on the U.S. Internal Revenue, as amended (“Code”), regulations promulgated by the Department of the Treasury
	(whether final, temporary or proposed) (“Treasury Regulations”), U.S. court decisions, published rulings and administrative
	positions of the IRS, and the Convention, that are applicable and, in each case, in effect as of the date of this document. Any
	of the authorities on which this summary is based could be changed in a material and adverse manner at any time, and any such
	change could be applied on a retroactive or prospective basis, which could affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations described
	in this summary. This summary does not discuss the potential effects, whether adverse or beneficial, of any proposed legislation
	that, if enacted, could be applied on a retroactive basis.





	 






	U.S.
	Holders





	 




	For purposes of
	this section, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Common Shares that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is
	(a) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (b) a corporation,
	or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is created or organized in or under the
	laws of the United States or any state in the United States, including the District of Columbia; (c) an estate if the income
	of such estate is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of the source of such income; or (d) a trust if (i) such
	trust has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (ii) a U.S. court is able
	to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control
	all substantial decisions of such trust.





	 






	Non-U.S.
	Holders





	 




	For purposes of
	this summary, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Common Shares that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a U.S.
	partnership (or other “pass-through” entity). This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations
	applicable to Non-U.S. Holders relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Common Shares. Accordingly, Non-U.S.
	Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, U.S. state and local, and foreign tax consequences (including
	the potential application of and operation of any tax treaties) relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Common
	Shares.





	 






	U.S.
	Holders Subject to Special U.S. Federal Income Tax Rules Not Addressed





	 




	This summary does
	not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to U.S. Holders that are subject to special provisions under
	the Code, including (a) U.S. Holders that are tax-exempt organizations, qualified retirement plans, individual retirement
	accounts or other tax-deferred accounts; (b) U.S. Holders that are financial institutions, underwriters, insurance companies,
	real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies or that are broker-dealers, dealers, or traders in securities
	or currencies that elect to apply a mark-to-market accounting method; (c) U.S. Holders that have a “functional currency”
	other than the U.S. dollar; (d) U.S. Holders that own Common Shares as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion
	transaction, constructive sale or other arrangement involving more than one position; (e) U.S. Holders that acquired Common
	Shares in connection with the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation for services; (f) U.S. Holders
	that hold Common Shares other than as a capital asset (generally property held for investment purposes) within the meaning of
	Section 1221 of the Code; or (g) U.S. Holders that own, directly, indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more, by voting power or
	value, of the outstanding shares of the Company. The summary below also does not address the impact on persons who are U.S. expatriates
	or former long-term residents of the United States subject to Section 877 of the Code. U.S. Holders and others that are subject
	to special provisions under the Code, including U.S. Holders described immediately above, should consult their own tax advisors.




	 






	60






	 




	 



	If an entity that
	is classified as a partnership (or other “pass-through” entity) for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Common
	Shares, the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to such partnership (or “pass-through” entity) and the
	partners of such partnership (or owners of such “pass-through” entity) generally will depend on the activities of
	the partnership (or “pass-through” entity) and the status of such partners (or owners). Partners of entities that
	are classified as partnerships (and owners of “pass-through” entities) for U.S. federal income tax purposes should
	consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition
	of Common Shares.





	 






	Tax
	Consequences Other than U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences Not Addressed





	 




	This summary does
	not address the U.S. state and local, U.S. estate and gift, U.S. alternative minimum tax, or foreign tax consequences to U.S.
	Holders relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Common Shares. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax
	advisor regarding the U.S. state and local, U.S. estate and gift, U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and foreign tax consequences
	relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Common Shares.




	 




	U.S.
	Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Acquisition, Ownership and Disposition of Common Shares





	 






	Distributions
	on Common Shares





	 




	Subject to the
	PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder that receives a distribution, including a constructive distribution, with respect to
	a Common Share will be required to include the amount of such distribution in gross income as a dividend (without reduction for
	any Canadian income tax withheld from such distribution) to the extent of the current or accumulated “earnings and profits”
	of the Company, as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent that a distribution exceeds the current and accumulated
	“earnings and profits” of the Company, such distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to
	the extent of a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Common Shares and thereafter as a gain from the sale or exchange of such
	Common Shares (see “

	Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Shares

	” below). However, the Company does not
	intend to maintain the calculations of earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles, and each U.S.
	Holder should therefore assume that any distribution by the Company with respect to the Common Shares will constitute ordinary
	dividend income. Subject to applicable limitations, dividends paid by the Company to non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals,
	generally will be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains for dividends, provided certain
	holding period and other conditions are satisfied, including that the Company not be classified as a PFIC (as discussed below)
	in the tax year of distribution or in the preceding tax year. Dividends received on Common Shares by corporate U.S. Holders will
	not be eligible for the “dividends received deduction”. The dividend rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder should
	consult its own tax advisor regarding the application of such rules.





	 






	Sale
	or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Shares





	 




	Subject to the
	PFIC rules discussed below, upon the sale or other taxable disposition of Common Shares a U.S. Holder generally will recognize
	capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (a) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any
	property received and (b) its tax basis in such Common Shares sold or otherwise disposed of. Such gain generally will be treated
	as “U.S. source” for purposes of applying the U.S. foreign tax credit rules unless the gain is subject to tax in Canada
	and is re-sourced as “foreign source” under the Convention and such U.S. Holder elects to treat such gain or loss
	as “foreign source” (see a more detailed discussion at “

	Foreign Tax Credit

	” below). Any such gain
	or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the sale or other
	disposition, such Common Shares are held for more than one year. Preferential tax rates apply to long-term capital gains of a
	U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate, or trust. There are currently no preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains
	of a U.S. Holder that is a corporation. Deductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations under the Code.





	 






	Foreign
	Tax Credit





	 




	A U.S. Holder who
	pays (whether directly or through withholding) Canadian income tax with respect to dividends paid on the Common Shares generally
	may elect to deduct or credit such tax. This election is made on a year-by-year basis and applies to all foreign taxes paid (whether
	directly or through withholding) by a U.S. Holder during a year.




	 






	61






	 




	 



	Complex limitations
	apply to the foreign tax credit, including the general limitation that the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of a U.S.
	Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability that such U.S. Holder’s “foreign source” taxable income bears
	to such U.S. Holder’s worldwide taxable income. In applying this limitation, a U.S. Holder’s various items of income
	and deduction must be classified, under complex rules, as either “foreign source” or “U.S. source”. In
	addition, this limitation is calculated separately with respect to specific categories of income. Dividends paid by the Company
	generally will constitute “foreign source” income and generally will be categorized as “passive category income”.
	However, and subject to certain exceptions, a portion of the dividends paid by a foreign corporation will be treated as U.S. source
	income for United States foreign tax credit purposes, in proportion to its U.S. source earnings and profits, if United States
	persons own, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of the voting power or value of the foreign corporation’s shares.
	A portion of any dividends paid with respect to the Common Shares may be treated as U.S. source income under these rules, which
	may limit the ability of a U.S. Holder to claim a foreign tax credit for any Canadian withholding taxes payable in respect of
	such amount. Because the foreign tax credit rules are complex, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
	foreign tax credit rules, including the source of any dividends paid to U.S. Holders.




	 




	Subject to certain
	specific rules, foreign income and withholding taxes paid with respect to any distribution in respect of stock in a PFIC should
	qualify for the foreign tax credit. The rules relating to distributions by a PFIC are complex, and a U.S. Holder should consult
	with its own tax advisor with respect to any distribution received from a PFIC.





	 






	Receipt
	of Foreign Currency





	 







	The amount of any distribution paid in
	foreign currency to a U.S. Holder in connection with the ownership of Common Shares, or on the sale, exchange or other taxable
	disposition of Common Shares, generally will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the exchange
	rate applicable on the date of actual or constructive receipt (regardless of whether such foreign currency is converted into U.S.
	dollars at that time). If the foreign currency received is not converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder
	will have a basis in the foreign currency equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date of receipt. A U.S. Holder that receives foreign
	currency and converts such foreign currency into U.S. dollars at a conversion rate other than the rate in effect on the date of
	receipt may have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss, which generally would be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or
	loss for foreign tax credit purposes. Different rules apply to U.S. Holders who use the accrual method of tax accounting. U.S.
	Holders should consult their own U.S. tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of receiving, owning and
	disposing of foreign currency. 








	 






	Additional
	Tax on Passive Income





	 




	Individuals, estates
	and certain trusts whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be required to pay a 3.8% Medicare surtax on “net investment
	income” including, among other things, dividends and net gain from disposition of property (other than property held in
	certain trades or businesses). U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this tax
	on their ownership and disposition of Common Shares.





	 






	Passive
	Foreign Investment Company Rules





	 




	If the Company
	is considered a PFIC within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code at any time during a U.S. Holder’s holding period, then
	certain different and potentially adverse tax consequences would apply to such U.S. Holder’s acquisition, ownership and
	disposition of Common Shares.





	 






	PFIC
	Status of the Company





	 




	The Company generally
	will be a PFIC if, for a given tax year, (a) 75% or more of the gross income of the Company for such tax year is passive income
	or (b) 50% or more of the assets held by the Company either produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income,
	based on the fair market value of such assets. “Gross income” generally includes all revenues less the cost of goods
	sold plus income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources, and “passive income” includes,
	for example, dividends, interest, certain rents and royalties, certain gains from the sale of stock and securities, and certain
	gains from commodities transactions. Active business gains arising from the sale of commodities generally are excluded from passive
	income if substantially all (85% or more) of a foreign corporation’s commodities are stock in trade or inventory, depreciable
	property used in a trade or business, or supplies regularly used or consumed in a trade or business, and certain other requirements
	are satisfied.




	 






	62






	 




	 



	For
	purposes of the PFIC income test and asset test described above, if the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the
	total value of the outstanding shares of another corporation, the Company will be treated as if it (a) held a proportionate share
	of the assets of such other corporation and (b) received directly a proportionate share of the income of such other corporation.
	In addition, for purposes of the PFIC income test and asset test described above, “passive income” does not include
	any interest, dividends, rents or royalties that are received or accrued by the Company from a “related person” (as
	defined in Section 954(d)(3) of the Code), to the extent such items are properly allocable to the income of such related person
	that is not passive income.




	 




	Under
	certain attribution rules, if the Company is a PFIC, U.S. Holders will be deemed to own their proportionate share of any subsidiary
	of the Company which is also a PFIC (a “Subsidiary PFIC”), and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on (a) a
	distribution on the shares of a Subsidiary PFIC and (b) a disposition of shares of a Subsidiary PFIC, both as if the U.S. Holder
	directly held the shares of such Subsidiary PFIC. 



	 


	The Company believes that it was not a
	PFIC for the tax years ended November 30, 2014, 2015, and 2016, but may be a PFIC in future tax years. No opinion of legal counsel
	or ruling from the IRS concerning the status of the Company as a PFIC has been obtained or is currently planned to be requested.
	The determination of whether the Company (or a subsidiary of the Company) was, or will be, a PFIC for a tax year depends, in part,
	on the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. In addition, whether
	the Company (or subsidiary) will be a PFIC for any tax year depends on the assets and income of the Company (and each such subsidiary)
	over the course of each such tax year and, as a result, cannot be predicted with certainty as of the date of this document. Accordingly,
	there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge any determination made by the Company (or subsidiary) concerning its
	PFIC status or that the Company (and any subsidiary) was not, or will not be, a PFIC for any tax year. U.S. Holders should consult
	their own tax advisors regarding the PFIC status of the Company and any subsidiary of the Company. 








	 






	Default
	PFIC Rules under Section 1291 of the Code





	 




	If the Company
	is a PFIC, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Common Shares
	will depend on whether such U.S. Holder makes a QEF election or makes a mark-to-market election under Section 1296 of the
	Code (a “Mark-to-Market Election”) with respect to Common Shares. A U.S. Holder that does not make either a QEF Election
	or a Mark-to-Market Election will be referred to in this summary as a “Non-Electing U.S. Holder”.




	 




	A Non-Electing
	U.S. Holder will be subject to the rules of Section 1291 of the Code with respect to (a) any gain recognized on the
	sale or other taxable disposition of Common Shares and (b) any excess distribution paid on the Common Shares. A distribution
	generally will be an “excess distribution” to the extent that such distribution (together with all other distributions
	received in the current tax year) exceeds 125% of the average distributions received during the three preceding tax years (or
	during a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Common Shares, if shorter).




	 




	If the Company
	is a PFIC, under Section 1291 of the Code any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of Common Shares (including
	an indirect disposition of shares of a Subsidiary PFIC), and any excess distribution paid on Common Shares (or a distribution
	by a Subsidiary PFIC to its shareholder that is deemed to be received by a U.S. Holder) must be ratably allocated to each day
	of a Non-Electing U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Common Shares. The amount of any such gain or excess distribution
	allocated to the tax year of disposition or excess distribution and to years before the Company became a PFIC, if any, would be
	taxed as ordinary income. The amounts allocated to any other tax year would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the highest
	tax applicable to ordinary income in each such year, and an interest charge would be imposed on the tax liability for each such
	year, calculated as if such tax liability had been due in each such year. A Non-Electing U.S. Holder that is not a corporation
	must treat any such interest paid as “personal interest”, which is not deductible.




	 




	If the Company
	is a PFIC for any tax year during which a Non-Electing U.S. Holder holds Common Shares, the Company will continue to be treated
	as a PFIC with respect to such Non-Electing U.S. Holder, regardless of whether the Company ceases to be a PFIC in one or more
	subsequent years. If the Company ceases to be a PFIC, a Non-Electing U.S. Holder may terminate this deemed PFIC status with respect
	to Common Shares by electing to recognize gain (which will be taxed under the rules of Section 1291 of the Code discussed
	above) as if such Common Shares were sold on the last day of the last tax year for which the Company was a PFIC.




	 






	63






	 





	 




	Under proposed
	Treasury Regulations, if a U.S. Holder has an option, warrant or other right to acquire stock of a PFIC, such option, warrant
	or right is considered to be PFIC stock subject to the default rules of Section 1291 of the Code. Under rules described below,
	if the Company was a PFIC, the holding period for the option, warrant or other right would begin on the day after the date a U.S.
	Holder acquired the option, warrant or other right. This would impact the availability of the QEF Election and Mark-to-Market
	Election with respect to an option, warrant or other right. Thus, a U.S. Holder would have to account for an option, warrant or
	other right and Common Shares under the PFIC rules and the applicable elections differently (see discussion below under “

	QEF
	Election

	” and “

	Market-to-Market Election

	”.)





	 






	QEF
	Election





	 




	In the event the
	Company is a PFIC and a U.S. Holder makes a QEF Election for the first tax year in which its holding period of its Common Shares
	begins, such U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to the rules of Section 1291 of the Code discussed above with respect
	to its Common Shares. However, a U.S. Holder that makes a QEF Election will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such U.S.
	Holder’s pro rata share of (a) the net capital gain of the Company, which will be taxed as long-term capital gain to
	such U.S. Holder, and (b) the ordinary earnings of the Company, which will be taxed as ordinary income to such U.S. Holder.
	Generally, “net capital gain” is the excess of (a) net long-term capital gain over (b) net short-term capital
	gain, and “ordinary earnings” are the excess of (a) “earnings and profits” over (b) net capital gain.
	A U.S. Holder that makes a QEF Election will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such amounts for each tax year in which
	the Company is a PFIC, regardless of whether such amounts are actually distributed to such U.S. Holder by the Company. However,
	a U.S. Holder that makes a QEF Election may, subject to certain limitations, elect to defer payment of current U.S. federal income
	tax on such amounts, subject to an interest charge. If such U.S. Holder is not a corporation, any such interest paid will be treated
	as “personal interest”, which is not deductible.




	 




	A U.S. Holder that
	makes a QEF Election generally (a) may receive a tax-free distribution from the Company to the extent that such distribution
	represents “earnings and profits” of the Company that were previously included in income by the U.S. Holder because
	of such QEF Election and (b) will adjust such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Common Shares to reflect the amount included
	in income or allowed as a tax-free distribution because of such QEF Election. In addition, a U.S. Holder that makes a QEF Election
	generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of Common Shares.




	 




	The procedure for
	making a QEF Election, and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of making a QEF Election, will depend on whether such QEF
	Election is timely. A QEF Election will be treated as “timely” if it is made for the first year in the U.S. Holder’s
	holding period for the Common Shares in which the Company was a PFIC. A U.S. Holder may make a timely QEF Election by filing the
	appropriate QEF Election documents at the time such U.S. Holder files a U.S. federal income tax return for such year.




	 




	A QEF Election
	will apply to the tax year for which such QEF Election is made and to all subsequent tax years, unless such QEF Election is invalidated
	or terminated or the IRS consents to revocation of such QEF Election. If a U.S. Holder makes a QEF Election and, in a subsequent
	tax year, the Company ceases to be a PFIC, the QEF Election will remain in effect (although it will not be applicable) during
	those tax years in which the Company is not a PFIC. Accordingly, if the Company becomes a PFIC in a subsequent tax year, the QEF
	Election will be effective, and the U.S. Holder will be subject to the QEF rules described above during a subsequent tax year
	in which the Company qualifies as a PFIC.




	 




	As discussed above,
	under proposed Treasury Regulations, if a U.S. Holder has an option, warrant or other right to acquire stock of a PFIC, such option,
	warrant or right is considered to be PFIC stock subject to the default rules of Section 1291 of the Code on its disposition. However,
	a holder of an option, warrant or other right to acquire stock of a PFIC may not make a QEF Election that will apply to the option,
	warrant or other right to acquire PFIC stock. In addition, under proposed Treasury Regulations, if a U.S. Holder holds an option,
	warrant or other right to acquire stock of a PFIC, the holding period with respect to shares of stock of the PFIC acquired upon
	exercise of such option, warrant or other right will include the period that the option, warrant or other right was held. U.S.
	Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to Common Shares.




	 






	64






	 





	 




	The Company will
	make available to U.S. Holders, upon their written request, timely and accurate information as to its status as a PFIC, and will
	provide to a U.S. Holder all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder making a QEF Election with respect to the Company,
	and any Subsidiary PFIC in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of such Subsidiary PFIC’s total
	aggregate voting power, is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the event it is a PFIC. However, U.S. Holders
	should be aware that the Company can provide no assurances that it will provide any such information relating to any Subsidiary
	PFIC, in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or less of such Subsidiary PFIC’s aggregate voting power. Because
	the Company may own shares in one or more Subsidiary PFICs, and may acquire shares in one or more Subsidiary PFICs in the future,
	they will continue to be subject to the rules discussed above with respect to the taxation of gains and excess distributions with
	respect to any Subsidiary PFIC for which the U.S. Holders do not obtain the required information. U.S. Holders should consult
	their tax advisor regarding the availability of, and procedure for making, a QEF Election with respect to the Company and any
	Subsidiary PFIC.





	 






	Mark-to-Market
	Election





	 




	A U.S. Holder may
	make a Mark-to-Market Election only if the Common Shares are marketable stock. The Common Shares generally will be “marketable
	stock” if they are regularly traded on (a) a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC; (b) the
	national market system established pursuant to section 11A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934; or (c) a foreign securities
	exchange that is regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located, provided that
	(i) such foreign exchange has trading volume, listing, financial disclosure and other requirements and the laws of the country
	in which such foreign exchange is located, together with the rules of such foreign exchange, ensure that such requirements are
	actually enforced; and (ii) the rules of such foreign exchange ensure active trading of listed stocks. If such stock is traded
	on such a qualified exchange or other market, such stock generally will be “regularly traded” for any calendar year
	during which such stock is traded, other than in de minimis quantities, on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter. Each
	U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding whether the Common Shares constitute marketable stock.




	 




	A U.S. Holder that
	makes a Mark-to-Market Election with respect to its Common Shares generally will not be subject to the rules of Section 1291
	of the Code discussed above. However, if a U.S. Holder does not make a Mark-to-Market Election beginning in the first tax year
	of such U.S. Holder’s holding period for Common Shares or such U.S. Holder has not made a timely QEF Election, the rules
	of Section 1291 of the Code discussed above will apply to certain dispositions of, and distributions on, the Common Shares.




	 




	A U.S. Holder that
	makes a Mark-to-Market Election will include in ordinary income, for each tax year in which the Company is a PFIC, an amount equal
	to the excess, if any, of (a) the fair market value of the Common Shares, as of the close of such tax year over (b) such
	U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such Common Shares. A U.S. Holder that makes a Mark-to-Market Election will be allowed a deduction
	in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Common Shares over (ii) the
	fair market value of such Common Shares (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of
	the Mark-to-Market Election for prior tax years).




	 




	U.S. Holders that
	make a Mark-to-Market Election generally also will adjust their tax basis in the Common Shares to reflect the amount included
	in gross income or allowed as a deduction because of such Mark-to-Market Election. In addition, upon a sale or other taxable disposition
	of Common Shares, a U.S. Holder that makes a Mark-to-Market Election will recognize ordinary income or loss (not to exceed the
	excess, if any, of (a) the amount included in ordinary income because of such Mark-to-Market Election for prior tax years
	over (b) the amount allowed as a deduction because of such Mark-to-Market Election for prior tax years).




	 




	A Mark-to-Market
	Election applies to the tax year in which such Mark-to-Market Election is made and to each subsequent tax year, unless the Common
	Shares cease to be “marketable stock” or the IRS consents to revocation of such election. U.S. Holders should consult
	their own tax advisors regarding the availability of, and procedure for making, a Mark-to-Market Election.




	 




	Although a U.S.
	Holder may be eligible to make a Mark-to-Market Election with respect to Common Shares, no such election may be made with respect
	to the stock of any Subsidiary PFIC that a U.S. Holder is treated as owning because such stock is not marketable. Hence, the Mark-to-Market
	Election will not be effective to eliminate the interest charge described above with respect to deemed dispositions of Subsidiary
	PFIC stock or distributions from a Subsidiary PFIC.




	 






	65






	 






	 






	Other
	PFIC Rules





	 




	Under Section 1291(f)
	of the Code, the IRS has issued proposed Treasury Regulations that, subject to certain exceptions, would cause a U.S. Holder that
	had not made a timely QEF Election to recognize gain (but not loss) upon certain transfers of Common Shares that would otherwise
	be tax-deferred (e.g., gifts and exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganizations) in the event the Company is a PFIC during such
	U.S. Holder’s holding period for the relevant shares. However, the specific U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S.
	Holder may vary based on the manner in which Common Shares are transferred.




	 




	Certain additional
	adverse rules will apply with respect to a U.S. Holder if the Company is a PFIC, regardless of whether such U.S. Holder makes
	a QEF Election. For example, under Section 1298(b)(6) of the Code, a U.S. Holder that uses Common Shares as security for
	a loan will, except as may be provided in Treasury Regulations, be treated as having made a taxable disposition of such Common
	Shares.




	 




	In any year in
	which the Company is classified as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder will be required to file an annual report with the IRS containing such
	information as Treasury Regulations and/or other IRS guidance may require. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
	regarding the requirements of filing such information returns under these rules, including the requirement to file an IRS Form
	8621.




	 




	In addition, a
	U.S. Holder who acquires Common Shares from a decedent will not receive a “step up” in tax basis of such Common Shares
	to fair market value unless such decedent had a timely and effective QEF Election in place.




	 




	Special rules also
	apply to the amount of foreign tax credit that a U.S. Holder may claim on a distribution from a PFIC.




	 




	The PFIC rules
	are complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the PFIC rules and how they may affect the U.S.
	federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Common Shares in the event the Company is a
	PFIC at any time during such holding period for such Common Shares.





	 






	Information
	Reporting, Backup Withholding Tax





	 




	Certain U.S. Holders
	are required to report information relating to an interest in Common Shares subject to certain exceptions (including an exception
	for Common Shares held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions), by attaching a completed IRS Form 8938, Statement
	of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, with their tax return for each year in which they hold an interest in Common Shares. U.S.
	Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to their ownership of
	Common Shares.




	 




	Payments made within
	the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, of dividends on Common Shares, and proceeds arising from certain sales
	or other taxable dispositions of Common Shares, may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax, at the rate
	of 28%, if a U.S. Holder (a) fails to furnish such U.S. Holder’s correct U.S. social security or other taxpayer identification
	number (generally on Form W-9); (b) furnishes an incorrect U.S. taxpayer identification number; (c) is notified by the
	IRS that such U.S. Holder has previously failed to properly report items subject to backup withholding tax; or (d) fails
	under certain circumstances to certify, under penalty of perjury, that such U.S. Holder has furnished its correct U.S. taxpayer
	identification number and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding tax. However,
	U.S. Holders that are corporations generally are excluded from these information reporting and backup withholding tax rules. Any
	amounts withheld under the U.S. backup withholding tax rules will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal
	income tax liability, if any, or will be refunded, if such U.S. Holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS. U.S.
	Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the information reporting and backup withholding tax rules.

	Description
	of business




	 




	We are a base metals
	exploration company focused on exploring and developing our mineral holdings in the Ambler mining district located in Alaska,
	U.S.A. We conduct our operations through a wholly-owned subsidiary, NovaCopper US Inc. which is doing business as Trilogy Metals
	US (“NovaCopper US”). Our Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, (“UKMP” or “UKMP Projects”), consist
	of: i) the 100% owned Ambler lands which host the Arctic copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver Project; and ii) the Bornite lands being
	explored under a collaborative long-term agreement with NANA Regional Corporation, Inc. (“NANA”), a regional Alaska
	Native Corporation, which host the Bornite carbonate-hosted copper Project.




	 




	Property
	review




	 




	Our
	principal assets, the UKMP Projects, are located in the Ambler mining district in Northwest Alaska. Our UKMP Projects comprise
	approximately 352,943 acres (142,831 hectares) consisting of the Ambler and Bornite lands.




	 




	Arctic
	Project




	 




	The Ambler lands,
	which host a number of deposits, including the high-grade copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver Arctic Project, and other mineralized targets
	within a 100 kilometer long volcanogenic massive sulfide (“VMS”) belt, are owned by NovaCopper US. The Ambler lands
	are located in Northwestern Alaska and consist of 112,058 acres (45,348 hectares) of Federal patented mining claims and State
	of Alaska mining claims, within which VMS mineralization has been found.




	 




	We have recorded
	the Ambler lands as a mineral property with acquisition costs capitalized and exploration costs expensed in accordance with our
	accounting policies. As a result of the spin-out of Trilogy from

	N

	ovaGold Resources
	Inc. (“NovaGold”) in 2012, the consolidated financial statements have been presented under the continuity of interest
	basis of accounting whereby the amounts are based on the amounts originally recorded by

	N

	ovaGold
	as if we had held the property from inception.




	 






	68






	 





	 




	Bornite
	Project




	 




	On October 19,
	2011, NovaCopper US and NANA signed a collaborative agreement to explore and develop the Ambler mining district. Under the Exploration
	Agreement and Option to Lease (the “NANA Agreement”), we acquired the exclusive right to explore the Bornite property
	and lands deeded to NANA through the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (“ANCSA”), located adjacent to the Arctic
	Project, and the non-exclusive right to access and entry onto NANA’s lands. The agreement establishes a framework for any
	future development of either the Bornite Project or the Arctic Project. Both projects are included as part of a larger area of
	interest set forth in the NANA Agreement. The agreement with NANA created a total land package incorporating our Ambler lands
	with the adjacent Bornite and ANCSA lands with a total area of approximately 352,900 acres (142,831 hectares).




	 




	As consideration,
	$4.0 million was paid to NANA upon signing the NANA agreement and we gave NANA the right to appoint a member to Trilogy’s
	board of directors before April 2017. NANA has not exercised their right to appoint a board member at this time. Upon the decision
	to proceed with development of a mine within the area of interest, NANA maintains the right to purchase an ownership interest
	in the mine equal to between 16%-25% or retain a 15% net proceeds royalty which is payable after we have recovered certain historical
	costs, including capital and cost of capital. Should NANA elect to purchase an ownership interest in the mine, consideration will
	be payable based on the elected percentage purchased and all the costs incurred on the properties less $40.0 million, not
	to be less than zero. The parties would form a joint venture and be responsible for all future costs incurred in connection with
	the mine, including capital costs of the mine, based on each party’s pro-rata share.




	 




	NANA would also
	be granted a net smelter return royalty between 1% and 2.5% upon the execution of a mining lease or a surface use agreement, the
	amount of which is determined by the particular area of land from which production originates.




	 




	We have accounted
	for the Bornite property as a mineral property with acquisition costs capitalized and exploration costs expensed in accordance
	with our accounting policies.




	 




	Titiribi
	Project




	 




	On June 19, 2015,
	Trilogy completed an arrangement to acquire Sunward Resources Ltd. (“Sunward”). As a result, Trilogy, through wholly-owned
	subsidiaries, Sunward Investments Ltd. (“Sunward Investments”), owned 100% of the Titiribi gold-copper exploration
	project located approximately 70 kilometers southwest of the city of Medellin, in Antioquia Department, Colombia. The Titiribi
	project’s principal mining title is concession 5085, which was created by the consolidation of five concessions and four
	exploration licenses. This concession, comprising of an area of 3,919 hectares, was registered with the National Mining Registry
	on April 18, 2013 and expires in 2043.




	 




	Following the announcement
	of the sale of Sunward Investments (see “Corporate developments – Sale of Sunward Investments Ltd.”), and its
	ownership of the Titiribi project, we have accounted for it as a discontinued operation. The financial results have been adjusted
	retrospectively for the treatment as a discontinued operation.




	 




	Corporate
	developments





	 






	Name Change 




	 


	In September 2016, we changed our name
	to Trilogy Metals Inc. to better reflect our Company’s naturally diversified resource base. The UKMP is located in the Ambler
	mining district in Northwest Alaska; a region known to host deposits rich in copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver. The Company controls
	the mineral rights to approximately 353,000 acres of land containing two known mineral belts, the Ambler Schist Belt and the Bornite
	Carbonate Sequence. The Ambler Schist Belt hosts VMS type mineralization occurring as a series of high-grade polymetallic copper-lead-zinc-gold-silver
	deposits along the entire 100 kilometer (70 mile) long belt. The Bornite Carbonate Sequence hosts several copper replacement targets
	around the Aurora and Pardner Hill prospects, in addition to an established resource identified at Bornite. Mineralization at Bornite
	is open to further exploration. Upon opening of the markets on September 8, 2016, our shares began trading on the TSX and the NYSE-MKT
	under the symbol “TMQ”. Shareholders approved the name change to Trilogy at our annual and special meeting of shareholders
	held on May 18, 2016.









	69






	 






	 






	Sale of Sunward
	Investments






	 





	On September 1, 2016, Trilogy completed the sale of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Sunward
	Investments to Brazil Resources Inc. (“BRI”) for consideration of 5,000,000 common shares of BRI, of which 2,500,000
	common shares are subject to a six month holding period, and 1,000,000 BRI warrants, with each warrant exercisable into one common
	share of BRI for a period of two years from the completion date at an exercise price of CDN$3.50. The total consideration was valued
	at approximately $8.1 million. Sunward Investments, through a subsidiary, owns 100% of the Titiribi gold-copper exploration project.
	On December 7, 2016 BRI changed its name to GoldMining Inc.




	 




	The Company reclassified
	the operations of Sunward Investments as a discontinued operation, retrospectively, and recognized a gain on the sale of $4.4
	million in the fourth quarter of 2016.





	 






	Long-term incentives





	 




	During the year
	ended November 30, 2016, the Board of Directors approved the granting of 1,785,000 stock options to employees, consultants and
	directors with various vesting terms over two years and 600,000 restricted share units (“RSUs”) to officers vesting
	equally in thirds on the grant date, the first anniversary of the grant date, and the second anniversary of the grant date.




	 




	Project
	activities




	 




	In the spring of
	2016 we announced the release of an updated resource estimate and National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report on the Bornite Project.
	The update incorporated a new 3D lithology, alteration and structural model for the Bornite deposit, as well as results from previously
	un-sampled or partially sampled historical Kennecott drill core. A positive update with contained copper in Indicated Resources
	increasing from 334 to 913 million pounds constituting a 173% increase in contained metal. Total contained copper in Inferred
	Resources decreased from 5.7 to 5.5 billion pounds (1.8Blbs in-pit and 3.7Blbs below-pit) which constitutes a 4% decrease in contained
	metal due principally to moving in-pit Inferred Resources to the Indicated category. We continue to evaluate geological and hydrogeological
	data to support internal desktop evaluations and planning of future field investigations at the Bornite project.




	 




	In fiscal 2016,
	we expended $5.0 million on the UKMP Projects, mainly at Arctic, consisting of $1.3 million in wages and benefits, $0.7 million
	in drilling, $0.7 million in engineering expenses, $1.3 million in project support expenses, $0.4 million in land maintenance
	and permit expenses, and $0.3 million in environmental studies. The Company completed another successful field season in 2016
	advancing the Arctic deposit towards pre-feasibility. We accomplished a 3,058 meter drill program at the Arctic Project, significant
	baseline environmental data collection, and furthered the engineering of the project. The summer field season was completed on
	time and 10% under budget, with a total spend of $5.0 million in 2016. The 2016 drill program was designed to collect data for
	geotechnical, hydrological, waste rock characterization and metallurgical studies as well as further resource definition.




	 




	Three drill holes
	representing 822 meters drilled were designed to collect geotechnical and hydrological data within the proposed Arctic open-pit.
	Data collected from the geotechnical/hydrological drill program was used to update a 3D structure model, rock mass model, and
	hydrogeology model and these results have been integrated into a combined geotechnical model that will be used for characterization
	of geotechnical domains and slope stability evaluation in a future pre-feasibility study.




	 




	Four drill holes
	representing 1,030 meters drilled were designed to collect metallurgical samples, specifically targeting material within the initial
	production years of the Arctic open-pit. A metallurgical test work program is currently underway and expected to be complete in
	Q1-2017.




	 




	Six drill holes
	representing 1,206 meters drilled were designed to evaluate vertical and lateral continuity of the high grade polymetallic copper,
	gold, silver, lead, and zinc mineralization, and support upgrading of Inferred resources to Measured and Indicated resource classification
	within the area of the proposed Arctic open-pit. We are pleased to announce that all six infill holes encountered mineralized
	intervals consistent with previous drilling conducted within the resource area on the property. Data collected from the drill
	program was used to update the 3D geology model. The updated geology domains and drill data will be incorporated into an updated
	resource estimate that will support a future pre-feasibility study.

	Substantial field
	work was also completed to support the continuation of baseline environmental data collection. During the course of the field
	season, data collection was completed to support an aquatic survey, an avian and large mammal habitat survey, an archaeological
	survey and expansion of the wetlands delineation and surface quality work. An aquatics survey of rivers and creeks over the UKMP
	included identification of fish species present and tissues metals testing. An avian survey over the UKMP was conducted in May
	to identify bird nest locations, with a follow-up survey in July to measure fledging success. A habitat survey was completed in
	conjunction with the wetlands survey and will be used to inform future biological surveys. Approximately 2,400 acres were surveyed
	for archaeological resources in or around the potential Arctic open-pit and facilities locations. Approximately 2,900 acres of
	wetlands were delineated using techniques approved by the Army Corps of Engineers. On-going baseline environmental data collection
	included maintenance of three hydrologic gauging stations and one meteorological station. Surface water quality samples were taken
	from sixteen surface water locations and analyzed for a full suite of parameters including total and dissolved metals.




	 




	We continue to
	advance the acid-base-accounting static and kinetic test work at Arctic. Continuous down-hole samples were collected from this
	year’s drill program to support static testing coverage over the Arctic deposit. On-site barrel sampling was successfully
	completed in the spring and fall of 2016 to support the kinetics program, and in August we achieved the 40-week milestone for
	the parallel laboratory humidity cells; maintenance and monitoring of all kinetic tests will continue into 2017.




	 




	The LiDAR survey
	that was incomplete last year due to weather conditions was also completed during the summer. Final deliverables were received
	this fall has have already proven helpful in supporting on-going engineering design and geological modeling.




	 







	We continued our efforts on supporting
	the Alaska Industrial Development Export Authority ("AIDEA”) throughout 2016 towards drafting an Environmental Impact
	Statement (“EIS”) as prescribed under the National Environmental Policy Act process to permit the Ambler Mining District
	Industrial Access Project (“AMDIAP”). The AMDIAP is anticipated to provide surface access to the Ambler mining district
	and our UKMP Projects – Arctic and Bornite. The project design is modeled on AIDEA’s successful DeLong Mountain Transportation
	System (“DMTS”), which includes an industrial access road from the Red Dog Mine to the DMTS port. AIDEA worked with
	private industry to develop the DMTS industrial access road, and the costs of road construction were paid back through tolls on
	road use. AMDIAP, once complete, will provide access to the Ambler Mining District through Gates of the Arctic National Preserve.
	This access is guaranteed in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (“ANILCA”).

	 




	 



	On October 21, 2015, Alaska’s Governor
	authorized AIDEA to begin the EIS process and shortly thereafter, the Consolidated SF299 ANILCA applications were submitted by
	AIDEA to the relevant federal agencies, including the National Park Service (“NPS”), the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers
	(“USACE”), Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”), and the U.S. Federal
	Highway Administration (“FHWA”). NPS, USACE, BLM, and FHWA have accepted the application to move forward and have determined
	that BLM will be the lead federal agency for the EIS, along with NPS taking the lead on the Environmental and Economic Analysis
	(“EEA”) per ANILCA Section 201.4(d). A project kickoff meeting with State of Alaska and Federal agencies was held in
	early December 2016 to discuss next steps which include the scope of work for the third party EIS contractor, anticipated timing
	of BLM issuance of the Notice of Intent between March 2017 and May 2017, and NPS and FHWA working on the EEA. More information
	on the AMDIAP and the ANILCA permitting process is available on AIDEA’s website at www.ambleraccess.org, which website is
	not incorporated by reference.







	 




	Outlook




	 




	In 2017, we will
	continue to advance the development of our UKMP Projects. We are currently working on incorporating new surface mapping, a LiDAR
	survey, and drill hole information into an updated 3D geology model for the Arctic deposit. The new 3D geology model will update
	structural, lithology, mineralization and alteration domains into an integrated geology model that can support pre-feasibility
	level resource evaluations and mine planning. In the first quarter of 2017, we expect to complete a resource model update for
	the Arctic project that will include new assays collected from 2015 and 2016 drill core, specific gravity determinations collected
	from waste and mineralized material, and ABA static analyses collected from the hanging wall of the Arctic deposit – these
	data will support upgrading of Inferred resources to Measured and Indicated resource classification as well as future pre-feasibility
	level mine planning and open-pit design. During summer 2016, five drill holes were completed at the Arctic project to support
	a pre-feasibility level metallurgical test program. We retained ALS Metallurgy of Kamloops, British Columbia to complete the test
	work. The study will include confirmation of the metallurgical response of a Master Composite of approximately 400 kilograms,
	assessment of the variance in metallurgical responses across the deposit, and completion of copper-lead separation testing –
	work is on-going and expected to continue into the second quarter of 2017. We continue to advance our understanding of ABA/ML
	waste characterization at the Arctic project, in support of this task we plan to continue monthly sampling of laboratory Humidity
	Cell Tests through the end of 2017.

	During summer 2013,
	two drill holes were completed in the open-pittable Ruby Creek zone of the Bornite deposit; the core was logged as per Company
	standard logging procedures, sampled and shipped to the Fairbanks warehouse where samples remained in cold storage pending processing.
	In September 2016, we retained SGS Minerals Services of Burnaby, British Columbia to perform a mineralogical and metallurgical
	test program for the retained samples of the open pit zone of the Bornite deposit. The study will include mineralogical characterization
	through quantitative analysis (QEMSCAN) and optimization of the metallurgical parameters to best recover the base and precious
	metal values in the mineralized material – work is on-going and expected to continue into the second quarter of 2017. In
	November 2016, we retained SRK Consulting of Vancouver, British Columbia to review hydrogeological conditions at the Bornite property,
	update the hydrogeological conceptual model and provide recommendations for future data collection – work is on-going and
	expected to continue into the second quarter of 2017.




	 




	In the first half
	of 2017, we expect to complete a number of stand-alone and district trade-off studies that will include updated information on
	the Arctic and Bornite projects. These trade-off studies will guide planning of future site investigations to support pre-feasibility.




	 



	We continue to work with NANA on workforce
	development within NANA’s region. Through the Oversight Committee and the Workforce Development sub-committee, NANA and
	the Company jointly work on programs to facilitate local hiring of NANA shareholders. The Company has contributed a total of $140,000
	to a scholarship fund which grants awards to NANA shareholders for either (i) the recipient’s student expenses directly
	related to education, i.e., academic education at an accredited institution; or (ii) the recipient’s student expenses directly
	related to vocational or technical schooling or training at a recognized institution intended to qualify the recipient for enhanced
	employment opportunities. The Workforce Development sub-committee which consists of equal representation from NANA and the Company
	will review all applications for 2017 and will select recipients for grant awards. We are committed to training and hiring locally.
	We have been very successful in hiring NANA shareholders at the UKMP Projects, achieving over 50% local hire each year over the
	past 5 years. In 2016, our field season employees consisted of 55% NANA shareholders and in 2017, we are committed to the continuation
	of hiring locally at the project.


	 


	We are also working closely with AIDEA
	to amend the Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) , originally signed in 2013, as the industrial road route has been
	selected and permitting documents have been submitted to the relevant US federal agencies. We will work with AIDEA, as the proponent
	for the AMDIAP, to have a direct input into the permitting process for the road and have the ability to attend meetings with the
	BLM, as the lead federal agency for the EIS process.

	For the year ended
	November 30, 2016, we reported a net loss of $4.9 million (or $0.05 basic and diluted loss per common share) compared to
	a net loss for the corresponding period in 2015 of $9.5 million (or $0.12 basic and diluted loss per common share) and a net loss
	of $9.6 million for the corresponding period in 2014 (or $0.17 basic and diluted loss per common share). This variance was
	primarily due to a one-time gain on the sale of Sunward Investments. Additionally, there were decreases in annual professional
	fees and stock-based compensation expense offset against an increase in mineral properties expenses in 2016. 



	 


	The significant variance in 2016 relates
	to the gain recognized on the sale of Sunward Investments and the Titiribi Project of $4.4 million, pre-tax. This was a one-time
	event for which there is no comparable gain in prior years. Additionally, as a result of the sale, the operations of Sunward Investments
	were reclassified as a discontinued operation, retrospectively. Expenses of $0.6 million for the year ended November 30, 2016
	and $0.4 million for the year ended November 30, 2015 related to the Sunward Investments operations were reclassified to discontinued
	operations. As Sunward was purchased by the Company in June 2015, there are no amounts prior to June 2015 included in the consolidated
	results. In addition to the gain recognized on the sale, we also realized $0.1 million in gains on the sale of investments received
	as consideration for the year ended November 30, 2016.


	 


	Professional fees for the year ended November
	30, 2016 were $0.4 million, a reduction of $0.9 million from the $1.3 million incurred for the year ended November 30, 2015, and
	a reduction from the $1.0 million incurred for the year ended November 30, 2014. Expenses in 2016 were down significantly due to
	less corporate transaction activity as well as $0.2 million in costs related to the sale of Sunward recorded in discontinued operations.
	In 2015, expenses were incurred for legal and technical due diligence and regulatory approvals associated with the acquisition
	of Sunward and, in 2014, legal costs associated with private placement financing were incurred for which there is no comparable
	amount in the current year.





	 




	The variance in
	the mineral properties expense was primarily due to the differing magnitude of the field programs at our UKMP Project in 2016,
	2015 and 2014. In 2016, we completed a similar-sized drill program consisting of 3,058 meters at the Arctic Project, however,
	we significantly increased the environmental baseline data collection and engineering site investigations compared to the 2015
	program. In 2015, we completed fourteen diamond drill holes amounting to 3,056 meters at the Arctic Project, as well as engineering
	and environmental site investigations. In 2014, we completed a re-sampling and re-assaying program of approximately 13,000 meters
	of historical drill core from Bornite. Mineral property expenses consist of direct drilling, personnel, community, resource reporting
	and other exploration expenses, as well as indirect project support expenses such as fixed wing charters, helicopter support,
	fuel, and other camp operation costs.




	 




	The other reduction
	in expenses is from a charge of $0.6 million in stock-based compensation in 2016 compared to $0.8 million in 2015, and $0.9 million
	in 2014. The expense recognized for the current year includes $0.4 million in expense relating to stock options and $0.3 million
	in expense relating to RSUs and deferred share units (“DSUs”). The 2015 expense included $0.7 million in expense relating
	to stock options and $0.1 million in expense relating to DSUs issued to non-executive directors in lieu of cash remuneration.
	The expense recognized for 2014 included $0.5 million in expense relating to stock options and $0.4 million in expense relating
	to previously granted RSUs and DSUs.




	 






	73






	 





	 




	Other important
	variances for the year ended November 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and 2014 are as follows: (a) $1.3 million in
	general and administrative expenses in 2016 and 2015 compared to $1.5 million in due to cost reduction efforts as well as a favorable
	foreign exchange movement; and (b) $1.0 million in salaries in 2016 compared to $1.1 million in 2015 and $3.0 million in 2014
	primarily related to cost reduction initiatives implemented in the third quarter of 2014 that reduced the number of employees
	in the corporate office. The salaries in 2014 also included a one-time severance cost of $1.3 million paid to former employees
	offset by a recovery of $0.3 million due to a reversal of accrued bonuses from 2013 to employees no longer eligible to receive
	payment.




	 




	The comparable
	basic and diluted loss per common share for 2016 is lower than 2015 and 2014 due to the gain on the sale of Sunward Investments.
	The 2015 basic and diluted loss per common share is lower than 2014 mainly as a result of the additional shares issued during
	2015 as a result of the Sunward acquisition completed in June 2015 as well as a lower loss figure.




	 




	Fourth
	quarter results




	 




	During the fourth
	quarter of 2016, we earned income of $2.0 million compared to a net loss of $2.1 million for the comparable period in 2015. The
	earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 were due to the gain on sale of Sunward Investments of $4.4 million offsetting net expenses
	of $2.4 million. We incurred $1.4 million of mineral property expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $0.8 million
	in the fourth quarter of 2015 for fairly comparable expenses including assaying costs from the summer drill program and engineering
	costs for the Arctic deposit. We recognized $0.2 million in foreign exchange losses in the fourth quarter of 2016 mainly due to
	the movement of the Canadian dollar as a result of holding the investments in BRI. As we acquired the investments in the fourth
	quarter of 2016, there is no comparable amount in 2015.

	Factors that can
	cause fluctuations in our quarterly results include the length of the exploration field season at the properties, the type of
	program conducted, stock option vesting, and issuance of shares. Other factors that have caused fluctuations in the quarterly
	results that would not be expected to re-occur include the acquisition and disposition of Sunward and financing activities.




	 




	Our loss for the
	first quarter ended February 28, 2015 was significantly reduced in comparison to previous first quarter periods due to the Company’s
	cost cutting efforts to reduce professional fees, salaries and mineral property expenses. During the first quarter of 2015, we
	incurred mineral property expense of $0.3 million mainly on community support and project staff salaries as our field season this
	year did not commence until early in the third quarter. During the second quarter of 2015, we incurred $0.3 million in mineral
	property expenses, the same level of activities as the first quarter of 2015. We also incurred $0.7 million in professional fees
	during the second quarter of 2015 mainly due to the acquisition of Sunward. During the third quarter of 2015, we incurred mineral
	property expenses of $2.8 million as we completed our drilling program. We also incurred $0.2 million of discontinued operation
	costs operating Sunward. As a result, our loss for the third quarter ended August 31, 2015 is higher compared to previous quarter
	losses. Our net loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $2.1 million consists of $0.8 million in mineral property expenses incurred
	for assay costs and engineering studies conducted in the fall as well as $0.2 million in discontinued operation costs from Sunward.




	 




	Our loss for the
	first quarter ended February 28, 2016 is slightly increased compared to the first quarter ended February 28, 2015 due to increased
	mineral property expenses relating to engineering studies completed in advance of the 2016 field program, as well as costs related
	to operating Sunward. During the second quarter of 2016, we incurred $0.5 million in mineral property expenses due to field season
	starting up in the last month of the second quarter and $0.2 million in discontinued operations relating to Sunward. During the
	third quarter of 2016, we incurred mineral property expenses of $2.6 million as we completed our drilling program. As a result,
	our loss for the third quarter ended August 31, 2016 is higher compared to previous third quarter losses. We recognized earnings
	for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $2.0 million due to the gain on the sale of Sunward. Adjusted for the discontinued operations,
	the fourth quarter periods are comparable.




	 




	Liquidity
	and capital resources




	 




	At November 30, 2016,
	we had $7.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. We expended $8.9 million on operating activities during the 2016 fiscal
	year compared with $8.4 million for operating activities for the same period in 2015, and expenditures of $8.6 million for
	operating activities for the same period in 2014. A majority of cash spent on operating activities during all periods was expended
	on mineral property expenses, professional fees, salaries and general and administrative expenses. The increase in cash spent
	in the year ended November 30, 2016 is mainly due to increased mineral property expenses of $0.9 million, increased discontinued
	operations expense of $0.2 million expended on Sunward offset by decreased professional fees of $0.9 million. As at November 30,
	2016, the Company continues to manage its cash expenditures and management believes that the working capital available is sufficient
	to meet its operational requirements for the next year. Future financings are anticipated through equity financing, debt financing,
	the sale of investments, convertible debt, or other means.




	 




	During the year
	ended November 30, 2014, we raised $7.2 million in proceeds from the completion of a private placement in July 2014. There was
	no comparable amount from financing activities in 2015 or 2016.




	 




	During the year
	ended November 30, 2016, we raised $0.2 million in sales from investments acquired through the sale of Sunward Investments. During
	the year ended November 30, 2015, we generated $19.4 million from investing activities through the acquisition of Sunward. There
	was no comparable amount from investing activities in 2014. In 2014 and 2015, to conserve cash, our expenditures were minimal
	and limited to replacements that were absolutely necessary. In 2016, we spent $0.1 million purchasing vehicles and equipment to
	replace older vehicles.

	At February 2, 2017, we had
	105,501,761 common shares issued and outstanding. At February 2, 2017, we had outstanding 6,521,740 warrants with an exercise
	price of $1.60 each, 7,562,765 stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $0.53, 958,648 DSUs, 600,002 RSUs,
	66,664 NovaGold Arrangement Options with a weighted-average exercise price of $3.91, and 20,685 NovaGold DSUs for which the
	holder is entitled to receive one common share for every six NovaGold shares received. For additional information on NovaGold
	Arrangement Options and NovaGold DSUs, please refer to note 8 in our November 30, 2016 audited consolidated financial
	statements. Upon exercising all of forgoing convertible securities, the Company would be required to issue an aggregate of
	15,713,266 common shares.



	 




	Financial
	instruments




	 




	Our financial instruments
	consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits, investments, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
	The fair value of the financial instruments approximates their carrying value due to the short-term nature of their maturity.
	Our financial instruments initially measured at fair value and then held at amortized cost include cash and cash equivalents,
	accounts receivable, deposits, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Our investments are held for trading and are marked-to-market
	at each period end with changes in fair value recorded to the statement of loss.




	 








	(a)




	Currency
	risk






	 




	Currency risk is
	the risk of a fluctuation in financial asset and liability settlement amounts due to a change in foreign exchange rates. We operate
	in the United States, Canada, and previously operated in Colombia with some expenses incurred in Canadian dollars and Colombian
	pesos. Our exposure to currency risk at November 30, 2016 is limited to the Canadian dollar consisting of cash of CDN$451,000,
	accounts receivable of CDN$32,000, deposits amounts of CDN$146,000, investments of CDN$10,521,000 and accounts payable of CDN$528,000.
	Based on a 1% change in the US-Canadian exchange rate, assuming all other variables remain constant, the Company’s net loss
	would change by approximately $79,000.




	 








	(b)




	Credit
	risk






	 




	Credit risk is
	the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
	The Company holds cash and cash equivalents with Canadian Chartered financial institutions. The Company’s accounts receivable
	consist of GST receivable from the Federal Government of Canada and other receivables for recoverable expenses. The Company’s
	exposure to credit risk is equal to the balance of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable as recorded in the financial
	statements.




	 








	(c)




	Liquidity
	risk






	 




	Liquidity risk
	is the risk that we will encounter difficulties raising funds to meet our financial obligations as they fall due. The Company
	does not have cash inflows from operations; therefore, the Company manages liquidity risk through the management of our capital
	structure and financial leverage. Future financings may be obtained through debt financing, equity financing, sales of investments,
	convertible debt, exercise of options, or other means. Continued operations are dependent on our ability to obtain additional
	financing or to generate future cash flows. Our contractually obligated cash flow is disclosed under the section titled “Liquidity
	and capital resources.”




	 






	76






	 





	 








	(d)




	Interest
	rate risk






	 




	Interest rate risk
	is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest
	rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents. Based on balances
	as at November 30, 2016, a 1% change in interest rates would result in a change in net loss of $0.1 million, assuming all other
	variables remain constant.




	 




	As we are currently
	in the exploration phase none of our financial instruments are exposed to commodity price risk; however, our ability to obtain
	long-term financing and its economic viability could be affected by commodity price volatility.




	 




	New
	accounting pronouncements




	 




	Certain recent
	accounting pronouncements have been included under note 2 in our November 30, 2016 audited consolidated financial statements




	 




	Critical
	accounting estimates




	 




	The most critical
	accounting estimates upon which our financial status depends are those requiring estimates of the recoverability of our capitalized
	mineral properties, impairment of long-lived assets, accounting for business combinations, income taxes and valuation of stock-based
	compensation.




	 




	Mineral
	properties and development costs




	 




	All direct costs
	related to the acquisition of mineral property interests are capitalized. The acquisition of title to mineral properties is a
	complicated and uncertain process. The Company has taken steps, in accordance with industry standards, to verify the title to
	mineral properties in which it has an interest. Although the Company has made efforts to ensure that legal title to its mining
	assets is properly recorded, there can be no assurance that such title will be secured indefinitely.




	 




	Impairment
	of long-lived assets




	 




	Management assesses
	the possibility of impairment in the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
	carrying amounts of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Significant judgments are made in assessing the possibility
	of impairment. Management considers several factors in considering if an indicator of impairment has occurred, including but not
	limited to, indications of value from external sources, significant changes in the legal, business or regulatory environment,
	and adverse changes in the use of physical condition of the asset. These factors are subjective and require consideration at each
	period end. If an indicator of impairment is determined to exist, management calculates the estimated undiscounted future net
	cash flows relating to the asset or asset group using estimated future prices, mineral resources, and operating, capital and reclamation
	costs. When the carrying value of an asset exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated
	fair value, which is usually determined using discounted future cash flows. Management’s estimates of mineral prices, mineral
	resources, foreign exchange rates, production levels and operating capital and reclamation costs are subject to risk and uncertainties
	that may affect the determination of the recoverability of the long-lived asset.




	 




	Income
	taxes




	 




	We must make estimates
	and judgments in determining the provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized
	tax benefits including interest and penalties. We are subject to income tax law in the United States, Canada and previously in
	Colombia. The evaluation of tax liabilities involving uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulation is based on factors
	such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. The evaluation
	of an uncertain tax position requires significant judgment, and a change in such recognition would result in an additional charge
	to the income tax expense and liability.




	 




	Stock-based
	compensation




	 




	Compensation expense
	for options granted to employees, directors and certain service providers is determined based on estimated fair values of the
	options at the time of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which takes into account, as of the grant date, the
	fair market value of the shares, expected volatility, expected life, expected forfeiture rate, expected dividend yield and the
	risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires input
	estimation of the expected life of the option, volatility, and forfeiture rate which can have a significant impact on the valuation
	model, and resulting expense recorded.




	 






	77






	 





	 




	Disclosure
	controls and procedures




	 




	Disclosure controls
	and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted by the Company under
	U.S. and Canadian securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
	those rules, including providing reasonable assurance that material information is gathered and reported to senior management,
	including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to
	permit timely decisions regarding public disclosure. Management, including the CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of
	the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
	of the US Exchange Act and the rules of Canadian Securities Administration, as at November 30, 2016. Based on this
	evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.




	 




	Internal
	control over financial reporting




	 




	Management is responsible
	for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
	of the U.S. Exchange Act and National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim
	filings. Any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore,
	even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
	and presentation. Management has used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control
	– Integrated Framework (2013) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
	Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as at November 30, 2016, the Company’s internal control
	over financial reporting was effective.

	Management’s
	Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 




	The management
	of Trilogy Metals Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting under
	Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the U.S. Exchange Act. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 defines this as a process designed
	by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the
	Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
	of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles in the United States of America, and includes those policies and procedures that:




	 








	·




	pertain
	to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
	the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;










	·




	provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
	of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
	the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
	made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
	and










	·




	provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
	use or disposition of the Company’s assets that may have a material effect on the
	consolidated financial statements.






	 




	Because of its
	inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
	of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
	that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	 




	Management assessed
	the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2016. In making this
	assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
	Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).




	 




	Based upon our
	assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective
	as of November 30, 2016.

	Report
	of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm





	 






	To the Shareholders
	of Trilogy Metals Inc. (formerly known as NovaCopper Inc.)





	 




	We have
	audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trilogy Metals Inc. as of November 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related
	consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
	years in the three-year period ended November 30, 2016. Management is responsible for these consolidated financial
	statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
	audits.




	 




	We conducted our
	audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
	that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free
	of material misstatement. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
	estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We were not engaged to
	perform an audit of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
	control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
	for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting.
	Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
	in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.




	 




	In our opinion,
	the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Trilogy
	Metals Inc. as of November 30, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
	three-year period ended November 30, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America.

	Notes to the Consolidated

	1




	Nature of operations





	 


	Trilogy Metals Inc., formerly NovaCopper
	Inc., (“Trilogy” or the “Company”) was incorporated in British Columbia under the

	Business Corporations
	Act (BC)

	on April 27, 2011. The Company changed its name from NovaCopper Inc. to Trilogy Metals Inc. on September
	1, 2016 to better reflect its diversified metals resource base. The Company is engaged in the exploration and development of mineral
	properties with a focus on the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (“UKMP”), including the Arctic and Bornite Projects located
	in Northwest Alaska in the United States of America (“US”).

	Summary of significant accounting policies





	 


	Basis of presentation


	 


	These consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and include
	the accounts of Trilogy and its wholly-owned subsidiary, NovaCopper US Inc. (“NovaCopper US”). These consolidated
	financial statements include the accounts of Sunward Resources Ltd. (“Sunward”), Sunward Investments Ltd. (“Sunward
	Investments”) and Sunward Resources Limited (“Sunward BVI”) for the period June 19, 2015 to September 1, 2016,
	as applicable. Sunward BVI has registered a branch, Sunward Resources Sucursal Colombia, to do business in Colombia. All significant
	intercompany transactions are eliminated on consolidation.


	 


	On June 19, 2015, we completed the acquisition
	of Sunward, which held 100% ownership in the Titiribi gold-copper exploration project in Colombia through Sunward Investments.
	Sunward was converted to Sunward Resources Unlimited Liability Company on June 19, 2015 and wound-up on February 29, 2016. On September
	1, 2016, we completed the sale of Sunward Investments and the Titiribi project.


	 


	All figures are in United States dollars
	unless otherwise noted. References to CDN$ refer to amounts in Canadian dollars.


	 


	These financial statements were approved
	by the Company’s Board of Directors for issue on February 2, 2017.


	 


	Cash and cash equivalents


	 


	Cash and cash equivalents comprise of highly
	liquid investments maturing less than 90 days from date of initial investment. Cash and cash equivalents are designated as
	loans and receivables.


	 


	Plant and equipment


	 


	Plant and equipment are recorded at cost
	and amortization begins when the asset is put into service. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the respective
	assets’ estimated useful lives. Amortization periods by asset class are:


	 




	Computer hardware and software


	3 years




	Machinery and equipment


	3 years




	Office furniture and equipment


	5 years




	Vehicles


	3 years




	Leasehold Improvements


	lease term




	 


	Mineral properties
	and development costs


	 


	All direct costs related to the acquisition
	of mineral property interests are capitalized. Mineral property exploration expenditures are expensed when incurred. When it has
	been established that a mineral deposit is commercially mineable, an economic analysis has been completed in accordance with SEC
	Industry Guide 7 and permits are obtained, the costs subsequently incurred to develop a mine on the property prior to the
	start of mining operations are capitalized. Capitalized costs will be amortized following commencement of production using the
	unit of production method over the estimated life of proven and probable reserves.


	 





	86






	 




	 


	The acquisition of title to mineral properties
	is a complicated and uncertain process. The Company has taken steps, in accordance with industry standards, to verify the title
	to mineral properties in which it has an interest. Although the Company has made efforts to ensure that legal titles to its mining
	assets are properly recorded, there can be no assurance that such title will be secured indefinitely.


	 


	Impairment of long-lived
	assets


	 


	Management assesses the possibility of
	impairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the
	asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Management calculates the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows relating to
	the asset or asset group using estimated future prices, proven and probable reserves and other mineral resources, and operating,
	capital and reclamation costs. When the carrying value of an asset exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset is written
	down to its estimated fair value, which is usually determined using discounted future cash flows. Management’s estimates
	of mineral prices, mineral resources, foreign exchange rates, production levels and operating capital and reclamation costs are
	subject to risk and uncertainties that may affect the determination of the recoverability of the long-lived asset. It is possible
	that material changes could occur that may adversely affect management’s estimates.


	 


	Income taxes


	 


	The liability method of accounting for
	income taxes is used and is based on differences between the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income
	tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax and accounting basis of assets and liabilities
	as well as for the benefit of losses available to be carried forward to future years for tax purposes using enacted income tax
	rates expected to be in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are
	evaluated and, if realization is not considered more likely than not, a valuation allowance is provided.


	 


	Uncertainty in income
	tax positions


	 


	The Company recognizes tax benefits from
	uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
	taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from
	such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement
	with the taxing authorities. Related interest and penalties, if any, are recorded as tax expense in the tax provision.


	 


	Financial instruments


	 


	Held-for-trading financial assets and liabilities
	are recorded at fair value as determined by active market prices or valuation models, as appropriate. Valuation models require
	the use of assumptions which may include the expected life of the instrument, the expected volatility, dividend payouts, and interest
	rates. In determining these assumptions, management uses readily observable market inputs where available or, where not available,
	inputs generated by management. Changes in fair value of held-for-trading financial instruments are recorded in income or loss
	for the period. Held-for-trading financial assets consist of common share and warrant investments in a publicly-held mining company.


	 


	Available-for-sale financial assets are
	recorded at fair value as determined by active market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are
	recognized in other comprehensive income. If a decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary, the unrealized loss
	is recognized in net earnings. Investments in equity instruments that do not have an active quoted market price are measured at
	cost. The Company has no available-for-sale financial assets.


	 


	Loans and receivables are recorded initially
	at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
	Loans and receivables consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and deposits.


	 


	Other financial liabilities are recorded
	initially at fair value and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Other financial liabilities
	include accounts payable and accrued liabilities.


	 


	Translation of foreign
	currencies


	 


	Monetary assets and liabilities are translated
	into United States dollar at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and non-monetary assets and liabilities at
	the exchange rate in effect at the time of acquisition or issue. Income and expenses are translated at rates approximating the
	exchange rate in effect at the time of transactions. Exchange gains or losses arising on translation are included in income or
	loss for the period.


	 


	The functional currency of the Company
	and its subsidiaries and the Company’s reporting currency is the United States dollar.


	 





	87






	 




	 


	Earnings and loss
	per share


	 


	Earnings and loss per common share is calculated
	based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The Company follows the treasury stock method
	in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Under the treasury stock method, the weighted average number of common shares
	outstanding used for the calculation of diluted loss per share assumes that the proceeds to be received on the exercise of dilutive
	stock options and warrants are used to repurchase common shares at the average market price during the period.


	 


	Stock-based compensation


	 


	Compensation expense for options granted
	to employees, directors and certain service providers is determined based on estimated fair values of the options at the time of
	grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which takes into account, as of the grant date, the fair market value of the
	shares, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The
	compensation cost is recognized using the graded attribution method over the vesting period of the respective options. The expense
	relating to the fair value of stock options is included in expenses and is credited to contributed surplus. Shares are issued from
	treasury in settlement of options exercised.


	 


	Compensation expense for restricted share
	units (“RSUs”) and deferred share units (“DSUs”) granted to employees and directors, respectively, is determined
	based on estimated fair values of the units at the time of grant using quoted market prices or at the time the units qualify for
	equity classification under ASC 718. The cost is recognized using the graded attribution method over the vesting period of the
	respective units. The expense relating to the fair value of the units is included in expenses and is credited to other liabilities
	or contributed surplus based on the unit’s classification. Units may be settled in either i) cash, and/or ii) shares purchased
	in the open market, and/or iii) shares issued from treasury, at the Company’s election at the time of vesting.


	 


	Use of estimates
	and measurement uncertainties


	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions of future events that affect the reported
	amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
	amounts of expenditures during the period. Significant estimates include the basis of impairment of mineral properties, accounting
	for business combinations, income taxes, and the valuation of stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ materially
	from those reported.


	 


	Accounting standards
	adopted



	 




	Development stage entity



	 


	In June 2014, the FASB issued “Development
	Stage Entities – Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities
	Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation” (“ASU 2014-10”). ASU 2014-10 eliminates the concept of a development
	stage entity, of which Trilogy had been classified. Upon adoption, certain financial reporting disclosures have been eliminated
	including the presentation of an inception-to-date statement of income and cash flow. ASU 2014-10 is effective for fiscal
	years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014. The Company adopted this standard as of December
	1, 2015. As a result of adopting the standard, the Company no longer includes the cumulative during exploration stage column previously
	presented on the statement of loss and comprehensive loss and statement of cash flows.


	 


	Recent accounting
	pronouncements



	 








	i.




	Extraordinary Items






	 



	In January 2015, the FASB issued
	guidance to eliminate the concept of extraordinary items (“ASU 2015-01”). This will mean the Company will not present
	any items as extraordinary items in the future. This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
	15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. We have assessed that there is no impact and the Company will adopt
	the standard beginning December 1, 2016.



	 






	88






	 





	 








	ii.




	Leases





	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued
	new accounting requirements for accounting for, presentation of, and classification of leases (“ASU 2016-02”). This
	will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our balance sheets. The requirements
	of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within
	those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. We expect the adoption will have an impact as we expect
	to capitalize leases that are not currently recognized on the balance sheet and are in the process of analyzing the quantitative
	impact of this guidance on our results of operations and financial position.


	 







	iii.




	Stock-based compensation





	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued
	new guidance simplifying the accounting for stock-based compensation transactions, including income tax consequences, classification
	of awards as equity or liabilities, forfeitures, and classification on the statement of cash flows (“ASU 2016-09”).
	This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. We are
	in the process of analyzing the impact of this guidance on our results of operations, financial position, and disclosures.

	Sale of Sunward Investments Ltd





	 


	On September 1, 2016, Trilogy completed
	the sale of Sunward Investments to Brazil Resources Inc. (“BRI”), a public company listed on the TSX-Venture exchange,
	of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Sunward Investments for consideration of 5,000,000 common shares of BRI valued at
	$7.8 million and 1,000,000 warrants, with each warrant exercisable into one common share of BRI for a period of two years at an
	exercise price of Cdn$3.50, valued at $0.3 million for total consideration of $8.1 million. On December 7, 2016, BRI changed its
	name to GoldMining Inc. Of the common shares received, 2,500,000 common shares were saleable immediately with the remaining 2,500,000
	common shares saleable six months following the close. Sunward Investments, through a subsidiary, owns 100% of the Titiribi gold-copper
	exploration project located approximately 70 kilometers southwest of the city of Medellin, in Antioquia Department, Colombia. Trilogy
	acquired Sunward Investments and the Titiribi project as part of its acquisition of Sunward in a business combination which closed
	on June 19, 2015 (Note 4).


	 


	The Company recognized a gain on the sale
	of Sunward Investments of $4.4 million as of September 1, 2016 as outlined below.

	Acquisition of Sunward Resources Ltd.





	 


	On June 19, 2015, the Company closed a
	definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Sunward, by way of a court-approved plan of
	arrangement (the “Sunward Arrangement”). Under the terms of the Sunward Arrangement, Sunward shareholders received
	0.3 of a Trilogy common share for each Sunward common share held. On June 19, 2015, the Company issued 43,116,312 common shares
	of Trilogy (“Common Shares”) to Sunward shareholders and holders of Sunward deferred share units pursuant to the Sunward
	Arrangement. Each Sunward stock option outstanding was exchanged for a fully-vested option (“Sunward Arrangement Option”)
	to purchase Trilogy Common Shares for a period of 90 days, with the number of shares issuable and exercise price adjusted based
	on an exchange ratio of 0.3 Trilogy options for each of Sunward’s 8,350,000 options outstanding immediately prior to completion
	of the arrangement. As a result, 2,505,000 Sunward Arrangement Options were exchanged for the Sunward options and all have subsequently
	been exercised or expired. Consideration transferred to consummate the Sunward Arrangement comprised of the issuance of 43,116,312
	Common Shares valued at $22.9 million and 2,505,000 Sunward Arrangement options valued at $0.1 million. The value of the Common
	Shares issued was calculated based on the closing price of Trilogy Common Shares on June 18, 2015 of $0.53, the date of last trading
	prior to the closing of the acquisition. The fair value of the Sunward Arrangement Options was determined using the Black-Scholes
	option pricing model.


	 


	Assumptions used in the pricing model in
	the measurement of the fair value of the Sunward Arrangement Options are as follows:


	 






	Risk-free interest rates


	 


	 


	0.62


	%




	Exercise price


	 


	 



	CDN$0.54-6.27

	0.245 years



	 




	Expected forfeiture rate


	 


	 


	0


	%




	Expected volatility


	 


	 


	50.2


	%




	Expected dividends


	 


	 



	Nil



	 





	 


	This acquisition has been accounted for
	as a business combination under ASC 805. The Company incurred $0.8 million in acquisition costs related to the Sunward Arrangement
	which are included in professional fees on the consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss for the year ended November
	30, 2015.

	(a)



	Ambler




	 


	On January 11, 2010,
	NovaGold Resources Inc. (“NovaGold”), through Alaska Gold Company (“AGC”), at the time a wholly-owned subsidiary,
	purchased 100% of the Ambler lands in Northwest Alaska, which contains the copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver Arctic Project and other
	mineralized targets within the volcanogenic massive sulfide belt, through a series of cash and share payments. Total fair value
	of the consideration was $26.6 million. The vendor retained a 1% net smelter return royalty that the owner of the property
	can purchase at any time for a one-time payment of $10.0 million.


	 


	The Ambler lands were acquired
	on October 17, 2011 by NovaCopper US through a purchase and sale agreement with AGC. On October 24, 2011, NovaGold
	transferred its ownership of NovaCopper US to the Company, then a wholly owned subsidiary of NovaGold, which was subsequently
	spun-out to NovaGold shareholders and publicly listed on April 30, 2012 (“NovaGold Arrangement”).

	(b)



	Bornite




	 


	On October 19, 2011, NovaCopper
	US acquired the exclusive right to explore and the non-exclusive right to access and enter on the Bornite lands, and lands deeded
	to NANA Regional Corporation, Inc. (“NANA”) through the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, located adjacent to the
	Ambler lands in Northwest Alaska. As consideration, NovaCopper US paid $4 million to acquire the right to explore and
	develop the combined Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects through an Exploration Agreement and Option to Lease with NANA. NANA also has
	the right to appoint a member to Trilogy’s board of directors before April 2017. NANA has not exercised their right to appoint
	a board member at this time. Upon a decision to proceed with construction of a mine on the lands, NANA maintains the right to purchase
	between a 16%-25% ownership interest in the mine or retain a 15% net proceeds royalty which is payable after NovaCopper US has
	recovered certain historical costs, including capital and cost of capital. Should NANA elect to purchase an ownership interest,
	consideration will be payable equal to all historical costs incurred on the properties at the elected percentage purchased less
	$40 million, not to be less than zero. The parties would form a joint venture and be responsible for all future costs, including
	capital costs of the mine based on their pro-rata share.


	 


	NANA would also be granted a
	net smelter return royalty of between 1% and 2.5% upon the execution of a mining lease or a surface use agreement, the amount of
	which is determined by the classification of land from which production originates.

	On April 30, 2012, under the NovaGold
	Arrangement, Trilogy committed to issue up to 6,181,352 common shares, once vested and exercised, to satisfy holders of NovaGold
	warrants (“NovaGold Warrants”), performance share units (“NovaGold PSUs”) and deferred share units (“NovaGold
	DSUs”) on record as of the close of business April 27, 2012. When exercised or vested, Trilogy committed to deliver one Common
	Share to the holder for every six shares of NovaGold the holder is entitled to receive, rounded down to the nearest whole number.
	All NovaGold Warrants have been exercised and all NovaGold PSUs have vested. As of November 30, 2016, 20,685 NovaGold DSUs remain
	outstanding representing a right to receive 3,447 Common Shares in Trilogy, which will settle upon certain directors retiring from
	NovaGold’s board, and 312,195 NovaGold Arrangement Options remain outstanding as disclosed in note 8b.


	 


	Refer to note 4 for a description of Common
	Shares issued pursuant to the Sunward Arrangement. All Sunward Arrangement Options have been exercised or expired.


	 






	(a)


	Stock options




	 


	The Company has a stock option plan providing
	for the issuance of options with a rolling maximum number equal to 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares at any given
	time. The Company may grant options to its directors, officers, employees and service providers. The exercise price of each option
	cannot be lower than the greater of market price or fair market value of the Common Shares (as such terms are defined in the plan)
	at the date of the option grant. The number of Common Shares optioned to any single optionee may not exceed 10% of the issued and
	outstanding Common Shares at the date of grant. The options are exercisable for a maximum of five years from the date of grant,
	and may be subject to vesting provisions.


	 


	During the year ended November 30, 2016,
	1,785,000 options (2015 – 3,813,350 options) at a weighted-average exercise price of CDN$0.43 (2015 - CDN$0.55) were granted
	to employees, consultants and directors exercisable for a period of five years with various vesting terms from immediate vesting
	to over a two year period. The weighted-average fair value attributable to options granted in 2016 was $0.13 (2015 - $0.17).


	 


	The fair value of the stock options recognized
	in the period has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

	The Company recognized a stock option payments
	charge of $0.4 million for the year ended November 30, 2016 (2015 - $0.7 million; 2014 - $0.5 million), net of forfeitures.


	 


	As of November 30, 2016, there were
	1,401,675 non-vested options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $0.37; the non-vested stock option expense not
	yet recognized was $0.05 million. This expense is expected to be recognized over the next two years.

	Sunward Arrangement Options




	 


	Under the Sunward Arrangement, each Sunward
	stock option outstanding was exchanged for a fully-vested Sunward Arrangement Option to purchase Trilogy Common Shares for a period
	of 90 days, such number and exercise price adjusted based on an exchange ratio of 0.3 Trilogy options for each Sunward option.
	A total of 2,505,000 options were exchanged and all were exercised or expired during the year ended November 30, 2015.


	 


	During the year ended November 30, 2015,
	347,999 Sunward Arrangement Options were exercised for proceeds of approximately CDN$188,000 (US$142,000), and 2,157,001 expired.
	The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised Sunward Arrangement Options in 2015 was $0.01 million.


	 






	(d)


	Restricted Share Units and Deferred Share Units




	 


	The Company has a Restricted Share Unit
	Plan (“RSU Plan”) and a Non-Executive Director Deferred Share Unit Plan (“DSU Plan”) to provide long-term
	incentives to employees, officers and directors. The RSU Plan and DSU Plan may be settled in cash and/or Common Shares at the Company’s
	election with each RSU and DSU entitling the holder to receive one common share of the Company or equivalent value. All units are
	accounted for as equity-settled awards.


	 


	On June 15, 2016, 75,000 DSUs were granted
	to a new director which vested immediately and are to be paid out at the time of retirement from the Board of Directors. The remaining
	164,582 DSUs were granted to directors throughout the year ended November 30, 2016 based on their election to receive 50% of their
	annual retainer in DSUs.


	 


	On December 23, 2015, 600,000 RSUs were
	granted to officers vesting over a two year period.

	Management of capital risk





	 


	The Company relies upon management to manage
	capital in order to accomplish the objectives of safeguarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order
	to pursue the development of its mineral properties and maintain a capital structure which optimizes the costs of capital at an
	acceptable risk. The Company’s current capital consists of equity funding through capital markets, cash acquired from the
	Sunward Arrangement, and the sale of marketable securities.


	 


	As the Company is currently in the exploration
	phase none of its financial instruments are exposed to commodity price risk; however, the Company’s ability to obtain long-term
	financing and its economic viability may be affected by commodity price volatility.


	 


	To facilitate the management of its capital
	requirements, the Company prepares annual expenditure budgets that are updated as necessary depending on various factors, including
	successful capital deployment and general industry conditions.

	Financial instruments





	 


	The Company is exposed to a variety of
	risks arising from financial instruments. These risks and management’s objectives, policies and procedures for managing these
	risks are disclosed as follows.


	 


	The Company’s financial instruments
	consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits, investments, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
	The fair value of the Company’s financial instruments approximates their carrying value due to the short-term nature of their
	maturity. The Company’s financial instruments initially measured at fair value and then held at amortized cost include cash
	and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The Company’s investments
	are held for trading and are marked-to-market at each period end with changes in fair value recorded to the statement of loss.


	 


	Financial risk management


	 


	The Company’s activities expose them
	to certain financial risks, including currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, interest risk and price risk.


	 






	(e)


	Currency risk




	 


	Currency risk is the risk of a fluctuation
	in financial asset and liability settlement amounts due to a change in foreign exchange rates. The Company operates in the United
	States, Canada, and previously operated in Colombia with some expenses incurred in Canadian dollars and Colombian pesos. The Company’s
	exposure to currency risk at November 30, 2016 is limited to the Canadian dollar (“CDN”) consisting of cash of CDN$451,000,
	accounts receivable of CDN$32,000, deposit amounts of CDN$146,000, investments of CDN$10,521,000 and accounts payable of CDN$528,000.
	Based on a 1% change in the US-Canadian exchange rate, assuming all other variables remain constant, the Company’s net loss
	would change by approximately $79,000.


	 






	(f)


	Credit risk




	 


	Credit risk is the risk of an unexpected
	loss if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company holds cash and
	cash equivalents with Canadian Chartered financial institutions. The Company’s accounts receivable consist of GST receivable
	from the Federal Government of Canada and other receivables for recoverable expenses. The Company’s exposure to credit risk
	is equal to the balance of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable as recorded in the financial statements.


	 






	(g)


	Liquidity risk




	 


	Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company
	will encounter difficulties raising funds to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company is in the exploration
	stage and does not have cash inflows from operations; therefore, the Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its
	capital structure and financial leverage.

	(h)


	Interest rate risk




	 


	Interest rate risk is the risk that the
	fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company
	is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents. Based on balances as at November
	30, 2016, a 1% change in interest rates would result in a change in net loss of $0.1 million, assuming all other variables remain
	constant.


	 


	As we are currently in the exploration
	phase none of our financial instruments are exposed to commodity price risk; however, our ability to obtain long-term financing
	and its economic viability could be affected by commodity price volatility.


	 


	Fair value accounting


	 


	Financial instruments measured at fair
	value are classified into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according to the significance of the inputs used in making
	the measurement. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:


	 



	Level 1

	— Unadjusted
	quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;



	Level 2

	— Quoted
	prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full
	term of the asset or liability; and



	Level 3

	— Prices
	or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
	by little or no market activity)


	 


	The levels in the fair value hierarchy
	into which the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis
	were categorized as follows:

	The Company’s investments consist
	of shares and warrants in a publicly-held mining company. The share investments are recorded as current investments and are valued
	using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified as a Level 1 financial instrument. The warrants are valued
	using a Black-Scholes pricing model and are considered a Level 3 financial instrument because the valuation models have significant
	unobservable inputs.

	The Company has loss carry-forwards of
	approximately $153.1 million that may be available for tax purposes. Certain of these losses occurred prior to the incorporation
	of the Company and are accounted for in the financial statements as if they were incurred by the Company, as described in note
	1. Prior to the NovaGold Arrangement, the Company undertook a tax reorganization in order to preserve the future deductibility
	of these losses for the Company, subject to the limitations below. Deferred tax assets have been recognized to the extent of future
	taxable income and the future taxable amounts related to taxable temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability is recognized
	can be offset. A valuation allowance has been provided against deferred income tax assets where it is not more likely than not
	that the Company will realize those benefits.


	 


	The losses expire as follows in the following
	jurisdictions:

	Future use of U.S. loss carry-forwards
	is subject to certain limitations under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code including limitations subject to Section 382,
	which relates to a 50% change in control over a three-year period, and are further dependent upon the Company attaining profitable
	operations. An ownership change under Section 382 occurred on January 22, 2009 regarding losses incurred by AGC, of which
	the attributes of those losses were transferred to NovaCopper US with the purchase of the mineral property in October 2011. Therefore,
	approximately $39.4 million of the U.S. losses above are subject to limitation under Section 382. Accordingly, the Company’s
	ability to use these losses may be limited.


	 





	98






	 




	 


	An additional change in control may have
	occurred after November 30, 2011 which may further limit the availability of losses prior to the date of change in control.


	 


	On June 19, 2015, we completed the Sunward
	acquisition which resulted in an acquisition of control of Sunward Resources ULC under of the Income Tax Act in Canada. Therefore,
	the Company’s ability to use approximately $15.2 million of losses in Canada may be limited.

	On January 30, 2017, the Company entered

	On December 15, 2016, 525,000 stock options
	were granted to directors vesting immediately and 1,070,000 stock options were granted to employees vesting equally in thirds on
	the grant date, the first anniversary of the grant date, and the second anniversary of the grant date. Also on December 15, 2016,
	600,000 RSUs were granted to officers vesting equally in thirds on the grant date, the first anniversary of the grant date, and
	the second anniversary of the grant. The first tranche of the RSUs vesting on December 15, 2016 were settled through the issuance
	of 104,599 Common Shares and cash payment of $0.06 million used to satisfy payroll withholding taxes.


	 


	On December 23, 2016, 200,000 RSUs vested

	taxes.

	Item 9A.


	CONTROLS AND
	PROCEDURES




	 


	Disclosure Controls
	and Procedures


	 


	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
	to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted by the Company under U.S. and Canadian securities
	legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in those rules, including providing
	reasonable assurance that material information is gathered and reported to senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer
	(“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to permit timely decisions regarding public
	disclosure. Management, including the CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act and the rules of Canadian
	Securities Administration, as at November 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the
	Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.


	 


	Internal Control over
	Financial Reporting


	 


	Management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
	Act and National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim filings. Any system of
	internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
	determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
	Management has used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated
	Framework (2013) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on this
	assessment, management has concluded that as at November 30, 2016, the Company’s internal control over financial
	reporting was effective.


	 


	Attestation Report
	of the Registered Public Accounting Firm


	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation
	report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a smaller
	reporting company, management’s report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting
	firm pursuant to Dodd-Frank, which exempts smaller reporting companies from complying with Section 404(b) of SOX.


	 


	Changes in Internal
	Controls


	 


	There has been no change in our internal control
	over financial reporting during the year ended November 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
	affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	for the registrant and have:


	 


	(a) Designed such disclosure
	controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that

	those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;


	 


	(b) Designed such internal

	(d) Disclosed in this report
	any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal
	quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably
	likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and


	 


	5. The registrant’s other certifying
	officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s
	auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):


	 


	(a) All significant deficiencies
	and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
	adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and


	 


	(b) Any fraud, whether
	or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control
	over financial reporting.

Trilogy Metals Engages Consultants For Arctic Pre-Feasbility Study









PR Newswire




Jun 5, 2017 7:00 AM EDT













 


















































  VANCOUVER, June 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -  Trilogy Metals Inc. ( TSX, NYSE-MKT: TMQ) ("Trilogy Metals" or "the Company") is pleased to announce that it has engaged Ausenco Engineering Canada Inc. (" Ausenco") to prepare the Arctic pre-feasibility study (" PFS") technical report anticipated to be complete in Q1, 2018.  The Company has also engaged Amec Foster Wheeler (" Amec") to complete mine planning and SRK Consulting ( Canada) Inc. (" SRK") to complete tailings and waste design, hydrology and environmental studies. Ausenco is a global diversified engineering, construction and project management company providing consulting, project delivery and asset management solutions to the resources, energy and infrastructure sectors. Ausenco's experience in base metal and cold weather projects ranges from conceptual, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for new project developments to brownfield expansions with EPCM and EPC delivery.  Ausenco is currently engaged on a number of remote projects with similar characteristics and opportunities to the Arctic project.  Ausenco's office in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada will coordinate the Arctic PFS. "We are pleased to have assembled an excellent team to complete our pre-feasibility study on the high-grade polymetallic Arctic deposit.  Ausenco, Amec and SRK are, all three, highly skilled and reputable companies, and the individual team members at each of these companies have decades of mining experience to draw on.  The Arctic project is the first of many exciting opportunities in the Ambler mining district.  While the Arctic PFS gets underway with a budget of US$7.1 million, we will continue to explore our exciting Bornite property with a budget of US$10 million.  With a US$17 million total budget this year for exploration at Bornite and the Arctic PFS, it will be a very busy and productive year ahead for the Company.  Major mining districts take time to develop and we are fortunate to have long-term support through our partnerships with NANA, AIDEA and South32, as well as continued support from our large shareholders", says Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Style Scores:



F Value | F Growth | C Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Governance






Governance




                Trilogy Metals Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively "Trilogy" or the “Company”) are committed to the highest standards of legal and ethical business conduct. This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics summarizes the legal, ethical and regulatory standards that the Company must follow and is a reminder to our directors, officers and employees of the seriousness of that commitment. Compliance with this Code and high standards of business conduct is mandatory for every director, officer and employee.
    
    

                    
Our business is becoming increasingly complex, both in terms of the
geographies in which we function and the laws with which we must comply.
 To help our directors, officers and employees understand what is
expected of them and to carry out their responsibilities, we have
created this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Additionally, we have
appointed the Company's Chief Financial Officer to serve as the Company
Ethics Officer to ensure adherence to this Code.

This Code is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all our
policies and to all our responsibilities under applicable laws and
regulations. It provides general guidelines to help resolve the ethical
and legal issues encountered in conducting our business. This Code must
be complied with. If you have any questions about anything in the Code
or appropriate actions in light of the Code, you may contact the Company
 Ethics Officer or the Chair of the Audit Committee.

We expect each of our directors, officers and employees to read and
become familiar with the ethical standards described in this Code and to
 affirm their agreement to adhere to these standards by signing the
Company Compliance Certificate. Violations of the law, our corporate
policies or this Code may lead to disciplinary action, including
dismissal in addition to any sanctions resulting from breach of the law.
	

I. We Insist on Honest and Ethical Conduct By All of Our Directors, Officers, Employees and Other Representatives
 We place the highest value on the integrity of our directors, our
officers and our employees and demand this level of integrity in all our
 dealings. We insist on not only ethical dealings with others, but on
the ethical handling of actual or potential conflicts of interest
between personal and professional relationships.

a) Honest and Ethical Conduct

 Directors, officers and employees are required to deal honestly and
ethically with our business partners, competitors and other third
parties. In our dealings with these parties, we:
	




prohibit the making or offering of bribes, kickbacks or any
other form of improper payment, directly or indirectly, to any
representative of a government, business partner or other third party in
 order to obtain a contract, some other commercial benefit or government
 action;
	
prohibit our directors, officers and employees from accepting any bribe, kickback or improper payment from anyone;
prohibit gifts or favors of more than nominal value to or from our business partners;
limit marketing and entertainment expenditures to those that are
 reasonable, necessary, prudent, job-related and consistent with our
policies;
	
require clear and precise communication in our contracts, our
advertising, our literature and other public statements and seek to
eliminate misstatement of fact or misleading impressions;
	
protect all proprietary data provided to us by third parties as reflected in our agreements with them; and
prohibit our representatives from otherwise taking improper
advantage of our business partners or other third parties through
inaccurate billing, manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
information or any other improper practice.
	

b) Conflicts of Interest; Corporate Opportunities

Our directors, officers and employees should not be involved in any
activity that creates or gives the appearance of a conflict of interest
between the interests of the Company and their personal interest or the
interests of a third party they are involved with. A conflict of
interest occurs when an individual's private interest (or the interest
of a member of his or her family) interferes, or even appears to
interfere, with the interests of the Company as a whole. Employees must
notify the Company Ethics Officer and officers and directors must notify
 the Chair of the Audit Committee of the existence of any actual or
potential conflict of interest.
	

 No director, officer or employee shall:


be a consultant to, or a director, officer or employee of, or otherwise operate an outside business that:
	
competes with
the Company;
		
supplies products or services to
the Company; or
		
purchases products or services from
the Company;
		

have any financial interest, including significant stock
ownership, which means 10% or more of the common stock, in any entity
with which
the Company does business that might create or give the
appearance of a conflict of interest;
	
seek or accept any personal loan or services from any entity
with which
the Company does business, except from financial institutions
or service providers offering similar loans or services to third parties
 under similar terms in the ordinary course of their respective
businesses;
	
be a consultant to, or a director, officer or employee of, or
otherwise operate an outside business, if the demands of the outside
business would interfere with the director's, officer's or employee's
responsibilities to
the Company (if in doubt, consult the Company Ethics
Officer or the Chair of the Audit Committee);
	
accept any personal loan or guarantee of obligations from
the Company, except to the extent such arrangements are legally
permissible; or
	
conduct business on behalf of
the Company with immediate family,
which includes spouses, children, parents, siblings and persons sharing
the same home, whether or not legal relatives.
	

Should an employee want to conduct work for another mining company, the
employee must advise the Company Ethics Officer and receive the
permission of the Company Ethics Officer prior to starting work with the
 other mining company. Should a director or officer want to conduct work
 for another mining company, the director or officer must advise the
Board of Directors and receive permission from the Board of Directors
prior to starting work with the other mining company. Should a potential
 conflict of interest be triggered in either of these situations, the
director, officer or employee will not engage in such work.

c) Confidentiality and Corporate Assets

Our directors, officers and employees are entrusted with confidential
information and with the confidential information of our business
partners. This information may include (1) technical or scientific
information about current and future projects, (2) business or marketing
 plans or projections, (3) earnings and other internal financial data,
(4) personnel information, (5) supply and customer lists and (6) other
non-public information that, if disclosed, might be of use to our
competitors or harmful to our business partners. This information is our
 property, or the property of our business partners, and in many cases
was developed at great expense. Our directors, officers and employees
shall:
	


not discuss confidential information with or in the presence of any unauthorized persons, including family members and friends;
use confidential information only for legitimate business purposes and not for personal gain;
not disclose confidential information to third parties; and
not use
the Company property or resources for any personal
benefit or the personal benefit of anyone else.
the Company property
includes
the Company internet, email and voicemail services, which should
 be used for business-related activities, and which may be monitored by
the Company at any time without notice.
	

II. We Provide Full, Accurate, Timely and Understandable Disclosure
We are committed to providing our shareholders and investors with full,
fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports that
 we file with the securities regulators and stock exchanges on which our
 securities are listed for trading. To this end, where the individual is
 involved in these activities, our directors, officers and employees
shall:


not make false or misleading entries in our books and records for any reason;
not condone any undisclosed or unrecorded bank accounts or assets established for any purpose;
comply with applicable generally accepted accounting principles at all times;
notify our Chief Financial Officer if there is an unreported transaction;
maintain a system of internal accounting controls that will
provide reasonable assurances to management that all transactions are
properly recorded;
	
maintain books and records that accurately reflect our transactions;
prohibit the establishment of any undisclosed or unrecorded funds or assets;
maintain a system of internal controls that will provide
reasonable assurances to our management that material information about
the Company is made known to management, particularly during the periods
in which our periodic reports are being prepared;
	
present information in a clear and orderly manner and avoid the
use of unnecessary legal and financial language in our periodic reports;
 and
	
not communicate to the public any nonpublic information unless expressly authorized to do so.

III. We Comply With all Laws, Rules and Regulations
We comply with all laws and governmental regulations that are applicable
 to our activities, and expect all our directors, officers and employees
 to obey the law. Specifically, we are committed to:


maintaining a safe and healthy work environment;
promoting a workplace that is free from discrimination or
harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin,
disability or other prohibited grounds under applicable human rights
law;
	
supporting fair competition and laws prohibiting restraints of trade and other unfair trade practices;
conducting our activities in full compliance with all applicable environmental laws;
keeping the political activities of our directors, officers and employees separate from our business;
prohibiting any illegal payments, gifts or gratuities to any government officials or political party;
prohibiting the unauthorized use, reproduction or distribution
of any third party's trade secrets, copyrighted information or
confidential information;
	
prohibiting the sale or export, either directly or through our
representatives, of our products to countries where technology-related
goods such as ours may not be sold; and
	
complying with all applicable securities laws.

Our directors, officers and employees are prohibited from trading our
securities while in possession of material nonpublic ("inside")
information about         the Company and must comply with the requirements of
the Insider Trading Policy in this regard.




Compliance with this Code is, first and foremost, the individual
responsibility of every director, officer and employee. We attempt to
foster a work environment in which ethical issues and concerns may be
raised and discussed with supervisors or with others without the fear of
 retribution. It is our responsibility to provide a system of reporting
and access when you wish to report a suspected violation, or to seek
counseling, and the normal chain of command cannot, for whatever reason,
 be used.

I. Administration
Our Board of Directors and Audit Committee have established the
standards of business conduct contained in this Code and oversee and
monitor compliance with this Code. Additionally, we have appointed the
Company's Chief Financial Officer to serve as the Company Ethics Officer
 to ensure adherence to the Code. While serving in this capacity, the
Company Ethics Officer reports to the Board of Directors.

Training on this Code will be included in the orientation of new
employees and provided to existing directors, officers and employees on
an ongoing basis. To ensure familiarity with this Code, all new
directors, officers and employees will be asked to read this Code and
sign a Compliance Certificate when joining         the Company. Employees in key
Senior Management, Human Resource, Information Technology and Finance
and Accounting roles will be required to sign this Code on an annual
basis.

II. Reporting Violations and Questions
Directors, officers and employees must report, in person or in writing,
any known or suspected violations of laws, governmental regulations or
this Code to either the Company Ethics Officer or the Chair of the Audit
 Committee of our Board of Directors as soon as practicable upon
becoming aware of the known or suspected violation. Additionally,
directors, officers and employees may contact the Company Ethics Officer
 or the Chair of the Audit Committee with a question or concern about
this Code or a business practice. Any questions or violation reports
will be addressed immediately and seriously, and can be made
anonymously. If you feel uncomfortable reporting suspected violations to
 these individuals, you may report matters through         the Company's
whistleblower hotline or to         the Company's Outside Counsel. The address
and telephone numbers of Outside Counsel are listed in the attachment to
 this Code.

We will not allow any retaliation against a director, officer or employee who acts in good faith in reporting any violation.

III. Investigations
Our Company Ethics Officer will investigate any reported violations and
will determine an appropriate response, including corrective action and
preventative measures, in consultation with the Chair of the Audit
Committee or Chief Executive Officer, when required. All reports will be
 treated confidentially to every extent possible.

IV. Consequences of a Violation
Directors, officers and employees that violate any laws, governmental
regulations or this Code will face appropriate, case-specific
disciplinary action, which may include reprimand, suspension without
pay, demotion or immediate discharge. Any waivers from this Code that
are granted for the benefit of our directors or Executive Officers shall
 be granted by the Board or a Board committee only.
