TDCJ - William R. Boyd Unit (BY)




            Freestone County
            
                State Prison
            






 TDCJ - William R. Boyd Unit (BY) is classed as a medium security facility. It has a strengthened perimeter fence and electronic detection systems to ensure inmates stay within the confined areas within the facility. To help inmates prepare themselves to rejoin the wider community, offers a wide range of work and treatment programs. The medium classification means that the inmates are supervised 24/7 with controlled movements. Medium and security prisons house more serious offenders, but inmates can also be sent to serve time in a lower security facilities for things like good behavior at the end of a sentence.
 
 TDCJ - William R. Boyd Unit (BY) is a state prison. This penitentiary is operated by the state of Texas Department of Corrections (DOC) and is used to house and rehabilitate criminals sentenced by a judge to a specific commitment term. The state's prisons are funded by state tax money to provide food and clothes to inmates and to train and hire employees to operate the prison efficiently.
Convicted criminals are sent to prison as punishment and are "property of the state". They must follow very strict rules of conduct and order or they are held to additional punishment like loss of privileges or isolation. They do retain some rights as granted by the state and federal constitutions. Prison is like a town inside a town. There is a mayor (the warden), police (correctional staff), a jail (disciplinary segregation unit, the SHU, the "hole"), laws (administrative rules), judges (hearings officers), a store (the commissary), housing (cells), medical care (infirmary), library (law, education and lending), civic organizations (clubs), worship (chapel), a park (the recreation yard), a cafeteria (chow hall), and the inmates all have a job that assist in keeping the facility running. 
There is no privacy in prison - inmates dress, shower, and use the bathroom in the company of other inmates.  Inmates are required to make their bunks and keep their personal possessions neat.  All inmates wear identical clothing and must carry their identification card with them at all times.  Most possessions allowed must be purchased from the canteen. Meal times are assigned and inmates have 25 minutes in which to eat and leave the dining room, there are no seconds. Inmates are subject to searches of their person and/or cell at any time.  All movements of inmates from one area to another are monitored and supervised. 
Visitation is a privilege reserved for inmates in good standing and contact is limited. All phone calls (except legal calls) are recorded and monitored and must be made collect or with a pre-paid account, or a debit card.
