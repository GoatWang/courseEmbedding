History[edit]
General Cable was incorporated in New Jersey in 1927, merging several older companies founded in the 19th century, including Phillips Wire and Safety Cable Company, Rome Wire Company, and Standard Underground Cable.[5] General Cable was owned by Penn Central from 1981 to 1992.[6]
Products[edit]
General Cable produces copper and aluminum wire, and optical fiber, as well as electrical cable products for the energy, construction, industrial, specialty and communications markets. The company's power cables include low-, medium- and high-voltage power distribution and power transmission products. General Cable's application-specific industrial and specialty cables are used in electrical power generation — traditional and renewable — the oil, gas and petrochemical industries; mining; industrial automation; automotive, marine, and transit; and military, aerospace and OEM applications. Its communications wire and cable products transmit low-voltage signals for voice, data, video and control applications.[7] General Cable sells its products under several brands including Anaconda®, Carol®, GenSPEED®, NextGen®, NSW®, NUAL®, Prestolite Wire®, Silec® and STABILOY®.
Corporate information[edit]
Logo[edit]




General Cable's 1927 logo, representing three lengths of cable overlaid on one another


When General Cable officially formed in 1927, the company introduced its first trademark logo, declaring a unified corporate identity to its customers, investors, suppliers, and associates.[8]
Since the original 1927 version, the company's logo has been modified five times. Today, the trademarked logo consists of the "General Cable" stylized black text with a green "Reuleaux triangle" on the left, which is a modernized version of the 1927 symbol.[8]
Locations[edit]




General Cable's global headquarters, located in Highland Heights, Kentucky


General Cable's global headquarters is located in Highland Heights, Kentucky. This facility, which also serves as the North American headquarters and employs approximately 400 associates, has been operating since 1992.
General Cable operates internationally,[9] with regional business operations in North America, Latin America, and Europe. The company has a global network of manufacturing facilities in core markets, with sales representation and distribution worldwide.
Employees[edit]
In 2016, General Cable employed 11,000 associates working in manufacturing plants, distribution centers, technology centers, sales offices, and at corporate headquarters for the development, design, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of copper, aluminum, and fiber optic wire and cable products.[10]
In June 2013, General Cable placed 17th among the 40 top midsized (150 to 499 employees) companies in the Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky region. Subcategories included company direction, managers, execution, pay and benefits, career, and conditions.[11]
Company culture[edit]
Green initiative[edit]
General Cable implemented green initiatives to push the company to develop environmentally conscious strategies amidst their global presence. General Cable's "Green Alternative Approach" identifies green opportunities such as green cabling solutions whenever possible; the company states that this includes "promoting existing green products; partnering with key customers in their green endeavors; identifying and providing resources for green product gaps; and participating as members in the U.S. Green Building Council and collaborative ventures such as the Green Suppliers Network (GSN)."[12]
Lean Six Sigma[edit]
In 2000, General Cable began its Lean Six Sigma journey to eliminate waste and non-value-added processes in manufacturing and everyday business, improving the flow of information and materials. The initiative strives to drive improvement while maintaining reliable, effective outcomes and delivering savings to the company's bottom line.[13]
"Industry Week's" Best Plants Award Program, an annual recognition of manufacturing facilities that are on the leading edge of efforts to increase competitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction, and create stimulating work environments, has recognized several General Cable North American plants. Since 2001, General Cable has had eight of its 18 North American plants selected as finalists in the Best Plants competition. To date, seven of those manufacturing facilities have gone on to achieve the title of one of the Top 10 Best Plants in North America.[14]
The 12 Principles of Manufacturing Excellence[edit]
In 2011, Larry E Fast, former CEO of General Cable published The 12 Principles of Manufacturing Excellence: A Leader's Guide to Achieving and Sustaining Excellence.
Foreign bribery[edit]
In 2016, the company was ordered to pay over $75 million to resolve both SEC and Department of Justice investigations into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for making illicit payments to government officials in Africa and Asia.[15]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

History[edit]
General Cable was incorporated in New Jersey in 1927, merging several older companies founded in the 19th century, including Phillips Wire and Safety Cable Company, Rome Wire Company, and Standard Underground Cable.[5] General Cable was owned by Penn Central from 1981 to 1992.[6]
Products[edit]
General Cable produces copper and aluminum wire, and optical fiber, as well as electrical cable products for the energy, construction, industrial, specialty and communications markets. The company's power cables include low-, medium- and high-voltage power distribution and power transmission products. General Cable's application-specific industrial and specialty cables are used in electrical power generation — traditional and renewable — the oil, gas and petrochemical industries; mining; industrial automation; automotive, marine, and transit; and military, aerospace and OEM applications. Its communications wire and cable products transmit low-voltage signals for voice, data, video and control applications.[7] General Cable sells its products under several brands including Anaconda®, Carol®, GenSPEED®, NextGen®, NSW®, NUAL®, Prestolite Wire®, Silec® and STABILOY®.
Corporate information[edit]
Logo[edit]




General Cable's 1927 logo, representing three lengths of cable overlaid on one another


When General Cable officially formed in 1927, the company introduced its first trademark logo, declaring a unified corporate identity to its customers, investors, suppliers, and associates.[8]
Since the original 1927 version, the company's logo has been modified five times. Today, the trademarked logo consists of the "General Cable" stylized black text with a green "Reuleaux triangle" on the left, which is a modernized version of the 1927 symbol.[8]
Locations[edit]




General Cable's global headquarters, located in Highland Heights, Kentucky


General Cable's global headquarters is located in Highland Heights, Kentucky. This facility, which also serves as the North American headquarters and employs approximately 400 associates, has been operating since 1992.
General Cable operates internationally,[9] with regional business operations in North America, Latin America, and Europe. The company has a global network of manufacturing facilities in core markets, with sales representation and distribution worldwide.
Employees[edit]
In 2016, General Cable employed 11,000 associates working in manufacturing plants, distribution centers, technology centers, sales offices, and at corporate headquarters for the development, design, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of copper, aluminum, and fiber optic wire and cable products.[10]
In June 2013, General Cable placed 17th among the 40 top midsized (150 to 499 employees) companies in the Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky region. Subcategories included company direction, managers, execution, pay and benefits, career, and conditions.[11]
Company culture[edit]
Green initiative[edit]
General Cable implemented green initiatives to push the company to develop environmentally conscious strategies amidst their global presence. General Cable's "Green Alternative Approach" identifies green opportunities such as green cabling solutions whenever possible; the company states that this includes "promoting existing green products; partnering with key customers in their green endeavors; identifying and providing resources for green product gaps; and participating as members in the U.S. Green Building Council and collaborative ventures such as the Green Suppliers Network (GSN)."[12]
Lean Six Sigma[edit]
In 2000, General Cable began its Lean Six Sigma journey to eliminate waste and non-value-added processes in manufacturing and everyday business, improving the flow of information and materials. The initiative strives to drive improvement while maintaining reliable, effective outcomes and delivering savings to the company's bottom line.[13]
"Industry Week's" Best Plants Award Program, an annual recognition of manufacturing facilities that are on the leading edge of efforts to increase competitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction, and create stimulating work environments, has recognized several General Cable North American plants. Since 2001, General Cable has had eight of its 18 North American plants selected as finalists in the Best Plants competition. To date, seven of those manufacturing facilities have gone on to achieve the title of one of the Top 10 Best Plants in North America.[14]
The 12 Principles of Manufacturing Excellence[edit]
In 2011, Larry E Fast, former CEO of General Cable published The 12 Principles of Manufacturing Excellence: A Leader's Guide to Achieving and Sustaining Excellence.
Foreign bribery[edit]
In 2016, the company was ordered to pay over $75 million to resolve both SEC and Department of Justice investigations into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for making illicit payments to government officials in Africa and Asia.[15]

General Cable's "Green Alternative Approach" identifies green opportunities such as green cabling solutions whenever possible; the company states that this includes "promoting existing green products; partnering with key customers in their green endeavors; identifying and providing resources for green product gaps; and participating as members in the U.S. Green Building Council and collaborative ventures such as the Green Suppliers Network (GSN)."[12]
Lean Six Sigma[edit]
In 2000, General Cable began its Lean Six Sigma journey to eliminate waste and non-value-added processes in manufacturing and everyday business, improving the flow of information and materials. The initiative strives to drive improvement while maintaining reliable, effective outcomes and delivering savings to the company's bottom line.[13]
"Industry Week's" Best Plants Award Program, an annual recognition of manufacturing facilities that are on the leading edge of efforts to increase competitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction, and create stimulating work environments, has recognized several General Cable North American plants. Since 2001, General Cable has had eight of its 18 North American plants selected as finalists in the Best Plants competition. To date, seven of those manufacturing facilities have gone on to achieve the title of one of the Top 10 Best Plants in North America.[14]

In 2011, Larry E Fast, former CEO of General Cable published The 12 Principles of Manufacturing Excellence: A Leader's Guide to Achieving and Sustaining Excellence.
Foreign bribery[edit]
In 2016, the company was ordered to pay over $75 million to resolve both SEC and Department of Justice investigations into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for making illicit payments to government officials in Africa and Asia.[15]

General Cable was incorporated in New Jersey in 1927, merging several older companies founded in the 19th century, including Phillips Wire and Safety Cable Company, Rome Wire Company, and Standard Underground Cable.[5] General Cable was owned by Penn Central from 1981 to 1992.[6]

The company's power cables include low-, medium- and high-voltage power distribution and power transmission products. General Cable's application-specific industrial and specialty cables are used in electrical power generation — traditional and renewable — the oil, gas and petrochemical industries; mining; industrial automation; automotive, marine, and transit; and military, aerospace and OEM applications. Its communications wire and cable products transmit low-voltage signals for voice, data, video and control applications.[7] General Cable sells its products under several brands including Anaconda®, Carol®, GenSPEED®, NextGen®, NSW®, NUAL®, Prestolite Wire®, Silec® and STABILOY®.

General Cable's 1927 logo, representing three lengths of cable overlaid on one another


When General Cable officially formed in 1927, the company introduced its first trademark logo, declaring a unified corporate identity to its customers, investors, suppliers, and associates.[8]
Since the original 1927 version, the company's logo has been modified five times. Today, the trademarked logo consists of the "General Cable" stylized black text with a green "Reuleaux triangle" on the left, which is a modernized version of the 1927 symbol.[8]

Corporate information[edit]
Logo[edit]




General Cable's 1927 logo, representing three lengths of cable overlaid on one another


When General Cable officially formed in 1927, the company introduced its first trademark logo, declaring a unified corporate identity to its customers, investors, suppliers, and associates.[8]
Since the original 1927 version, the company's logo has been modified five times. Today, the trademarked logo consists of the "General Cable" stylized black text with a green "Reuleaux triangle" on the left, which is a modernized version of the 1927 symbol.[8]
Locations[edit]




General Cable's global headquarters, located in Highland Heights, Kentucky


General Cable's global headquarters is located in Highland Heights, Kentucky. This facility, which also serves as the North American headquarters and employs approximately 400 associates, has been operating since 1992.
General Cable operates internationally,[9] with regional business operations in North America, Latin America, and Europe. The company has a global network of manufacturing facilities in core markets, with sales representation and distribution worldwide.
Employees[edit]

Company culture[edit]
Green initiative[edit]

General Cable's "Green Alternative Approach" identifies green opportunities such as green cabling solutions whenever possible; the company states that this includes "promoting existing green products; partnering with key customers in their green endeavors; identifying and providing resources for green product gaps; and participating as members in the U.S. Green Building Council and collaborative ventures such as the Green Suppliers Network (GSN)."[12]
Lean Six Sigma[edit]
In 2000, General Cable began its Lean Six Sigma journey to eliminate waste and non-value-added processes in manufacturing and everyday business, improving the flow of information and materials. The initiative strives to drive improvement while maintaining reliable, effective outcomes and delivering savings to the company's bottom line.[13]
"Industry Week's" Best Plants Award Program, an annual recognition of manufacturing facilities that are on the leading edge of efforts to increase competitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction, and create stimulating work environments, has recognized several General Cable North American plants. Since 2001, General Cable has had eight of its 18 North American plants selected as finalists in the Best Plants competition. To date, seven of those manufacturing facilities have gone on to achieve the title of one of the Top 10 Best Plants in North America.[14]

In 2011, Larry E Fast, former CEO of General Cable published The 12 Principles of Manufacturing Excellence: A Leader's Guide to Achieving and Sustaining Excellence.
Foreign bribery[edit]
In 2016, the company was ordered to pay over $75 million to resolve both SEC and Department of Justice investigations into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for making illicit payments to government officials in Africa and Asia.[15]
