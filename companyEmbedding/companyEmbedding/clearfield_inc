Clearfield quadruples fiber management products manufacturing capacity in Mexico








July 26, 2017








































On July 25, Clearfield, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLFD), a specialist in fiber management products for communication service providers, announced the broadening of manufacturing capacity in its Tijuana, Mexico facility. 
According to a press release, "Through space and head-count additions, Clearfield is positioned to quadruple its manufacturing presence in Mexico. This expansion is a clear indication of the value the market is realizing from Clearfield’s line of fiber management and fiber delivery solutions. The expansion assists in lowering Clearfield’s cost of product manufacturing while ensuring Clearfield continues to lead the industry through short lead time and on-time deliveries."[Native Advertisement]
The company's statement continues, "Clearfield’s decade of experience, which has produced unrivaled, scalable building blocks for the FTTx market, is a major driver behind the company's expansion. To that end, the Mexico facility is modeled after the company’s U.S. manufacturing facilities in Minneapolis. Like the U.S. based facility, Clearfield’s Mexican operations are fully equipped with passive optical LAN technology providing fiber-to-the-desktop and fiber-to-the-workstation functionality."
"Our Mexican manufacturing facilities fully complement our ongoing operations at our U.S. headquarters,” said Cheri Beranek, Clearfield's president and CEO. "As part of our global initiative to provide our customers the best total cost of ownership solutions, this strategic investment in manufacturing capacity will position us to build upon our growing momentum throughout the North American national carrier marketplace.”





Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, Clearfield designs, manufactures and distributes fiber-optic management, protection and delivery products for communications networks, and says it deploys more than a million fiber ports each year. For more information, visit www.SeeClearfield.com.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Clearfield quadruples fiber management products manufacturing capacity in Mexico








July 26, 2017








































On July 25, Clearfield, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLFD), a specialist in fiber management products for communication service providers, announced the broadening of manufacturing capacity in its Tijuana, Mexico facility. 
According to a press release, "Through space and head-count additions, Clearfield is positioned to quadruple its manufacturing presence in Mexico. This expansion is a clear indication of the value the market is realizing from Clearfield’s line of fiber management and fiber delivery solutions. The expansion assists in lowering Clearfield’s cost of product manufacturing while ensuring Clearfield continues to lead the industry through short lead time and on-time deliveries."[Native Advertisement]
The company's statement continues, "Clearfield’s decade of experience, which has produced unrivaled, scalable building blocks for the FTTx market, is a major driver behind the company's expansion. To that end, the Mexico facility is modeled after the company’s U.S. manufacturing facilities in Minneapolis. Like the U.S. based facility, Clearfield’s Mexican operations are fully equipped with passive optical LAN technology providing fiber-to-the-desktop and fiber-to-the-workstation functionality."
"Our Mexican manufacturing facilities fully complement our ongoing operations at our U.S. headquarters,” said Cheri Beranek, Clearfield's president and CEO. "As part of our global initiative to provide our customers the best total cost of ownership solutions, this strategic investment in manufacturing capacity will position us to build upon our growing momentum throughout the North American national carrier marketplace.”





Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, Clearfield designs, manufactures and distributes fiber-optic management, protection and delivery products for communications networks, and says it deploys more than a million fiber ports each year. For more information, visit www.SeeClearfield.com.

 /EIN News/ -- “The results for the fiscal third quarter are lower than our expectations, driven primarily by volatility within several significant customers,” stated Cheri Beranek, President and CEO of Clearfield. “While third quarter revenue is disappointing, we are pleased with the overall progress we’re seeing in the business as a whole, especially at the national carrier level. “Year-to-date revenues from Clearfield’s traditional service provider markets has grown 9% compared to the same year-ago period. Much of this underlying business is performing according to plan. However, the market we serve continues to experience a lot of noise. This noise manifested itself primarily in the alternative carrier, wireless and cable TV markets.  Though it remains difficult to predict when the demand from these markets will rebound and stabilize, we believe that growth drivers, including next generation cell services driven by 5G and the Internet of Things, will pave the way for these service providers to reignite and scale their optical fiber deployments in the future. “This noise further masks our success in the expansive Tier 1 market. Our Tier 1 revenue in the first three quarters of this year is nearly double the full year revenue last year. Further, our international revenues year-to-date are 75% above last year’s revenues in the same period. “Based on the results we’ve achieved year-to-date and our outlook for fiscal Q4, we are revising our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2017 to be consistent with last year’s total revenue of $75 million. Although our revenue projections are less than originally anticipated, we are reiterating our full year guidance for gross profit percent and income from operations. We are also reiterating our guidance for operating expenses, but specifically excluding the impact of the patent infringement lawsuit which was initiated after our operating expense guidance was originally developed.  Clearfield remains dedicated to aggressive but disciplined investments to propel our growth. Through the third quarter ended June 30, 2017, our net income was 4.7% of sales. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, investors can expect similar results. “We recognize that this reduction in income is disappointing to investors. As we continue to make investments to increase our market share, particularly in the national carrier market, it’s important to keep in mind that while Clearfield has established significant market share in the Tier 3 markets during the first stage of our growth, the market opportunity in front of us as we enter the next stage of our development dwarfs the success we have delivered to date.” Fiscal Q3 2017 Financial ResultsRevenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 9% to $19.6 million from $21.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven primarily by lower sales to the Company’s alternative carrier, wireless, and cable TV customers, and was partially offset by an increase in sales to the Company’s domestic and international wireline customers, which was supported by strong growth in sales to the Tier 1 market. Excluding revenue from the Company’s alternative carrier business, revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 would have been consistent with the same year-ago quarter. Gross profit decreased 15% to $7.9 million, or 40.5% of revenue, from $9.3 million, or 43.2% of revenue, in the third fiscal quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross profit was due to decreased volume.  The decrease in gross profit percent was primarily due to a lower percentage of sales associated with optical component solutions, which typically have higher gross margins. Operating expenses were $6.6 million, an increase of 13% compared to $5.9 million in the same year-ago quarter. Among the operating expense increases were expenses related to additional sales and marketing professionals, enhancements to the Company’s current product line-up and an acceleration of the Company’s investments in product certification testing to successfully compete in the Tier 1 market. Income from operations decreased 62% to $1.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 from $3.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. Income tax expense decreased 48% to $593,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 from $1.1 million in the same year-ago quarter. The Company recognized a net tax benefit of $80,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 as a result of the adoption in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 of a new accounting pronouncement related to the income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. This net tax benefit and related effects are reflected in the table above and the accompanying financial statements. Net income decreased 66% to $803,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, or $0.06 per diluted share, from $2.4 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. At quarter-end, cash, cash equivalents and investments remained consistent at $42.6 million when compared to the end of the prior quarter. The Company had no debt at quarter end. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 164,842 shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program. In April 2017, the Company’s board of directors increased the previously approved stock repurchase program by an additional $4 million to $12 million. Order backlog (defined as purchase orders received but not yet fulfilled) at June 30, 2017 decreased 26% to $4.4 million from $6.0 million at March 31, 2017, and decreased 35% from $6.7 million at June 30, 2016. Fiscal Nine Month 2017 Financial ResultsRevenue increased 2% to a record $55.5 million for the nine-month period ending June 30, 2017 from $54.2 million during the same period in fiscal 2016. Revenue from customers outside of the alternative carrier business increased 9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016. Gross profit was $22.6 million, or 40.7% of revenue, for the nine-month period ending June 30, 2017, a decrease of 3% from $23.3 million, 43.0% of revenue, during the same period in fiscal 2016. Operating expenses increased 20% to $18.8 million for the nine-month period ending June 30, 2017 from $15.7 million during the same period in fiscal 2016. Income from operations totaled $3.8 million, or 6.8% of revenue, for the nine-month period ending June 30, 2017 compared to $7.6 million, or 14.0% of revenue, during the same period in fiscal 2016. Net income totaled $2.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the nine-month period ending June 30, 2017, a decrease of 52% from $5.3 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, during the same period in fiscal 2016.

Words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “outlook,” or “continue” or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward looking statements include, for example, statements about the Company’s future revenue and operating performance, growth of the FTTx markets, effectiveness of the Company’s sales and marketing strategies and organization, utilization of manufacturing capacity, and the development and marketing of products.

Certain important factors could have a material impact on the Company's performance, including, without limitation: our success depends upon adequate protection of our patent and intellectual property rights and our ability to successfully defend against claims of infringement; our results of operations could be adversely affected now that the stimulus funds of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act are fully allocated and projections are nearing completion; National Broadband Plan’s transitioning from the USF to the CAF program may cause our customers and prospective customers to delay or reduce purchases; a significant percentage of our sales in the last three fiscal years have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of these major customers would adversely affect us; intense competition in our industry may result in price reductions, lower gross profits and loss of market share; our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses; our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which may make budgeting for expenses difficult and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock; to compete effectively, we must continually improve existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance; we may face circumstances in the future that will result in impairment charges, including, but not limited to, significant goodwill impairment charges; we rely on single-source suppliers, which could cause delays, increases in costs or prevent us from completing customer orders, all of which could materially harm our business; we face risks associated with expanding our sales outside of the United States; further consolidation among our customers may result in the loss of some customers and may reduce sales during the pendency of business combinations and related integration activities; we are dependent on key personnel; product defects or the failure of our products to meet specifications could cause us to lose customers and sales or to incur unexpected expenses; and other factors set forth in Part I, Item IA.

About Clearfield
As an early innovator in FTTH and a pioneer in delivering modular, scalable, building-block solutions, Clearfield established itself as a thought leader in this rapidly developing industry. And while fiber is not new, Clearfield’s fresh approach is innovating fiber networks. In short, we think differently!
As a trusted business partner across all fiber access domains with operators large and small, Clearfield’s industry-leading product delivery and fiber management, protection, and delivery products enable service providers to cost-effectively build and scale their fiber networks on-time and on-budget. 
Beyond plug-and-play, Clearfield’s patented technologies and nimble product delivery allows providers to react to the inevitable variables of a network deployment, saving planning, inventory, labor and deployment time for a TCO offering unmatched by any one else in the industry.

In-Cassette Splicing – Improving the Bottom LineRelocating the splice in any FTTx deployment will:

Reduce material costs
Lower time and labor costs
Accelerate subscriber revenues through improved service turn-up time

We're not changing the way you do business — just helping you make your business more profitable.
Let us prove it to you.
Clearview Blue


					Why Choose Clearfield
Speed of DeploymentClearfield’s world-class lead times for products, enable our customers to shorten their planning and engineering horizons.  Choosing Clearfield means not only do you have access to innovative product designs, but as your trusted supplier we'll also deliver those products on-time to the agreed delivery date.

Lower Labor Costs
					Traditional splicing methods used in building a fiber access network are labor intensive, with labor accounting for roughly 70% of deployment costs. When factory tested, field-proven products replace splicing with “connectorization”, the need for skilled labor and overall cost of deployment goes down.

Innovative DesignsDelivering the most scalable fiber management platform in the industry, Clearfield ensures your investment in capital equipment grows alongside your take rates. With Clearfield, the required inventories are reduced, the time to activation is reduced, and service reliability is improved because there are fewer opportunities for error.
