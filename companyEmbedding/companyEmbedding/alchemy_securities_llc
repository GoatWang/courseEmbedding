You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

PCI Compliance 








Most organizations underestimate the difficulty of sustained compliance to the rigorous requirements of the PCI Data Security Standard. Alchemy Security brings years of expertise, experience, and a considerable knowledge base to our clients. Organizations ill-prepared to meet compliance dates often face unplanned business disruptions, potential fines, and costly remediation efforts. Alchemy Security helps organizations minimize these consequences by providing full life cycle security services required for PCI Compliance. Services we provide on behalf of our clients include:


“Pre-audit” Compliance Gap Assessment Services
Performing a gap analysis is a great way to understand what types of audit findings may exist prior to the Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) performing the official assessment. It also serves as a pre-cursor to developing required strategic planning and remediation efforts.
PCI Strategic Planning & Remediation Services
This service assists our clients with developing a comprehensive actionable plan for remediating all identified gaps in a cost-effective manner.
PCI Infrastructure Architecture/Design
Defining compliance scope within the payment processing environment is critical to reducing costs. We provide network architecture, design, and implementation services to help our clients with this often difficult hurdle.
Firewall/Router Auditing
An often under-appreciated portion of PCI Compliance comes in the form of auditing in-scope firewalls and routers. Alchemy Security is well versed in auditing routing and firewall technologies.
On Demand Consulting Services
Need feedback on a proposed solution or some suggestions of where to look to solve the latest PCI challenges? Take advantage of our retainer package and pick the brains of some of the brightest minds within industry.
Scanning Services
PCI requires both internal and external vulnerability scans occur on a quarterly basis for all in-scope systems. Alchemy Security can assist with meeting this requirement by providing strategic guidance on tools and technology or by performing vulnerability scanning on your behalf.
Penetration Testing Services
PCI requires both internal and external penetration tests occur at least annually for all in-scope systems or when significant network changes occur. Alchemy Security can assist with meeting this requirement by performing network and application layer penetration tests.
Secure Code Reviews
PCI requires that custom code changes are reviewed by a qualified individual for all in-scope applications. Alchemy Security can support organizations who either don’t have the in-house expertise or available resources to review code changes.


Vulnerability Management Frameworks
Another key tenet of PCI requires organizations to implement a robust vulnerability management framework. We provide frameworks appropriate to the type and size of your organization , as well as the associated processes and procedures required to implement an effective vulnerability management program.
Training
Alchemy Security provides training services for all training requirements noted within the PCI-DSS standard.
Policy Development
A security policy provides the overall framework of your information security program. We can help your organization get a jump start on developing a robust information security program leveraging time-tested policy frameworks. Once a framework has been identified, we will assist in custom-tailoring the framework to your specific environment.
Configuration Standards
PCI requires that all in-scope systems and applications have secure configuration (hardening) standards associated with them. Alchemy Security can help organizations craft standards that will meet this requirement as well as implement strategies to ensure that systems are maintained within the configuration standards. Areas of support include all major operating systems, databases, and associated network infrastructure devices.
Vendor Assessment/Product Evaluation Services
Vendor assessment and product evaluation services are designed to help our clients make the most out of their budgets while meeting both objectives of PCI as well as those for your business.
Self Assessment Questionnaire Support
Alchemy Security can provide support in helping organizations better understand the meaning behind the PCI DSS requirements and provide guidance on whether an existing control is sufficient for compliance while completing Self Assessment Questionnaires.

Splunk Solutions 








Alchemy Security, a recognized leader in the field of SIEM Consulting and Operations by Gartner Inc., provides Splunk consulting, ongoing management and security monitoring services to address complex security monitoring, compliance and reporting requirements.


World Class Security Operations
Supercharge your new or existing Splunk environment and achieve world class Intrusion Analysis at a fraction of the cost of building and maintaining your own Security Operations Center. From robust security monitoring, to meeting log management compliance requirements dictated by standards such as HIPAA and PCI, Alchemy Security provides a variety of service options to best meet the needs of your organization.
Traditional SOC Meets Hunt Team Analysis
It has been well documented that the longer a data breach goes undetected, the more significant the post-breach costs become. Historically speaking, Security Operations has taken a reactive approach to Intrusion Analysis. While the traditional SOC model of responding to high risk security events remains relevant, Alchemy Security leads the industry by providing proactive Hunt Team Analysis from our Cyber Security Defense Center, located in Denver, CO. Leveraging Splunk and elements of the Kill Chain framework, our proprietary approach to Intrusion Analysis employs advanced use-case design, advanced machine learning, end point monitoring and proactive “hunting” techniques to more quickly identify security breaches, resulting in faster response and remediation times.
Services delivery options include new or existing deployments that reside on customer premises, cloud hosting, or colocation facilities.


Consulting
Alchemy Security is proud to a be trusted Professional Services delivery partner for Splunk. When it comes to deploying new implementations, system tuning, infrastructure expansion, staff augmentation, use case design and content creation, Alchemy Security has your back.
Every consultant we employ has achieved the coveted SCC II certification, in addition to other certifications such as Splunk Architect, Splunk Admin, Splunk Power User, and certified Sales Engineers. Alchemy Security engineers can satisfy a variety of Security, IT Ops, and other use cases well suited for the Splunk platform.
Contact us to learn more about how Alchemy Security can launch your Splunk implementation to hyperdrive.

PCI Compliance Becomes Scorecard for CSOs

Posted on July 20, 2009November 1, 2016 by Alchemy Security 


Companies recertifying for the second or third year of PCI compliance are having a rough go of things as of late. A combination of the latest clarifications within the revised PCI DSS standard, along with the recent scoring matrix that compels assessors to ensure they have done a thorough job as part of the review, have caught an unfortunate number of CISOs flat footed. Anyone who thinks they are about to go through a “check box exercise” could find themselves with small to large remediation efforts that are forcing many to miss their renewal dates.  These challenges are being exacerbated by the fact that assessors are getting better at their job, and security budgets are getting hit like everything else. These dynamics are generating some painful realities for those chartered to maintain compliance to this very thorough and rigorous standard. Unfortunately for most CISOs, the subtleties of why they are missing compliance dates and risk potential fines and/or change of compliance status for service providers, is lost on executive leadership. Based upon some things we’ve observed over the years, leadership changes aren’t necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn’t serve anyone’s interest to throw the baby out with the bathwater. 
What is a CEO to do?
Meanwhile, CEOs are struggling to drive the business forward in a historically difficult operating environment, and often view the Infosec team as being an impediment rather than an enabler to the business. An ill tempered CEO who thinks his CISO isn’t getting the job done does not bode well for our industry as playing a game of musical chairs merely slows down security initiatives, thus defeating what were certainly good intentions. What makes this decision more difficult is that the CEO has little tangible insight as to whether organizational risk is trending up or down. Graph charts depicting a downtrend of critical findings from Nessus scans surely don’t tell a CEO much about how much risk has been mitigated. Fact is, based upon our observations there are very few CISOs who even know what they are protecting outside of PCI related assets.
Getting beyond the PCI scorecard
Within the current operating landscape, it’s incumbent upon CISOs (or equivalent in responsibility), to position within the organization that compliance is a shared problem between all parts of the business including IT operations, Security Operations, Human Resources, Legal, and Executive Leadership. It should further be made clear what exactly each part of the business is responsible for implementing, and hold all accountable. Finally, bringing effective communications supported by meaningful metrics to the subject are critical to help communicate throughout the leadership chain that residual risk is being appropriately managed and mitigated. 
As for your next PCI assessment, unless you’ve consulted with your QSA to discuss changes made within the standard, it is wise to set expectations with varying levels of leadership that there will likely be findings that weren’t issues within previous years and to anticipate resource requirements accordingly.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
