And in terms of sectors, Energy and Health Care have been key drivers of this comparative outperformance.Equal weight indexes, which have existed for more than a decade, are considered one of the earliest examples of "smart beta" indexes. Russell Indexes applies a unique approach to its equal weight methodology, equal weighting sectors first, and then equal weighting the companies within each sector. The Russell 1000® Equal Weight Index reflects the largest securities in the U.S. equity market on an equal weighted basis while maintaining greater diversification across sectors.Rolf Agather, CFA - Managing Director of Global Research & Innovation, Russell Indexes "The Russell Indexes suite of smart beta indexes is designed to provide investors with new ways of segmenting and reflecting the global equity market beyond traditional market capitalization weighted indexes. Equal weight indexes are designed to include every sector within an investment universe while potentially lessening the impact of any one sector or company on overall index performance. And Russell's equal weight approach of equal weighting sectors, and then companies within sectors, is unique." John G. Feyerer, CFA - VP, Director, Equity ETF Product Strategy, Invesco PowerShares Capital Management, LLC "An equal-weight index is a simple yet effective smart beta strategy that alleviates the stock-specific bias which can occur with market capitalization weighted indexes while incorporating a disciplined rebalancing mechanism. Russell's unique approach to equal weighting sectors followed by equal weighting constituents ensures broad sector diversification while mitigating the impact of a significant sector-specific drawdown on overall index performance."For more information on the Russell 1000® Equal Weight Index a recently published Index Insights entitled The Russell 1000® Equal Weight Sector Indexes: A simple and effective smart beta approach, go to the Russell Indexes website.                  2015 YTD Returns a/o April 30   Russell 1000® Index   Russell 1000® Equal Weight Index   Relative Return (Equal Weight vs Market Cap)   Overall Index   2.3%   3.9%   +1.6%   Health Care Sector   5.8%   9.3%   +3.5%   Energy Sector   4.4%   12.6%   +8.2%   Consumer Discretionary Sector   3.8%   2.9%   (-0.9%)   Technology Sector   3.2%   2.4%   (-0.8%)   Materials & Processing Sector   3.1%   3.4%   +0.3%   Consumer Staples Sector   0.9%   3.7%   +2.8%   Producer Durables Sector   0.1%   1.7%   +1.6%   Utilities Sector   (-0.4%)   (-3.2%)   (-2.8%)   Financial Services Sector   (-0.5%)   1.8%   +2.4%                  Source: Russell Investments. Total returns, US dollar denominated.Please note: Indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly. Returns represent past performance, are not a guarantee of future performance, and are not indicative of any specific investment.Russell's publication of the Indexes or Index constituents in no way suggests or implies a representation or opinion by Russell as to the attractiveness of investing in a particular security. Inclusion of a security in an Index is not a promotion, sponsorship or endorsement of a security by Russell and Russell makes no representation, warranty or guarantee with respect to the performance of any security included in a Russell Index.The Russell 1000 Equal Weight Index equal weights securities in the Russell 1000 Index on a quarterly basis. The index captures the risk and return performance of an equal weight investment strategy for U.S. large-cap stocks. The Russell 1000 Index measures the performance of the large-cap segment of the U.S. equity universe. It is a subset of the Russell 3000® Index and includes approximately 1,000 of the largest securities based on a combination of their market cap and current index membership. The Russell 1000 represents approximately 92% of the U.S. market. The Russell 1000 Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the large-cap segment and is completely reconstituted annually to ensure new and growing equities are reflected.Russell Investments is the owner of the trademarks, service marks and copyrights related to its respective indexes.Opinions expressed by Mr. Agather & Mr. Feyerer reflect market performance as of April 30, 2015 and are subject to change at any time based on market or other conditions without notice. Past performance does not guarantee future performance.
