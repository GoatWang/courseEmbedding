Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for John Hancock Income Securities Trust (NYSE:JHS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Standardized Financials


Intrinio provides professional-grade historical financial data. This data is standardized, cleansed and verified to ensure the highest quality data sourced directly from the XBRL financial statements. The primary purpose of standardized financials are to facilitate comparability across a single company’s fundamentals and across all companies fundamentals.
For example, it is possible to compare total revenues between two companies as of a certain point in time, or within a single company across multiple time periods. This is not possible using the as reported financial statements because of the inherent complexity of reporting standards.

       The Fund’s holdings are subject to change at any time. Characteristics are expressed as a percentage of net assets except for certain closed-end funds where characteristics are expressed as a percentage of total managed assets.
All Funds (with the exception of the Money Market Fund) exclude cash and cash equivalent securities from Top holdings and Top issuers.





Goal and Strategy
The Fund’s primary objective is to generate a high level of current income consistent with prudent risk. The Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in income securities, which include a diversified portfolio of corporate and government bonds. In choosing bonds for the portfolio, the Fund’s managers evaluate the full spectrum of bonds in the marketplace and diversifies across a number of industries. It is contemplated that the Fund may invest up to 25% of the value of its total assets in debt securities that have a rating of below-investment grade by Moody's and Standard & Poor's at the time of purchase.

The performance data shown represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so that investors' shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See performance data current to the most recent month-end, which may be higher or lower than that cited.

Performance figures assume that all distributions are reinvested.

The Fund's market price is the last sale price as of the close of the regular market trading session. The Fund's market price as of and after July 1, 2013 reflects the last sale price in the broad market; market price prior to July 1, 2013 reflects the last sale price on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their NAV. The Fund’s cash available for distribution will vary over time, and there is no guarantee prior distribution levels will be maintained. If, for any calendar year, the total distributions made exceed the amount of the fund's earnings and profits as computed for federal tax purposes, the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital to holders of common shares (up to the amount of each shareholder’s basis in those shares) and thereafter as gain from the sale of common shares. Such return of capital reduces the shareholder’s adjusted basis for common shares, thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss of a subsequent sale. Distributions in any year may include a substantial return-of-capital component. An investment in the fund's Common Shares is subject to investment and market risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund, which are generally are traded on a securities exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. These securities will fluctuate in value, and an investor in the fund may lose some or all of his or her investment, even after accounting for any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Fixed-income investments are subject to interest-rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. An issuer of securities held by the fund may default, have its credit rating downgraded, or otherwise perform poorly. The fund utilizes a Credit Facility Agreement (CFA) to increase its assets available for investment. Shareholders bear the fees associated with this “leverage” and may be disadvantaged from the use of leverage. It is important to recognize that use of leverage increases the Advisor’s fee. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares, including:

the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares
the risk that the cost of utilizing the CFA will increase with rising interest rates
the risk of increased operating costs that can lower fund returns
the risk of a decline in the value of an investment acquired through leverage, while the fund’s obligations under such leverage remain fixed
the risk that the fund will have to sell securities in a volatile market in order to meet asset coverage or other debt compliance requirements

Fund returns will be lower if the cost of the leverage exceeds the income or capital appreciation derived from securities purchased with leverage. If the fund is unable to obtain replacement financing in the event the CFA is terminated, the fund would be required to sell securities at a potentially inopportune time, incurring tax consequences, and its ability to generate income would be adversely affected.
The Fund’s quarterly distributions may be from net investment income, capital gains or return of capital. The distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts. Distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time.
Closed-end fund shares are not redeemable, but instead are traded in the secondary market on an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. They frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. Specialized funds may carry additional risks.
