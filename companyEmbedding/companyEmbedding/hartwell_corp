Hartwell Corporation
is the Preferred Choice
for Latches and Latching Systems
used in Commercial and Defense Aircraft Applications








Who We Are
Hartwell is a leader in the aerospace industry for latches and latching systems for commercial and military aircraft applications. 
Over 75 years in operation and we continue to be on the leading edge of product design and development, delivering high quality, robust and reliable latching products. 
 












History
Founded as a small distribution company in 1939, Hartwell Corporation has grown into a global leader specializing in the design, development, and manufacture of latches and latching systems for the aerospace industry. 
Virtually every aircraft flying today has a variety of Hartwell Latches aboard.  
 










Our strength...
and success is partly due to our philosophy of working side by side with aircraft and engine manufacturers to solve complex problems wherever access into the aircraft is required.  We have specialized in quick access latches since our WWII wartime invention of the Trigger-Lock® latch, which became the industry standard by dramatically reducing the time required to service an aircraft. 
Today we are tooled for over 20,000 versions of latches for various applications including engine cowlings, nacelles and thrust reversers, as well as interior and exterior access panels, cargo doors and interior stowage bins.

Cookies
			Like many websites, our Service uses “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while using our Services.
			We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins.

Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser.
			We may participate in behavioral-based advertising.  This means that a third party may place a cookie on your browser, or use a web beacon, to collect information about your use of our website so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interest.  That advertising may appear either on our website, or on other websites. 
Changing or Deleting Your Information
			All registered Hartwell Corporation users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record. See below for privacy contact information.
Security
			Hartwell Corporation is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access.  No security, however, can eliminate the possibility that your information may be accessed by an unauthorized third party and we cannot guarantee that your information will remain secure in all situations.
			We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email, mail, telephone, or conspicuous posting on our website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.  We reserve the right to choose which method we use to contact you about such an event.
International Transfer
			Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Hartwell Corporation transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
Phishing
			Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Hartwell Corporation. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.
Links to Other Sites
			Our Services may provide links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicHartwell Corporation on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
