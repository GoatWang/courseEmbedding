http://www.insidearm.com/news/00005976-fair-isaac-and-braun-consulting-announce-/






MINNEAPOLIS, MN & CHICAGO, IL – Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE: FIC), the leading provider of analytics and decision technology, and Braun Consulting, Inc. (Nasdaq: BRNC), a marketing strategy and technology consulting firm, today announced agreement on a plan for Fair Isaac to acquire Braun. The acquisition terms have been approved by both companies’ Boards of Directors, and the transaction is expected to close in the fourth calendar quarter. 
 
The acquisition will build upon Fair Isaac’s marketing analytics offerings through the addition of Braun’s proven customer management, product strategy and organizational consulting expertise. The move also will expand Fair Isaac’s client base and presence in priority growth markets, including healthcare, retail and pharmaceuticals. Braun’s experienced senior management team, including founder and CEO Steven Braun, will remain with Fair Isaac and play integral roles in delivering the companies’ combined marketing solutions and services to the marketplace. 
 
“Adding Braun’s roster of seasoned experts will advance and augment our Precision Marketing offerings at a time when more businesses are realizing that the key to increasing customer value and forging loyalty is a more strategic, data-driven marketing approach,” said Tom Grudnowski, CEO of Fair Isaac. “We will be uniquely positioned to help organizations achieve new levels of insight into their customers and convert that insight into smarter, more powerful marketing initiatives that deliver a true competitive advantage.” 
 
Fair Isaac plans to leverage Braun’s consulting practice to help executives who have a stake in the success of marketing efforts — including business unit leaders, operating managers and senior marketing executives — set the strategic context and direction for results-oriented Precision Marketing initiatives. Fair Isaac also expects that Braun’s technology integration experience will help ensure customers realize the greatest benefit from its Precision Marketing solutions. Effective integration through a customized infrastructure can enable a business to execute analytics-influenced decision strategies at every point of customer interaction. 
 
“Our Board of Directors is pleased with the terms of this transaction, which it believes brings great value to Braun’s stockholders,” said Braun. “Fair Isaac and Braun share a common view that a customer-focused, analytics-driven marketing strategy is the first step toward real marketing success. The next step is ensuring that clients can implement that strategy effectively and consistently across the organization, and we believe that our technology integration expertise combined with Fair Isaac’s unmatched analytics will enable marketers to make the most relevant and profitable decision each time they interact with a customer.” 
 
Structure and Terms  Under the acquisition agreement, approved by both Boards of Directors, the stockholders of Braun Consulting will receive $2.34 in cash for each share of Braun. Steven Braun also has agreed to vote shares representing approximately 48 percent of Braun’s outstanding stock in favor of the acquisition. The transaction is structured as a merger, whereby Braun will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fair Isaac. The net cash value of the transaction is approximately $30 million after assumption of the Braun balance sheet, based on Braun’s approximate 17,227,000 shares of currently outstanding stock. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth calendar quarter, subject to approval by Braun’s stockholders.
 
Robert W. Baird & Co. served as financial advisor to Braun Consulting on this transaction. 
 
Fair Isaac will host a conference call today at 12:00 noon Central Time / 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss this acquisition in more detail and update Fair Isaac’s previously provided fiscal year 2005 guidance. Interested parties may dial-in to the call at 1-800-603-9523 in the U.S., or 706-679-7702 from outside the U.S. The conference ID number is 1003248.

Forward-looking statements should be considered with caution. If any of these risks or uncertainties materializes or any of these assumptions proves incorrect, Fair Isaac’s and Braun’s results could differ materially from Fair Isaac’s and Braun’s expectations in these statements.
