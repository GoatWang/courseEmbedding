Mr. Stecko, with his more than ten years of experience as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Packaging Corporation of America, brings to the Board proven leadership and extensive managerial experience at the most senior level. In addition, his years of service in senior management of Tenneco prior to the 1999 transactions that separated our automotive and packaging businesses give Mr. Stecko unique historical perspective that is of particular value to our company. As a result of these experiences, Mr. Stecko has a thorough knowledge and understanding of the complex strategic, operational and financial issues faced by large public companies. Mr. Stecko's appreciation of the role of directors through his experience as both an inside and independent director of other companies positions him well to serve as our lead independent director.
