History[edit]
Johann Rupert founded Compagnie Financière Richemont SA in 1988 when he spun off the international assets of Rembrandt Group Ltd. (now Remgro Limited), a South Africa-based company founded in the 1940s by his father, Dr. Anton Rupert.[4][5] The luxury goods investments of Rembrandt Group combined with Rothmans International formed the initial group of Richemont subsidiaries.[6][7]
According to a state ordered investigation conducted by Ciex and published in 1999, Rembrandt played a part in the 'Bankorp deal' in which several leading South African financial bodies conspired to steal R26 billion from the state during apartheid. The report claims Rembrandt should pay back roughly R2.2 billion for its involvement.[8]
In March 2007, Richemont and Polo Ralph Lauren Inc. announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, the Polo Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company SÀRL.[9]
In October 2008, the Group divested all of its remaining interests in the tobacco industry.[10]
As of November 2012[update], Compagnie Financière Richemont SA is the sixth largest corporation by market capitalization in the Swiss Market Index.[11] As of 2014, Richemont is the second-largest luxury goods company in the world after LVMH.[3]
Organization[edit]
Compagnie Financière Richemont SA organizes its business activities into three operating divisions: Jewellery Maisons, Specialist Watchmakers and Other Businesses.[1]
Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, and Giampiero Bodino constitute the Jewellery Maisons.
The Specialist Watchmakers group is composed of A. Lange & Söhne, Baume & Mercier, IWC Schaffhausen, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Officine Panerai, Piaget, Roger Dubuis, Vacheron Constantin and the joint venture with the Ralph Lauren Watch & Jewelry Co.
The Other Businesses division includes Azzedine Alaïa, Chloé, Dunhill, Lancel, Montblanc, Peter Millar, Purdey and Shanghai Tang.[1]
Ownership and control[edit]
The largest significant shareholder of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA is Compagnie Financière Rupert, a Swiss company that holds shares controlled and principally owned by Johann Rupert. Compagnie Financière Rupert owns 522,000,000 Class "B" shares of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, representing 9.1% of the equity and 50% of the voting rights. Johann Rupert and Compagnie Financière Rupert also hold 2,836,664 class "A" shares or "A" share equivalents as of the end of March 2016.[12]

History[edit]
Johann Rupert founded Compagnie Financière Richemont SA in 1988 when he spun off the international assets of Rembrandt Group Ltd. (now Remgro Limited), a South Africa-based company founded in the 1940s by his father, Dr. Anton Rupert.[4][5] The luxury goods investments of Rembrandt Group combined with Rothmans International formed the initial group of Richemont subsidiaries.[6][7]
According to a state ordered investigation conducted by Ciex and published in 1999, Rembrandt played a part in the 'Bankorp deal' in which several leading South African financial bodies conspired to steal R26 billion from the state during apartheid. The report claims Rembrandt should pay back roughly R2.2 billion for its involvement.[8]
In March 2007, Richemont and Polo Ralph Lauren Inc. announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, the Polo Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company SÀRL.[9]
In October 2008, the Group divested all of its remaining interests in the tobacco industry.[10]
As of November 2012[update], Compagnie Financière Richemont SA is the sixth largest corporation by market capitalization in the Swiss Market Index.[11] As of 2014, Richemont is the second-largest luxury goods company in the world after LVMH.[3]
Organization[edit]

History[edit]
Johann Rupert founded Compagnie Financière Richemont SA in 1988 when he spun off the international assets of Rembrandt Group Ltd. (now Remgro Limited), a South Africa-based company founded in the 1940s by his father, Dr. Anton Rupert.[4][5] The luxury goods investments of Rembrandt Group combined with Rothmans International formed the initial group of Richemont subsidiaries.[6][7]
According to a state ordered investigation conducted by Ciex and published in 1999, Rembrandt played a part in the 'Bankorp deal' in which several leading South African financial bodies conspired to steal R26 billion from the state during apartheid. The report claims Rembrandt should pay back roughly R2.2 billion for its involvement.[8]
In March 2007, Richemont and Polo Ralph Lauren Inc. announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, the Polo Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company SÀRL.[9]
In October 2008, the Group divested all of its remaining interests in the tobacco industry.[10]

In 2015, the Net-a-Porter Group was merged with the YOOX Group in an all-share transaction. Richemont is the largest shareholder in the enlarged Group.[1][26]
Website blocking[edit]
In October 2014 the first blocking order against trademark infringing consumer goods was passed against the major UK ISPs by Richemont, Cartier International and Montblanc to block several domains selling trademark infringing products.[27]

History[edit]
Johann Rupert founded Compagnie Financière Richemont SA in 1988 when he spun off the international assets of Rembrandt Group Ltd. (now Remgro Limited), a South Africa-based company founded in the 1940s by his father, Dr. Anton Rupert.[4][5] The luxury goods investments of Rembrandt Group combined with Rothmans International formed the initial group of Richemont subsidiaries.[6][7]
According to a state ordered investigation conducted by Ciex and published in 1999, Rembrandt played a part in the 'Bankorp deal' in which several leading South African financial bodies conspired to steal R26 billion from the state during apartheid. The report claims Rembrandt should pay back roughly R2.2 billion for its involvement.[8]
In March 2007, Richemont and Polo Ralph Lauren Inc. announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, the Polo Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company SÀRL.[9]
In October 2008, the Group divested all of its remaining interests in the tobacco industry.[10]
As of November 2012[update], Compagnie Financière Richemont SA is the sixth largest corporation by market capitalization in the Swiss Market Index.[11] As of 2014, Richemont is the second-largest luxury goods company in the world after LVMH.[3]
Organization[edit]
Compagnie Financière Richemont SA organizes its business activities into three operating divisions: Jewellery Maisons, Specialist Watchmakers and Other Businesses.[1]

The Other Businesses division includes Azzedine Alaïa, Chloé, Dunhill, Lancel, Montblanc, Peter Millar, Purdey and Shanghai Tang.[1]
Ownership and control[edit]
The largest significant shareholder of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA is Compagnie Financière Rupert, a Swiss company that holds shares controlled and principally owned by Johann Rupert. Compagnie Financière Rupert owns 522,000,000 Class "B" shares of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, representing 9.1% of the equity and 50% of the voting rights.

History[edit]
Johann Rupert founded Compagnie Financière Richemont SA in 1988 when he spun off the international assets of Rembrandt Group Ltd. (now Remgro Limited), a South Africa-based company founded in the 1940s by his father, Dr. Anton Rupert.[4][5] The luxury goods investments of Rembrandt Group combined with Rothmans International formed the initial group of Richemont subsidiaries.[6][7]
According to a state ordered investigation conducted by Ciex and published in 1999, Rembrandt played a part in the 'Bankorp deal' in which several leading South African financial bodies conspired to steal R26 billion from the state during apartheid. The report claims Rembrandt should pay back roughly R2.2 billion for its involvement.[8]
In March 2007, Richemont and Polo Ralph Lauren Inc. announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, the Polo Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company SÀRL.[9]
In October 2008, the Group divested all of its remaining interests in the tobacco industry.[10]
As of November 2012[update], Compagnie Financière Richemont SA is the sixth largest corporation by market capitalization in the Swiss Market Index.[11] As of 2014, Richemont is the second-largest luxury goods company in the world after LVMH.[3]

History[edit]
Johann Rupert founded Compagnie Financière Richemont SA in 1988 when he spun off the international assets of Rembrandt Group Ltd. (now Remgro Limited), a South Africa-based company founded in the 1940s by his father, Dr. Anton Rupert.[4][5] The luxury goods investments of Rembrandt Group combined with Rothmans International formed the initial group of Richemont subsidiaries.[6][7]
According to a state ordered investigation conducted by Ciex and published in 1999, Rembrandt played a part in the 'Bankorp deal' in which several leading South African financial bodies conspired to steal R26 billion from the state during apartheid. The report claims Rembrandt should pay back roughly R2.2 billion for its involvement.[8]
In March 2007, Richemont and Polo Ralph Lauren Inc. announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, the Polo Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company SÀRL.[9]
In October 2008, the Group divested all of its remaining interests in the tobacco industry.[10]
As of November 2012[update], Compagnie Financière Richemont SA is the sixth largest corporation by market capitalization in the Swiss Market Index.[11] As of 2014, Richemont is the second-largest luxury goods company in the world after LVMH.[3]
Organization[edit]
Compagnie Financière Richemont SA organizes its business activities into three operating divisions: Jewellery Maisons, Specialist Watchmakers and Other Businesses.[1]
Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, and Giampiero Bodino constitute the Jewellery Maisons.
The Specialist Watchmakers group is composed of A. Lange & Söhne, Baume & Mercier, IWC Schaffhausen, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Officine Panerai, Piaget, Roger Dubuis, Vacheron Constantin and the joint venture with the Ralph Lauren Watch & Jewelry Co.
The Other Businesses division includes Azzedine Alaïa, Chloé, Dunhill, Lancel, Montblanc, Peter Millar, Purdey and Shanghai Tang.[1]
Ownership and control[edit]
The largest significant shareholder of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA is Compagnie Financière Rupert, a Swiss company that holds shares controlled and principally owned by Johann Rupert. Compagnie Financière Rupert owns 522,000,000 Class "B" shares of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, representing 9.1% of the equity and 50% of the voting rights. Johann Rupert and Compagnie Financière Rupert also hold 2,836,664 class "A" shares or "A" share equivalents as of the end of March 2016.[12]

History[edit]
Johann Rupert founded Compagnie Financière Richemont SA in 1988 when he spun off the international assets of Rembrandt Group Ltd. (now Remgro Limited), a South Africa-based company founded in the 1940s by his father, Dr. Anton Rupert.[4][5] The luxury goods investments of Rembrandt Group combined with Rothmans International formed the initial group of Richemont subsidiaries.[6][7]
According to a state ordered investigation conducted by Ciex and published in 1999, Rembrandt played a part in the 'Bankorp deal' in which several leading South African financial bodies conspired to steal R26 billion from the state during apartheid. The report claims Rembrandt should pay back roughly R2.2 billion for its involvement.[8]
In March 2007, Richemont and Polo Ralph Lauren Inc. announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, the Polo Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company SÀRL.[9]
In October 2008, the Group divested all of its remaining interests in the tobacco industry.[10]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
