Lawrence R’s Review 

Ordering and fulfillment were easy and flawless. Set up of grill was simple and quick.
My first test, and only so far, was to grill a well aged and marbled ribeye to rare perfection. I used a thermometer to monitor the internal temperature of the meat but had no idea what the temperature gradient might be using this new grill so I had to guess when to turn the steak. Unfortunately, I waited a bit long on the first side and was unable to grill both sides evenly as a result. My suggestion to others is to turn the meat before the internal temperature gets above 100 deg F because the first side will be nicely charred before you know it. You can always turn the meat again to even it out without risking overcharging one side.
Because there is virtually no smoke and absolutely no flare-up, there is a noticeable absence of the typical “smoke” flavor. Absent that, the meat was wonderful!

Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.
