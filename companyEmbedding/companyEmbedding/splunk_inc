History[edit]
Michael Baum, Rob Das and Erik Swan co-founded Splunk Inc in 2003.[6] Venture firms August Capital, Seven Rosen, Ignition Partners and JK&B Capital backed the company.
By 2007 Splunk had raised 40 million USD;[7] it became profitable in 2009.[8] In 2012 Splunk had its initial public offering, trading under NASDAQ symbol SPLK.[9]
In September 2013 the company acquired Bugsense, a mobile-device data-analytics company.[10] Bugsense provides "a mobile analytics platform used by developers to improve app performance and improve quality". It supplied a "software developer kit" to give developers access to data analytics from mobile devices that it managed from its scalable cloud platform.[11] The acquisition amount was undisclosed.
In July 2015 Splunk acquired Caspida, a cybersecurity startup, for $190 million.[12]
In October 2015 Splunk sealed a "cybersecurity alliance" with U.S. government security contractor Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. to offer combined cyberthreat detection and intelligence-analysis technology.[13]
According to Glassdoor, it is the fourth highest-paying company for employees in the United States as of April 2017.[14]
Products[edit]
Splunk's core offering, Splunk Enterprise, collects and analyzes high volumes of machine-generated data. It uses a standard API to connect directly to applications and devices.[15] It was developed in response to the demand for comprehensible and actionable data reporting for executives outside a company's IT department.[16][17]
In 2011, Splunk released Splunk Storm, a cloud-based version of the core Splunk product. Splunk Storm offered a turnkey, managed and hosted service for machine data.[18] In 2013, Splunk announced that Splunk Storm would become a completely free service and expanded its cloud offering with Splunk Cloud.[19] In 2015, Splunk shut down Splunk Storm.[20]
In 2013, Splunk announced a product called Hunk: Splunk Analytics for Hadoop, which supports accessing, searching, and reporting on external data sets located in Hadoop from a Splunk interface.[21]
In 2015, Splunk announced a Light version of the core Splunk product, aimed at smaller IT-environments and mid-sized enterprises.[22]
In 2016, Google announced its cloud platform will integrate with Splunk to expand in areas like IT ops, security, and compliance.[23]

Investor Relations






Splunk was founded to pursue a disruptive new vision: make machine data accessible, usable and valuable to everyone. Machine data is one of the fastest growing and most pervasive segments of "big data"--generated by websites, applications, servers, networks, mobile devices and the like that organizations rely on every day. By monitoring and analyzing everything from customer clickstreams and transactions to network activity and call records--and more, Splunk turns machine data into valuable insights no matter what business you're in. It's what we call operational intelligence.

Our Values

Innovative
• Passionate
• Disruptive
• Open
• Fun







 
 
 
 
 

Innovative
“We are a game-changing technology creatively solving customer problems.”

We often ask customers: “What did you do before Splunk?” The answers range from: “spent hours solving problems,” “lacked visibility,” to “didn't solve problems,” “guessed,” “estimated.” We help our customers solve any number of problems in ways they could never dream before—because we take the time to listen. With Splunk, all they need is a browser and their imagination.





Passionate
“People + Product + Passion = Splunk”

You can have the best people and the best product in the world, but without passion, you can't call it Splunk. Passion is the single most valuable element of our culture. It's the one emotion which all Splunkers possess the most of, the quality that drives us further and enables us to reach higher. It's the reason we get excited to share Splunk with anyone who will listen and it's the reason we keep striving every day to protect what Splunk is and improve what Splunk does. And if you don't believe it, just ask us to tell you about Splunk and see what happens.





Disruptive
“We strive to lead, not follow, while continuing to disrupt the market.”

We have never settled for the status quo. We look at a problem and ask, “How can we do that better?” We recognize when we (or others) fail to execute, learn from those lessons—and submit a new, better solution to the problem. We continually reevaluate the solution to ensure it is still the best answer and tweak it to take advantage of new pieces of information.





Open
“We are open and honest in our interactions.”

We keep it real by being open and honest. We are a collaborative team that understands the value in open communication—it's how we interact with our customers. We have an open door policy—and we like it that way. At Splunk, our customers are number one and that's how they are treated.





Fun
“We are committed to this environment of having fun and working hard at the same time.”

“Work hard, play harder” has been a phrase used at Splunk since the time when we all sat in the same office and had to build our own desks. We are a company that recognizes that we are only as good as those around us. People who do not look forward to representing Splunk every day are not the type of people that will catapult us to the upper echelons of success. We are committed to having every employee WANT to give it their all, be respectful and a part of this family, and have a smile on their face while doing it.

Best Places to Work

Splunk has been named as one of the "Best Places to Work" in the Bay Area by the San Francisco Business Times. This is the 10th consecutive year Splunk has been named a top Bay Area employer. We're honored to once again land at the top of the list for our exceptional culture. This year's list highlights employee satisfaction in areas such as personal and professional growth, workplace satisfaction and overall team effectiveness.

Access from Anywhere











Collect and Index Data
Index data regardless of format or location – logs, clickstreams, sensors, stream network traffic, web servers, custom applications, hypervisors, social media, and cloud services. Because the structure and schema are applied only at search time you can analyze the data without limitation.






 




Search and Investigate
Search data using the powerful and intuitive Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL™). Splunk automatically normalizes your varying data formats and provides 140+ commands so you can perform statistical searches, calculate metrics and even look for specific conditions within a rolling time window.  Zoom in and out on timelines to automatically reveal trends, spikes and patterns and click to drill down into search results.






 




Correlate and Analyze
Splunk makes it easy to find relationships between events or activities. Correlate based on time, location, or custom search results. Use the Transaction command to identify related events as a transaction or session and investigate failed transactions. Enable users to discover and share insights with the point-and-click ease of the Tables and Pivot interfaces. Use the power of machine learning to automatically identify anomalies and incidents.






 




Visualize and Report
Visualize trends and characteristics in custom dashboards and reports suited to any business, operational or security need. Analyze further with chart overlay and pan and zoom controls. Predictive visualizations let you forecast highs and lows, plan system resources and anticipate workloads. You can also personalize dashboards and reports for anyone, share them as PDFs, or embed them into other applications.






 




Monitor and Alert
Turn searches into real-time alerts and automatically trigger notifications via email or RSS; then execute remedial actions, send an SNMP trap or generate a trouble ticket. Alerts can be triggered based on a variety of thresholds, trend-based conditions and other complex criteria. Gain additional information at the time of the alert to assist with faster root cause analysis and problem resolution.






 




Access from Anywhere
Administrators and users can securely access Splunk Enterprise via any standard browser. Splunk Mobile Access enables users to view, interact with and share Splunk operational intelligence using Apple iOS or Android mobile devices. Tailored alerts and views enable managers to track and act on key performance indicators and enable front-line administrators to monitor and investigate operational status from any location.

“We have compared costs to other solutions including open source and Splunk has a lower total cost of ownership.”
Ed Bailey, enterprise architect, TransUnion












An Enterprise-Class Architecture
 The enterprise machine data fabric provides a flexible data architecture that facilitates insights from your data to provide Operational Intelligence.







Any Machine Data
										Using no predefined schema, Splunk Universal Forwarders and collection methods such as syslog, HTTP direct API, scripted inputs, and the mobile SDK can index unstructured data from sources such as applications, sensors, endpoint devices, mainframes, industrial systems and network packet streams. Splunk can also combine your machine data with data in your relational databases, data warehouses, and Hadoop and NoSQL data stores.
										







Enterprise-Class High Availability and Scale
										Multi-site clustering and automatic load balancing scale to support hundreds of terabytes of data per day, optimize response times and provide continuous availability. Search Head Clustering provides support for a virtually unlimited number of concurrent users and searches. The High Performance Analytics Store and other acceleration technologies enable you to generate reports on big data at lightning fast speeds. 
										







Security and Administration
										A robust security model provides secure data transfer, granular role-based access controls, LDAP integration and single sign-on, auditability and data integrity. Every transaction is authenticated, whether through the web and mobile interfaces, command line interface or the Splunk Enterprise API. The distributed management console provides enterprise-wide administration and maintains a complete, signed audit trail of administrative actions and search history.
										







Splunkbase Apps and Add-Ons
										Apps from Splunk, our partners and our community enhance and extend the power of the Splunk platform. Optimize data collection and analysis from your favorite sources. Empower users with pre-built visualizations and functions for security, IT management, business analysis and more. Whatever your need, these apps help you get powerful results right out of the box. Browse Splunkbase to take advantage of the hundreds of apps and add-ons that you can immediately use with Splunk.
										
Learn More







Open Development Platform
										The Splunk platform makes it easy  to customize Splunk Enterprise to meet the needs of any project. Developers can build custom Splunk applications or integrate Splunk data into other applications by using the Splunk REST API or SDKs for JavaScript, JSON, Java, Python, Ruby and PHP.  Your custom applications can leverage the rich functionality of the Splunk platform as well as existing applications available in the Splunk applications library.
										
Learn More







Enterprise Integration
										Splunk Enterprise is the foundation for your enterprise-wide Operational Intelligence. Embed Splunk reports and data in any application. Enrich your relational databases and reports with Splunk insights, trigger actions in ticketing or other systems, or use our ODBC integrations to access Splunk Operational Intelligence in familiar applications such as Microsoft Excel or Tableau.
