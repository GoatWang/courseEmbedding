			DANIEL K. SPIEGELMAN has been a member of our board of directors since June 2008.

From October 2009 to May 2012, Mr. Spiegelman served as the chief executive officer of Filtini, Inc., a start-up company developing next generation circulating tumor cell capture and analysis technology.

From 1998 to 2009, Mr. Spiegelman was employed at CV Therapeutics, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company acquired in 2009 by Gilead, most recently as senior vice president and chief financial officer. From 1992 to 1998, Mr. Spiegelman was an employee at Genentech, Inc., a biotechnology company, serving most recently as its treasurer. Mr. Spiegelman previously served as a member of the boards of directors of Affymax, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company and Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a private biopharmaceutical company. Our corporate governance and nominating committee believes that Mr. Spiegelman's qualifications for membership on the board of directors include his extensive background in the financial and commercial issues facing growing biotechnology companies. Additionally, as chief financial officer of CV Therapeutics prior to its sale to Gilead Sciences, Mr. Spiegelman was involved in transitioning the company from a research and development focus to a commercial entity with two approved products. This experience allows Mr. Spiegelman to provide our board of directors with significant insights into financial strategy and organizational development. Mr. Spiegelman received his B.A. and M.B.A. from Stanford University.
