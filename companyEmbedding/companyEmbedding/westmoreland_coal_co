About Us

Westmoreland Coal Company began mining in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in 1854 as a Pennsylvania corporation. In 1910, we incorporated in Delaware and continued our focus on underground coal operations in Pennsylvania and the Appalachian Basin. We moved our headquarters from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Colorado in 1995. Today, we are an energy company with 17 coal mines in the U.S. and Canada, a stake in an activated carbon plant and char production facility and two coal-fired power generation units. Our headquarters are located in Englewood, Colorado and we have approximately 3,100 employees.
We believe we are now the sixth largest North American coal producer (as measured by 2013 production of nearly 52 million tons, including Sherritt 2013 production), and we believe that we are the largest dragline operator among North American coal producers with 29 draglines owned or operated. We produce and sell thermal coal primarily to investment grade power plants under long-term cost-protected contracts, as well as to industrial customers and barbeque briquettes manufacturers. We operate 13 surface mines and a 50% interest in an activated carbon plant and char production facility. Our U.S. coal operations are located in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota and Texas. Our Canadian coal operations are located in Alberta and Saskatchewan. We own a thermal coal export mine with production capacity of three million tonnes per annum and with established sales to the Asian markets. We also operate two coal-fired power generating units in North Carolina with a total capacity of approximately 230 megawatts.
Westmoreland is publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol WLB and has over 16 million shares of common stock outstanding.

1976


Colorado Westmoreland, Inc., is incorporated to mine steam coal in the Grand Mesa coalfields near Paonia, Colorado to begin development of its Orchard Valley Mine.

1972


Westmoreland and Penn Virginia Corporation decide to effect a more complete separation of the two firms.

1970


Westmoreland Resources, Inc. is formed to mine coal in Montana on the Crow Tribe land in Big Horn County, Montana.

1968


The Company purchases more West Virginia mines from Sprague & Sons and Imperial Smokeless Coal Company, effectively doubling the size of the Company, making Westmoreland the largest “coal-only” firm in the industry.

1964


The old Westmoreland Coal Company is merged into the Stonega Coke and Coal Company, but is re-titled the Westmoreland Coal Company to retain the name that was then the oldest in the industry. Virginia Coal and Iron Company absorbs Westmoreland Inc., which later becomes Penn Virginia Corporation, a land, mineral rights, and investment company.

1957


The Hutchinson leasehold is sold, ending a century of operations in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.

1929


Company President, S.P. Hutchinson, dies unexpectedly. The remaining Directors turn over the Company’s management to the Stonega Coke and Coal Company’s management headed by E.B. Leisenring, Sr., Chairman of the Board. The Company’s offices are moved from its 224 South 3rd Street location to the Fidelity Building in Philadelphia. New management keeps the Company solvent through the Depression and World War II.

1917


Westmoreland acquires the remaining Penn Gas shares, thus paving the way for a merger of all three firms – Westmoreland, Penn Gas, and Manor Gas – effective January 1, 1918.

1916


Dr. Wentz is the single largest shareholder in the Company and becomes a Director in 1917. 

1913


The Company’s peak production of 4.8 million tons rapidly depletes the Irwin Basin and electricity, natural gas, and petroleum products destroy the gaslight market.

1910


Westmoreland begins land purchases in West Virginia.

1900


Westmoreland begins negotiations to buy controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal Company. The transaction is completed in 1905. The purchase is financed by an issue of $2 million in stock and $1 million in 4.25% notes. Penn Gas owned one-third interest in Manor Gas Coal Company.

1885


Steam locomotives, used for hauling coal with underground wire ropes (versus the previous method of using mules), were introduced at the Larimer Mine. The Company begins shipments to the West Indies, South America, and the Mediterranean.

1883


The Irwin Basin is successfully organized by the Amalgamated Association of Miners, which later becomes the United Mine Workers of America in 1890.

1880s


Development of natural gas fields around Pittsburgh and competition from steam coal and coking coal regions start to depress the gas coal markets.

1875


Westmoreland and neighboring Penn Gas Coal Company enjoy a near monopoly of the gas coal market. The two are the largest bituminous coal companies in the state.

1871


Westmoreland Coal is shipped to New York City and enters into long-term contracts with Carnegie Brothers & Company to supply their steel mills in the Pittsburgh area.

1870


Westmoreland establishes a relief fund (the precursor to Workman’s Compensation) where the Company and employees each contribute 25 cents per month to the fund.

1866


The Company begins experimenting with mechanical mining techniques like the use of the “Green & Boyd Cutting Machine,” the “Harrison Pick Machine,” and the “Jeffrey Cutting Machine.”

1863


Coal shipments are delayed/stopped as Pennsylvania Railroad locomotives and rail cars are repositioned north to prevent their capture. General Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia marches towards the north to engage the Union Army in Pennsylvania. Both armies meet in Gettysburg on July 1. Coal shipments resume after bridges are rebuilt.

1856


Westmoreland contributes indirectly to the growth of the American gaslight industry by furnishing coal to 22 gas companies. By 1861, it is supplying 69 gasworks from Maine to Georgia. Production swells from 90,000 tons to 280,000 tons in 1869. The Pennsylvania Railroad to Philadelphia and Baltimore ships all of the Company’s coal.

1854


Westmoreland Coal Company is incorporated under Pennsylvania’s General Mining Law by John Covode, William Larimer, Herman Haupt, John Scott, and James Magee. All were directly connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad and part of the Philadelphia merchant, banking, and business communities. The formation of the Company was one of the many outgrowths of the completion of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which opened the first all-rail link between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in 1852.
General Larimer
A Westmoreland County businessman and Treasurer of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroads. He moves to Colorado and builds the first house in what later becomes Denver, Colorado.
John Covode
Elected to Congress in 1854, he becomes the first President of the Company.
James Magee
A Philadelphia merchant who succeeded John Covode in 1856, he is one of the organizers of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Mining Operations — Westmoreland Coal Company































Menu ▼
Mining Operations

Coal Overview
The Company’s mining operations include Westmoreland Mining LLC, which through its subsidiaries, operates four mining complexes in the United States, Prairie Mines & Royalty ULC, which operates five mining complexes in Canada, Westmoreland Resources, Inc., which operates the Absaloka Mine, Westmoreland Kemmerer, Inc., which operates the Kemmerer Mine, and Coal Valley Resources Inc., which operates the Coal Valley Mine. The mining operations are described below.
The Company’s 12 surface mine complexes enjoy significant transportation and logistical advantages to their principal customers, which reduce exposure to competition, and long-term coal sales contracts promote stable long-term earnings and cash flows. Westmoreland’s mines are located adjacent to, or only a short conveyor, truck or rail haul from their primary customers, with the exception of the Coal Valley mine, which exports coal to power utilities in the Asia-Pacific region. The majority of the Company’s coal production is sold under long-term contracts of one year or greater which, as they expire, are anticipated to be followed by extensions, new contracts or spot sales at prices reflecting then current market conditions. Pricing changes periodically under existing contracts as a result of adjustment provisions for cost and market variances.
Westmoreland Mining LLC (WML)

Rosebud Mine
Jewett Mine
Beulah Mine
Savage Mine

WML was formed as a separate subsidiary of Westmoreland Coal Company in 2001 to facilitate the acquisitions of the operating coal business of Entech, Inc., a subsidiary of Montana Power, and the coal assets of Knife River Corporation, a subsidiary of MDU Resources. WML’s subsidiaries are Western Energy Company (Rosebud Mine), Texas Westmoreland Coal Co. (Jewett Mine), Dakota Westmoreland Corporation (Beulah Mine), and Westmoreland Savage Corporation (Savage Mine).
Prairie Mines & Royalty ULC (PMRULC)

Estevan Mine
Genesee Mine
Paintearth Mine
Poplar River Mine
Sheerness Mine

PMRULC was formed in 2014 as part of Westmoreland’s expansion into Canada with the acquisition of five coal mines in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. PMRULC supplies coal to domestic power stations under long term coal supply agreements with ATCO and Saskpower, and a joint venture arrangement with Capital Power Corporation. PMRULC also supplies coal for the manufacture of activated carbon in a Joint Venture agreement with Cabot Norit Canada, and char for the manufacture of charcoal briquettes.
Westmoreland Resources, Inc. (WRI)

Absaloka Mine

WRI was formed by Westmoreland and a group of partners to lease coal reserves from the Crow Tribe of Indians in Montana and develop the Absaloka Mine in the early 1970’s. WRI shipped its first coal from the mine in 1974. Over the years, Westmoreland acquired the partnership interests of others and, as part of its renewal strategy, increased its ownership to 100% in October 2007. Unlike Westmoreland’s other mining operations that supply contiguous power generation facilities, the coal produced at this mine requires rail transport to its principal customers in Minnesota. WRI enjoys a proximity advantage to this customer relative to its main competitors.
Westmoreland Kemmerer, Inc. (WKI)

Kemmerer Mine

WKI was formed to acquire the assets of the Kemmerer Mine from Chevron Mining in 2012.  Unlike Westmoreland Coal Company’s other mines that use draglines for mining, Kemmerer is a truck and shovel operation.  The Kemmerer Mine is a 13,400-acre mine complex located in the southwest corner of Wyoming.  It supplies coal to the Naughton Power Station by overland conveyor and to a number of industrial customers either by rail or truck.
Coal Valley Resources Inc. (CVRI)

Coal Valley Mine

CVRI was acquired by the Westmoreland Coal Company in 2014 as part of the acquisition of Canadian coal assets from Sherritt International. Unlike the majority of Westmoreland Coal Company’s mines, CVRI produces a thermal coal for both international and domestic consumption. The Coal Valley mine utilizes both dragline and truck and shovel methods to mine steeply dipping coal seams adjacent to the Rocky Mountains.

About Us

Westmoreland Coal Company began mining in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in 1854 as a Pennsylvania corporation. In 1910, we incorporated in Delaware and continued our focus on underground coal operations in Pennsylvania and the Appalachian Basin. We moved our headquarters from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Colorado in 1995. Today, we are an energy company with 17 coal mines in the U.S. and Canada, a stake in an activated carbon plant and char production facility and two coal-fired power generation units. Our headquarters are located in Englewood, Colorado and we have approximately 3,100 employees.
We believe we are now the sixth largest North American coal producer (as measured by 2013 production of nearly 52 million tons, including Sherritt 2013 production), and we believe that we are the largest dragline operator among North American coal producers with 29 draglines owned or operated. We produce and sell thermal coal primarily to investment grade power plants under long-term cost-protected contracts, as well as to industrial customers and barbeque briquettes manufacturers. We operate 13 surface mines and a 50% interest in an activated carbon plant and char production facility. Our U.S. coal operations are located in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota and Texas. Our Canadian coal operations are located in Alberta and Saskatchewan. We own a thermal coal export mine with production capacity of three million tonnes per annum and with established sales to the Asian markets. We also operate two coal-fired power generating units in North Carolina with a total capacity of approximately 230 megawatts.
Westmoreland is publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol WLB and has over 16 million shares of common stock outstanding.

Mining Operations — Westmoreland Coal Company































Menu ▼
Mining Operations

Coal Overview
The Company’s mining operations include Westmoreland Mining LLC, which through its subsidiaries, operates four mining complexes in the United States, Prairie Mines & Royalty ULC, which operates five mining complexes in Canada, Westmoreland Resources, Inc., which operates the Absaloka Mine, Westmoreland Kemmerer, Inc., which operates the Kemmerer Mine, and Coal Valley Resources Inc., which operates the Coal Valley Mine. The mining operations are described below.
The Company’s 12 surface mine complexes enjoy significant transportation and logistical advantages to their principal customers, which reduce exposure to competition, and long-term coal sales contracts promote stable long-term earnings and cash flows. Westmoreland’s mines are located adjacent to, or only a short conveyor, truck or rail haul from their primary customers, with the exception of the Coal Valley mine, which exports coal to power utilities in the Asia-Pacific region. The majority of the Company’s coal production is sold under long-term contracts of one year or greater which, as they expire, are anticipated to be followed by extensions, new contracts or spot sales at prices reflecting then current market conditions. Pricing changes periodically under existing contracts as a result of adjustment provisions for cost and market variances.
Westmoreland Mining LLC (WML)

Rosebud Mine
Jewett Mine
Beulah Mine
Savage Mine

WML was formed as a separate subsidiary of Westmoreland Coal Company in 2001 to facilitate the acquisitions of the operating coal business of Entech, Inc., a subsidiary of Montana Power, and the coal assets of Knife River Corporation, a subsidiary of MDU Resources. WML’s subsidiaries are Western Energy Company (Rosebud Mine), Texas Westmoreland Coal Co. (Jewett Mine), Dakota Westmoreland Corporation (Beulah Mine), and Westmoreland Savage Corporation (Savage Mine).
Prairie Mines & Royalty ULC (PMRULC)

Estevan Mine
Genesee Mine
Paintearth Mine
Poplar River Mine
Sheerness Mine

PMRULC was formed in 2014 as part of Westmoreland’s expansion into Canada with the acquisition of five coal mines in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. PMRULC supplies coal to domestic power stations under long term coal supply agreements with ATCO and Saskpower, and a joint venture arrangement with Capital Power Corporation. PMRULC also supplies coal for the manufacture of activated carbon in a Joint Venture agreement with Cabot Norit Canada, and char for the manufacture of charcoal briquettes.
Westmoreland Resources, Inc. (WRI)

Absaloka Mine

WRI was formed by Westmoreland and a group of partners to lease coal reserves from the Crow Tribe of Indians in Montana and develop the Absaloka Mine in the early 1970’s. WRI shipped its first coal from the mine in 1974. Over the years, Westmoreland acquired the partnership interests of others and, as part of its renewal strategy, increased its ownership to 100% in October 2007. Unlike Westmoreland’s other mining operations that supply contiguous power generation facilities, the coal produced at this mine requires rail transport to its principal customers in Minnesota. WRI enjoys a proximity advantage to this customer relative to its main competitors.
Westmoreland Kemmerer, Inc. (WKI)

Kemmerer Mine

WKI was formed to acquire the assets of the Kemmerer Mine from Chevron Mining in 2012.  Unlike Westmoreland Coal Company’s other mines that use draglines for mining, Kemmerer is a truck and shovel operation.  The Kemmerer Mine is a 13,400-acre mine complex located in the southwest corner of Wyoming.  It supplies coal to the Naughton Power Station by overland conveyor and to a number of industrial customers either by rail or truck.
Coal Valley Resources Inc. (CVRI)

Coal Valley Mine

CVRI was acquired by the Westmoreland Coal Company in 2014 as part of the acquisition of Canadian coal assets from Sherritt International. Unlike the majority of Westmoreland Coal Company’s mines, CVRI produces a thermal coal for both international and domestic consumption. The Coal Valley mine utilizes both dragline and truck and shovel methods to mine steeply dipping coal seams adjacent to the Rocky Mountains.

The Westmoreland County coal strike of 1910–1911, or the Westmoreland coal miners' strike,[1] was a strike by coal miners represented by the United Mine Workers of America. The strike is also known as the Slovak Strike because about 70 percent of the miners were Slovak immigrants.[2] It began in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1910, and ended on July 1, 1911. At its height, the strike encompassed 65 mines and 15,000 coal miners.[2][3] Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.[4] The strike ended in defeat for the union.

Background[edit]
The Irwin gas coal basin is an area in Westmoreland and Venango Counties, Pennsylvania. It encompasses the townships of North Huntingdon, Penn, Sewickley, Salem, South Huntingdon, Hempfield and Irwin, and the boroughs of Murrysville, Export and Delmont. The coal mined in the district was unsuitable for use as coke. However, it was ideal for gasification and conversion into coal gas.[3]
Seven companies dominated coal mining in the Irwin Basin in 1910. In 1854, the Westmoreland Coal Company was formed to begin mining coal in the region. In 1905, it bought a controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal, a company established in 1861 to gasify coal. Penn Gas Coal, in turn, had obtained a one-third ownership in the Manor Gas Coal Company. Through these purchases, Westmoreland Coal had a near-monopoly on the gas coal market, and was the largest bituminous coal company in the Pennsylvania.[3][5] In 1892, Robert Jamison and his sons founded the Jamison Coal and Coke Company (originally the Jamison Coal Company).[6] In 1886, the Berwind family and Judge Allison White founded the Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.[7] In 1902, a number of smaller coal gas companies in and around Greensburg, Pennsylvania, merged to form the Keystone Coal and Coke Company. In 1905, Latrobe-Connellsville Coal and Coke Company was formed when Marcus W. Saxman merged three of his wholly owned or controlled coal companies.[8]
These companies were very paternalistic. Company towns (colloquially referred to as "coal patches") were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in company scrip.[3][9]
Origins of the strike[edit]
Coal miners increasingly agitated for improved wages and working conditions after 1900. Miners demanded an eight-hour day and wages equal to those paid in the nearby Pittsburgh coal basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought to be paid for mining "slack" (very fine coal), and for "dead work" (laying of track, shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay).[3]
Westmoreland Coal, Penn Gas Coal and Keystone Coal and Coke strongly resisted the miners' demands and any attempt at unionization. Companies used the Coal and Iron Police to physically intimidate and sometimes beat pro-union miners, workers were fired, and coal companies evicted families from the "coal patches" whenever miners struck.[3]
The situation came to a head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 cents per ton-and-a-half of coal mined. The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new safety lights and new forms of explosives—and pay for these items themselves.[2]
The strike[edit]
Miners' unions had tried to organize Westmoreland County coal mines since 1883, but had little success. In February 1910, however, the lower wage rates and new expenses led miners at Keystone Coal and Coke to meet and discuss their grievances among themselves. The miners decided to invite the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) to form a union.[2]
On March 7, 1910, Van Bittner, a UMWA vice president, arrived in Westmoreland County and formed a local union. Four hundred miners signed up and paid dues. Keystone Coke and Coal immediately fired 100 miners for attending the union organizing meeting. The Keystone miners walked off the job, and the strike swiftly spread throughout the Irwin Basin.[2]
Union recognition became the biggest issue in the strike. The workers felt that if they could win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.[2][10]
When the miners struck on March 9, the coal companies evicted thousands of families from their company-owned homes. UMWA spent $25,000 purchasing tents and constructing shanties, and set up 25 tent cities to accommodate the homeless. Near the town of Export, more than 100 tents went up, making it the largest tent city during the strike.[2][3]
Ethnic tension threatened to divide the nascent union. Slovakians comprised 70 percent of the striking miners, but the strike committee was led by native-born miners of English, German and Irish descent. UMWA organizers Bittner and Frank Hayes worked hard to overcome these divisions, however. Multi-lingual organizers were employed, each ethnic group elected its own representatives, and parades and rallies featured musicians and speakers from all groups.[2]
Public backing for the strike was high. Westmoreland County had a long history of support for unions. Local religious leaders signed petitions in favor of the union, testified before the United States Congress on behalf of workers, and called on the governor and state legislature to force the coal companies to submit to arbitration.[2]
UMWA support for the strike, however, was not nearly as strong. International union president Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to drum up increased support for the strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources.[2] Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers.[3] Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.[2]
Strikebreakers[edit]
To end the strike and break the union, the coal companies began importing thousands of Eastern European immigrants to work the mines. Coal company representatives on the East Coast promised immigrants a job and housing, and paid for them and their families to come to move to Pennsylvania. The flow of strikebreakers was small at first, but by the fall it was nearly a flood. The number of new immigrant workers was so large that the Penn Gas Coal company constructed 30 two-story houses in Hahntown to house its replacement workers, leading local residents to refer to the area as "Scab Hill."[3]
Management often took advantage of the strikebreakers, however. Company recruiters were ordered not to tell potential workers that they would be employed as strikebreakers. The coal companies sought out recent immigrants who did not speak English (or who spoke or understood it poorly), and then used this handicap against the strikebreakers. If workers tried to quit, the Coal and Iron Police prevented them from leaving and told them that they had to work off the cost of their transportation before resigning. When strikebreakers still tried to leave, the police beat them and forced them back to work. In some cases, fences were built around strikebreaker housing to intimidate the workers into staying. The abuse of strikebreakers was so severe that the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Labor held hearings on whether the coal companies had illegally forced people into peonage.[2][11][12][13]
Labor injunctions and other legal actions[edit]
Employers also turned to the courts for assistance. In April 1910, Keystone Coal and Coke sought a restraining order to prevent striking miners from approaching company property on the grounds that the number of strikers and the loud noises they made intimidated company employees. Although the local sheriff testified that the strikers had committed no acts of violence, the state district court issued a sweeping injunction which essentially barred the union from use of public roads:

Miners are restrained from conducting or engaging in marches to the mines, property and works of said Keystone Coal and Coke Company and from assembling at or near the works of said company for the purpose of holding meetings at such places at any time, and from assembling on the highways at such places where the employees of the said company ordinarily pass to and from their work, and from preventing said employees from going peaceably along said injunction: highways and also from attempting by noise, intimidation, threats, personal violence or by any other means to interfere with the employees of said company in their desire to labor or with any of the property of the said company until further order of this court.[14]

The vague terms of the injunction led law enforcement officials to arrest miners as much as a half mile from Keystone grounds. Other coal companies quickly asked for similar injunctions which "made marching, assembling or traversing public roads illegal."[10][15][16]
The coal companies moved aggressively to exploit the law in other ways as well. The Coal and Iron Police patrolled company property and denied admittance to union members and supporters. Union members were often arrested for using public roads which traversed company property.[17] Small towns and villages, often encircled by coal company land, became isolated and embattled. In Herminie, all citizens were required to obtain a pass from the local mine manager before leaving the village. Union members were denied the use of post offices or the ability to enter local courthouses, because these facilities were often on coal company property. Nearly 1,000 miners were ultimately arrested for trespass or disorderly conduct.[2][10] Simply walking home in a group from a union meeting on a public highway could earn a contempt citation and a $50 fine.[10][17]
In 1911, seven coal companies in Westmoreland County and Allegheny County sued the leaders of the strike. The coal companies claimed they had suffered economic losses as high as $500,000 due to the strike and strike-related property damage. Twenty-eight officers in nearby District 5 and 17 strike leaders in Westmoreland County were arrested on charges of conspiracy, intimidation, violence and general lawlessness. Local labor unions helped the 45 men post bond of $300 each, and instituted a special per capita assessment to form a legal defense fund. But the public outcry was so extraordinary that the coal companies dropped the suits.[2][10]
Use of security personnel[edit]
Employers also used force to intimidate striking miners. At their disposal were the Coal and Iron Police, local law enforcement personnel, and the Pennsylvania State Police.

The Coal and Iron Police primarily protected company property, protected strikebreakers, and kept strikebreakers from quitting.[3][10][13][17] But in many ways, their role in the strike was quite limited.
Sheriff's deputies and local police deputies proved to be a much bigger problem. The coal companies paid the Westmoreland County sheriff to provide deputies to protect their property and replacement workers (a common practice at the time). Although the sheriff's deputies would be acting under the color of law, they were paid for and under the control of the coal companies. The Westmoreland County sheriff obtained many deputies through "detective agencies" notorious of their strikebreaking activities, but nevertheless instructed the deputies to exercise restraint and ignore peaceful marches. He also warned them that he would dismiss deputies who committed acts of violence.[2]

Despite this, sheriff's deputies instigated and participated in three particularly violent and deadly incidents:

On May 8, 1910, sheriff's deputies attempted to prevent a handful of strikebreakers from permanently quitting their jobs at the Westmoreland Coal Company in the town of Yukon, Pennsylvania. About four hours after the replacement workers had returned to their boarding house, 25 sheriff's deputies and Pennsylvania state policemen broke into and searched the boarding house. A crowd of striking miners gathered and ridiculed their failure to find the workers. The furious and embarrassed sheriff's deputies then fired into the crowd. Thirty people were injured and one man killed.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff withdrew the commissions of 18 deputies involved in the incident, but the Westmoreland Coal Company had them sworn in as local police deputies instead.[2]
Shortly after the Yukon incident, a small group of miners walking home from a meeting in Export passed coal company property. A squad of 20 sheriff's deputies and State Police troopers attacked them. Several miners were severely beaten, and one miner (trying to protect a child in his arms) was killed.[2]
In July 1910, striking miners secured a march permit from the town of South Greensburg. As the miners began their march, deputy sheriffs and Coal and Iron Police on horseback stopped them. Although the local chief of police stepped forward and told the deputies that the miners had permission to march, the deputies ignored him and continued to block the marchers. The miners attempted to walk away, but the deputies charged into them with their horses, swinging clubs. A riot ensued and the sheriff's deputies fired into the crowd—killing a miner. When the chief of police attempted to arrest the deputy responsible, the other deputies seized him and charged him with obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty. Outraged citizens of the town mobbed the sheriff's office and forced his release.[2]

Problems with the deputies were so severe that in November 1910 the Westmoreland County sheriff stopped securing them for the coal companies. The companies responded by seeking deputies from local police forces instead.[2]
In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing striking miners as deputy sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriff's deputies were cited for contempt of court for venturing too close to coal company property. The sheriff said that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined them anyway.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways.[17]
The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) proved to be the most violent group during the strike. The PSP had been founded in 1905 to discourage the use of private police forces in workers' strikes and to provide law enforcement when local police or sheriffs were unable or unwilling to enforce the law. But rather than enforce the law, the PSP proved the group most willing to break it. One trooper described how the State Police dealt with strikers: "We ride in, scoop them up and beat hell out of them."[4][18]
The number of unprovoked violent acts committed by the PSP was extremely high and frequent. James Maurer, a socialist member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly from Reading, conducted a survey asking for information on State Police actions during the strike. Maurer's survey found that violence significantly increased after the arrival of the State Police, and that almost all acts of violence were committed by state troopers without provocation. Mauer was so outraged by the results of his survey that he introduced a bill to abolish the state police.[2] Hundreds of citizens later testified before state and federal commissions that mounted State Police routinely charged onto town sidewalks or into crowds, trampling and severely injuring men, women and children (whether strikers or not). Severe beatings with fists and clubs were common, with troopers breaking into and ransacking homes without warrants, beating citizens and striking miners alike. Local police officials claimed State Police routinely beat people on the street for no reason, and resisted local police attempts to stop them. State Police troopers shot up towns "in true Western style", and fired indiscriminately into crowds or into tent cities (killing and wounding sleeping women and children). Sexual assault (including rape) was disturbingly common, and at least one hotel manager accused troopers of promoting prostitution.[4]
State Police were also involved in a number of serious violent incidents, several of which resulted in the deaths of unarmed strikers:

In May 1910, State Police allegedly killed a man in cold blood. Several State Police officers and a coal company executive stopped and questioned four striking miners who did not speak English. An English-speaking miner who spoke their language came on the scene and told the four men to run off. They did so and escaped, but the State Police troopers chased the fifth man into a barn. The miner was shot and killed. The numerous witnesses testified that the miner was begging for his life when a State Trooper shot him. But the other troopers and a coal company executive stated that the miner was killed in self-defense, and the trooper was exonerated.[2][10]
In May 1911, State Police assaulted a group of striking miners on a public road. The miners, on their way to a meeting, walked past property owned by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The road narrowed where a creek ran past the property. The mounted State Police troopers blocked the mines' path at this point, then charged into the crowd. Two miners were shot and several severely beaten. A Westmoreland County sheriff's deputy accompany the miners was also badly beaten.[2][11]
In June 1911, miners secured a permit to march past facilities owned by the Penn Gas Coal Company. As the marchers peacefully walked past the company's front gate, State Police opened fire. More than 150 shots were fired, causing panic and several injuries. Westmoreland County sheriff's deputies (all miners) identified three of the troopers and went to Penn Gas Coal Company to arrest them. Instead, Pennsylvania State Police and Coal and Iron Police arrested the deputies for violating the court injunction. A court sentenced the deputies to five days in jail. When the Westmoreland County sheriff refused to put his deputies in jail, the court ordered the sheriff's arrest and charged him with malfeasance. Despite the pleas of a jury, the court sentenced the sheriff to one year and three months in solitary confinement and hard labor.[2][10]

During the strike, six striking miners, nine wives of striking miners, and one bystander were killed, and thousands of strikers and members of their families severely beaten or wounded.[2][4]
End of the strike[edit]
By mid-1911, the strike had taken its toll on the coal companies. At least $500,000 had been spent on security, and coal production had dropped by 45 percent.[3] The larger companies, however, used their financial reserves and income from non-mining operations (such as rental properties, company stores and even breweries) to withstand the economic pressure exerted by the miners. But all companies benefited from a significant slump in the demand for coal in 1910 and 1911, which leveled the playing field vis-a-vis their competitors.[2]
But the miners were worse off than the employers. The winter of 1910–11 was particularly cold, and the miners and their families suffered tremendously. The union built numerous shacks and shanties, and moved miners' families out of tents and into the shacks for better protection from the elements. But not enough shelter could be erected, and 400 families spent the entire winter in tents. Hunger and disease were also beginning to become widespread among strikers' families.[2][3]
In early 1911, the UMWA's support for the strikers appeared strong. In January 1911, Lewis lost the presidency of UMWA to John P. White. White fully backed the strike, and the UMWA convention reaffirmed the union's support for the miners.[2]
But just six months later, the UMWA called a halt to the strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in strike relief funds, but it was no longer financially able to keep the strike going.[2] On July 1, 1911, the UMWA executive board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.[2][3]
Women's resistance[edit]
The Westmoreland County coal strike was the setting for one of the more colorful incidents in the life of Mary Harris Jones, better known as "Mother Jones". Even though she was 73 years of age, Mother Jones agreed to travel to Westmoreland County to support the United Mine Workers in their strike.
Singing women[edit]
A number of miners' wives had been arrested in the summer of 1910 for harassing strikebreakers and company security personnel.[2]
Jones encouraged the women to bring their babies and small children with them when they were sentenced by the court in Greensburg. The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there was no one else to care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers.
While the women were being processed for imprisonment, Jones instructed them: "You sing the whole night long. You can spell one another if you get tired and hoarse. Sleep all day and sing all night and don't stop for anyone. Say you're singing to the babies. I will bring the little ones milk and fruit. Just you all sing and sing."[19]
Unfortunately, the jail was next door to the sheriff's home, as well as several hotels, lodging houses, and other homes. The sound of women singing all through the night kept most of the townspeople awake. After five days of sleeplessness, the townspeople angrily demanded that the judge order the women's release. He did so.[19]
The incident has become known as "the women who sang their way out of jail."

The Westmoreland County coal strike of 1910–1911, or the Westmoreland coal miners' strike,[1] was a strike by coal miners represented by the United Mine Workers of America. The strike is also known as the Slovak Strike because about 70 percent of the miners were Slovak immigrants.[2] It began in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1910, and ended on July 1, 1911. At its height, the strike encompassed 65 mines and 15,000 coal miners.[2][3] Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.[4] The strike ended in defeat for the union.

Background[edit]
The Irwin gas coal basin is an area in Westmoreland and Venango Counties, Pennsylvania. It encompasses the townships of North Huntingdon, Penn, Sewickley, Salem, South Huntingdon, Hempfield and Irwin, and the boroughs of Murrysville, Export and Delmont. The coal mined in the district was unsuitable for use as coke. However, it was ideal for gasification and conversion into coal gas.[3]
Seven companies dominated coal mining in the Irwin Basin in 1910. In 1854, the Westmoreland Coal Company was formed to begin mining coal in the region. In 1905, it bought a controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal, a company established in 1861 to gasify coal. Penn Gas Coal, in turn, had obtained a one-third ownership in the Manor Gas Coal Company. Through these purchases, Westmoreland Coal had a near-monopoly on the gas coal market, and was the largest bituminous coal company in the Pennsylvania.[3][5] In 1892, Robert Jamison and his sons founded the Jamison Coal and Coke Company (originally the Jamison Coal Company).[6] In 1886, the Berwind family and Judge Allison White founded the Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.[7] In 1902, a number of smaller coal gas companies in and around Greensburg, Pennsylvania, merged to form the Keystone Coal and Coke Company. In 1905, Latrobe-Connellsville Coal and Coke Company was formed when Marcus W. Saxman merged three of his wholly owned or controlled coal companies.[8]
These companies were very paternalistic. Company towns (colloquially referred to as "coal patches") were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in company scrip.[3][9]
Origins of the strike[edit]
Coal miners increasingly agitated for improved wages and working conditions after 1900. Miners demanded an eight-hour day and wages equal to those paid in the nearby Pittsburgh coal basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought to be paid for mining "slack" (very fine coal), and for "dead work" (laying of track, shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay).[3]
Westmoreland Coal, Penn Gas Coal and Keystone Coal and Coke strongly resisted the miners' demands and any attempt at unionization. Companies used the Coal and Iron Police to physically intimidate and sometimes beat pro-union miners, workers were fired, and coal companies evicted families from the "coal patches" whenever miners struck.[3]
The situation came to a head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 cents per ton-and-a-half of coal mined. The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new safety lights and new forms of explosives—and pay for these items themselves.[2]
The strike[edit]
Miners' unions had tried to organize Westmoreland County coal mines since 1883, but had little success. In February 1910, however, the lower wage rates and new expenses led miners at Keystone Coal and Coke to meet and discuss their grievances among themselves. The miners decided to invite the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) to form a union.[2]
On March 7, 1910, Van Bittner, a UMWA vice president, arrived in Westmoreland County and formed a local union. Four hundred miners signed up and paid dues. Keystone Coke and Coal immediately fired 100 miners for attending the union organizing meeting. The Keystone miners walked off the job, and the strike swiftly spread throughout the Irwin Basin.[2]
Union recognition became the biggest issue in the strike. The workers felt that if they could win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.[2][10]
When the miners struck on March 9, the coal companies evicted thousands of families from their company-owned homes. UMWA spent $25,000 purchasing tents and constructing shanties, and set up 25 tent cities to accommodate the homeless. Near the town of Export, more than 100 tents went up, making it the largest tent city during the strike.[2][3]
Ethnic tension threatened to divide the nascent union. Slovakians comprised 70 percent of the striking miners, but the strike committee was led by native-born miners of English, German and Irish descent. UMWA organizers Bittner and Frank Hayes worked hard to overcome these divisions, however. Multi-lingual organizers were employed, each ethnic group elected its own representatives, and parades and rallies featured musicians and speakers from all groups.[2]
Public backing for the strike was high. Westmoreland County had a long history of support for unions. Local religious leaders signed petitions in favor of the union, testified before the United States Congress on behalf of workers, and called on the governor and state legislature to force the coal companies to submit to arbitration.[2]
UMWA support for the strike, however, was not nearly as strong. International union president Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to drum up increased support for the strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources.[2] Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers.[3] Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.[2]
Strikebreakers[edit]
To end the strike and break the union, the coal companies began importing thousands of Eastern European immigrants to work the mines. Coal company representatives on the East Coast promised immigrants a job and housing, and paid for them and their families to come to move to Pennsylvania. The flow of strikebreakers was small at first, but by the fall it was nearly a flood. The number of new immigrant workers was so large that the Penn Gas Coal company constructed 30 two-story houses in Hahntown to house its replacement workers, leading local residents to refer to the area as "Scab Hill."[3]
Management often took advantage of the strikebreakers, however. Company recruiters were ordered not to tell potential workers that they would be employed as strikebreakers. The coal companies sought out recent immigrants who did not speak English (or who spoke or understood it poorly), and then used this handicap against the strikebreakers. If workers tried to quit, the Coal and Iron Police prevented them from leaving and told them that they had to work off the cost of their transportation before resigning. When strikebreakers still tried to leave, the police beat them and forced them back to work. In some cases, fences were built around strikebreaker housing to intimidate the workers into staying. The abuse of strikebreakers was so severe that the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Labor held hearings on whether the coal companies had illegally forced people into peonage.[2][11][12][13]
Labor injunctions and other legal actions[edit]
Employers also turned to the courts for assistance. In April 1910, Keystone Coal and Coke sought a restraining order to prevent striking miners from approaching company property on the grounds that the number of strikers and the loud noises they made intimidated company employees. Although the local sheriff testified that the strikers had committed no acts of violence, the state district court issued a sweeping injunction which essentially barred the union from use of public roads:

Miners are restrained from conducting or engaging in marches to the mines, property and works of said Keystone Coal and Coke Company and from assembling at or near the works of said company for the purpose of holding meetings at such places at any time, and from assembling on the highways at such places where the employees of the said company ordinarily pass to and from their work, and from preventing said employees from going peaceably along said injunction: highways and also from attempting by noise, intimidation, threats, personal violence or by any other means to interfere with the employees of said company in their desire to labor or with any of the property of the said company until further order of this court.[14]

The vague terms of the injunction led law enforcement officials to arrest miners as much as a half mile from Keystone grounds. Other coal companies quickly asked for similar injunctions which "made marching, assembling or traversing public roads illegal."[10][15][16]
The coal companies moved aggressively to exploit the law in other ways as well. The Coal and Iron Police patrolled company property and denied admittance to union members and supporters. Union members were often arrested for using public roads which traversed company property.[17] Small towns and villages, often encircled by coal company land, became isolated and embattled. In Herminie, all citizens were required to obtain a pass from the local mine manager before leaving the village. Union members were denied the use of post offices or the ability to enter local courthouses, because these facilities were often on coal company property. Nearly 1,000 miners were ultimately arrested for trespass or disorderly conduct.[2][10] Simply walking home in a group from a union meeting on a public highway could earn a contempt citation and a $50 fine.[10][17]
In 1911, seven coal companies in Westmoreland County and Allegheny County sued the leaders of the strike. The coal companies claimed they had suffered economic losses as high as $500,000 due to the strike and strike-related property damage. Twenty-eight officers in nearby District 5 and 17 strike leaders in Westmoreland County were arrested on charges of conspiracy, intimidation, violence and general lawlessness. Local labor unions helped the 45 men post bond of $300 each, and instituted a special per capita assessment to form a legal defense fund. But the public outcry was so extraordinary that the coal companies dropped the suits.[2][10]
Use of security personnel[edit]
Employers also used force to intimidate striking miners. At their disposal were the Coal and Iron Police, local law enforcement personnel, and the Pennsylvania State Police.

The Coal and Iron Police primarily protected company property, protected strikebreakers, and kept strikebreakers from quitting.[3][10][13][17] But in many ways, their role in the strike was quite limited.
Sheriff's deputies and local police deputies proved to be a much bigger problem. The coal companies paid the Westmoreland County sheriff to provide deputies to protect their property and replacement workers (a common practice at the time). Although the sheriff's deputies would be acting under the color of law, they were paid for and under the control of the coal companies. The Westmoreland County sheriff obtained many deputies through "detective agencies" notorious of their strikebreaking activities, but nevertheless instructed the deputies to exercise restraint and ignore peaceful marches. He also warned them that he would dismiss deputies who committed acts of violence.[2]

Despite this, sheriff's deputies instigated and participated in three particularly violent and deadly incidents:

On May 8, 1910, sheriff's deputies attempted to prevent a handful of strikebreakers from permanently quitting their jobs at the Westmoreland Coal Company in the town of Yukon, Pennsylvania. About four hours after the replacement workers had returned to their boarding house, 25 sheriff's deputies and Pennsylvania state policemen broke into and searched the boarding house. A crowd of striking miners gathered and ridiculed their failure to find the workers. The furious and embarrassed sheriff's deputies then fired into the crowd. Thirty people were injured and one man killed.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff withdrew the commissions of 18 deputies involved in the incident, but the Westmoreland Coal Company had them sworn in as local police deputies instead.[2]
Shortly after the Yukon incident, a small group of miners walking home from a meeting in Export passed coal company property. A squad of 20 sheriff's deputies and State Police troopers attacked them. Several miners were severely beaten, and one miner (trying to protect a child in his arms) was killed.[2]
In July 1910, striking miners secured a march permit from the town of South Greensburg. As the miners began their march, deputy sheriffs and Coal and Iron Police on horseback stopped them. Although the local chief of police stepped forward and told the deputies that the miners had permission to march, the deputies ignored him and continued to block the marchers. The miners attempted to walk away, but the deputies charged into them with their horses, swinging clubs. A riot ensued and the sheriff's deputies fired into the crowd—killing a miner. When the chief of police attempted to arrest the deputy responsible, the other deputies seized him and charged him with obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty. Outraged citizens of the town mobbed the sheriff's office and forced his release.[2]

Problems with the deputies were so severe that in November 1910 the Westmoreland County sheriff stopped securing them for the coal companies. The companies responded by seeking deputies from local police forces instead.[2]
In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing striking miners as deputy sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriff's deputies were cited for contempt of court for venturing too close to coal company property. The sheriff said that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined them anyway.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways.[17]
The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) proved to be the most violent group during the strike. The PSP had been founded in 1905 to discourage the use of private police forces in workers' strikes and to provide law enforcement when local police or sheriffs were unable or unwilling to enforce the law. But rather than enforce the law, the PSP proved the group most willing to break it. One trooper described how the State Police dealt with strikers: "We ride in, scoop them up and beat hell out of them."[4][18]
The number of unprovoked violent acts committed by the PSP was extremely high and frequent. James Maurer, a socialist member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly from Reading, conducted a survey asking for information on State Police actions during the strike. Maurer's survey found that violence significantly increased after the arrival of the State Police, and that almost all acts of violence were committed by state troopers without provocation. Mauer was so outraged by the results of his survey that he introduced a bill to abolish the state police.[2] Hundreds of citizens later testified before state and federal commissions that mounted State Police routinely charged onto town sidewalks or into crowds, trampling and severely injuring men, women and children (whether strikers or not). Severe beatings with fists and clubs were common, with troopers breaking into and ransacking homes without warrants, beating citizens and striking miners alike. Local police officials claimed State Police routinely beat people on the street for no reason, and resisted local police attempts to stop them. State Police troopers shot up towns "in true Western style", and fired indiscriminately into crowds or into tent cities (killing and wounding sleeping women and children). Sexual assault (including rape) was disturbingly common, and at least one hotel manager accused troopers of promoting prostitution.[4]
State Police were also involved in a number of serious violent incidents, several of which resulted in the deaths of unarmed strikers:

In May 1910, State Police allegedly killed a man in cold blood. Several State Police officers and a coal company executive stopped and questioned four striking miners who did not speak English. An English-speaking miner who spoke their language came on the scene and told the four men to run off. They did so and escaped, but the State Police troopers chased the fifth man into a barn. The miner was shot and killed. The numerous witnesses testified that the miner was begging for his life when a State Trooper shot him. But the other troopers and a coal company executive stated that the miner was killed in self-defense, and the trooper was exonerated.[2][10]
In May 1911, State Police assaulted a group of striking miners on a public road. The miners, on their way to a meeting, walked past property owned by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The road narrowed where a creek ran past the property. The mounted State Police troopers blocked the mines' path at this point, then charged into the crowd. Two miners were shot and several severely beaten. A Westmoreland County sheriff's deputy accompany the miners was also badly beaten.[2][11]
In June 1911, miners secured a permit to march past facilities owned by the Penn Gas Coal Company. As the marchers peacefully walked past the company's front gate, State Police opened fire. More than 150 shots were fired, causing panic and several injuries. Westmoreland County sheriff's deputies (all miners) identified three of the troopers and went to Penn Gas Coal Company to arrest them. Instead, Pennsylvania State Police and Coal and Iron Police arrested the deputies for violating the court injunction. A court sentenced the deputies to five days in jail. When the Westmoreland County sheriff refused to put his deputies in jail, the court ordered the sheriff's arrest and charged him with malfeasance. Despite the pleas of a jury, the court sentenced the sheriff to one year and three months in solitary confinement and hard labor.[2][10]

During the strike, six striking miners, nine wives of striking miners, and one bystander were killed, and thousands of strikers and members of their families severely beaten or wounded.[2][4]
End of the strike[edit]
By mid-1911, the strike had taken its toll on the coal companies. At least $500,000 had been spent on security, and coal production had dropped by 45 percent.[3] The larger companies, however, used their financial reserves and income from non-mining operations (such as rental properties, company stores and even breweries) to withstand the economic pressure exerted by the miners. But all companies benefited from a significant slump in the demand for coal in 1910 and 1911, which leveled the playing field vis-a-vis their competitors.[2]
But the miners were worse off than the employers. The winter of 1910–11 was particularly cold, and the miners and their families suffered tremendously. The union built numerous shacks and shanties, and moved miners' families out of tents and into the shacks for better protection from the elements. But not enough shelter could be erected, and 400 families spent the entire winter in tents. Hunger and disease were also beginning to become widespread among strikers' families.[2][3]
In early 1911, the UMWA's support for the strikers appeared strong. In January 1911, Lewis lost the presidency of UMWA to John P. White. White fully backed the strike, and the UMWA convention reaffirmed the union's support for the miners.[2]
But just six months later, the UMWA called a halt to the strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in strike relief funds, but it was no longer financially able to keep the strike going.[2] On July 1, 1911, the UMWA executive board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.[2][3]
Women's resistance[edit]
The Westmoreland County coal strike was the setting for one of the more colorful incidents in the life of Mary Harris Jones, better known as "Mother Jones". Even though she was 73 years of age, Mother Jones agreed to travel to Westmoreland County to support the United Mine Workers in their strike.
Singing women[edit]
A number of miners' wives had been arrested in the summer of 1910 for harassing strikebreakers and company security personnel.[2]
Jones encouraged the women to bring their babies and small children with them when they were sentenced by the court in Greensburg. The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there was no one else to care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers.
While the women were being processed for imprisonment, Jones instructed them: "You sing the whole night long. You can spell one another if you get tired and hoarse. Sleep all day and sing all night and don't stop for anyone. Say you're singing to the babies. I will bring the little ones milk and fruit. Just you all sing and sing."[19]
Unfortunately, the jail was next door to the sheriff's home, as well as several hotels, lodging houses, and other homes. The sound of women singing all through the night kept most of the townspeople awake. After five days of sleeplessness, the townspeople angrily demanded that the judge order the women's release. He did so.[19]
The incident has become known as "the women who sang their way out of jail."

The Westmoreland County coal strike of 1910–1911, or the Westmoreland coal miners' strike,[1] was a strike by coal miners represented by the United Mine Workers of America. The strike is also known as the Slovak Strike because about 70 percent of the miners were Slovak immigrants.[2] It began in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1910, and ended on July 1, 1911. At its height, the strike encompassed 65 mines and 15,000 coal miners.[2][3] Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.[4] The strike ended in defeat for the union.

Background[edit]
The Irwin gas coal basin is an area in Westmoreland and Venango Counties, Pennsylvania. It encompasses the townships of North Huntingdon, Penn, Sewickley, Salem, South Huntingdon, Hempfield and Irwin, and the boroughs of Murrysville, Export and Delmont. The coal mined in the district was unsuitable for use as coke. However, it was ideal for gasification and conversion into coal gas.[3]
Seven companies dominated coal mining in the Irwin Basin in 1910. In 1854, the Westmoreland Coal Company was formed to begin mining coal in the region. In 1905, it bought a controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal, a company established in 1861 to gasify coal. Penn Gas Coal, in turn, had obtained a one-third ownership in the Manor Gas Coal Company. Through these purchases, Westmoreland Coal had a near-monopoly on the gas coal market, and was the largest bituminous coal company in the Pennsylvania.[3][5] In 1892, Robert Jamison and his sons founded the Jamison Coal and Coke Company (originally the Jamison Coal Company).[6] In 1886, the Berwind family and Judge Allison White founded the Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.[7] In 1902, a number of smaller coal gas companies in and around Greensburg, Pennsylvania, merged to form the Keystone Coal and Coke Company. In 1905, Latrobe-Connellsville Coal and Coke Company was formed when Marcus W. Saxman merged three of his wholly owned or controlled coal companies.[8]
These companies were very paternalistic. Company towns (colloquially referred to as "coal patches") were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in company scrip.[3][9]
Origins of the strike[edit]
Coal miners increasingly agitated for improved wages and working conditions after 1900. Miners demanded an eight-hour day and wages equal to those paid in the nearby Pittsburgh coal basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought to be paid for mining "slack" (very fine coal), and for "dead work" (laying of track, shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay).[3]
Westmoreland Coal, Penn Gas Coal and Keystone Coal and Coke strongly resisted the miners' demands and any attempt at unionization. Companies used the Coal and Iron Police to physically intimidate and sometimes beat pro-union miners, workers were fired, and coal companies evicted families from the "coal patches" whenever miners struck.[3]
The situation came to a head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 cents per ton-and-a-half of coal mined. The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new safety lights and new forms of explosives—and pay for these items themselves.[2]
The strike[edit]
Miners' unions had tried to organize Westmoreland County coal mines since 1883, but had little success. In February 1910, however, the lower wage rates and new expenses led miners at Keystone Coal and Coke to meet and discuss their grievances among themselves. The miners decided to invite the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) to form a union.[2]
On March 7, 1910, Van Bittner, a UMWA vice president, arrived in Westmoreland County and formed a local union. Four hundred miners signed up and paid dues. Keystone Coke and Coal immediately fired 100 miners for attending the union organizing meeting. The Keystone miners walked off the job, and the strike swiftly spread throughout the Irwin Basin.[2]
Union recognition became the biggest issue in the strike. The workers felt that if they could win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.[2][10]
When the miners struck on March 9, the coal companies evicted thousands of families from their company-owned homes. UMWA spent $25,000 purchasing tents and constructing shanties, and set up 25 tent cities to accommodate the homeless. Near the town of Export, more than 100 tents went up, making it the largest tent city during the strike.[2][3]
Ethnic tension threatened to divide the nascent union. Slovakians comprised 70 percent of the striking miners, but the strike committee was led by native-born miners of English, German and Irish descent. UMWA organizers Bittner and Frank Hayes worked hard to overcome these divisions, however. Multi-lingual organizers were employed, each ethnic group elected its own representatives, and parades and rallies featured musicians and speakers from all groups.[2]
Public backing for the strike was high. Westmoreland County had a long history of support for unions. Local religious leaders signed petitions in favor of the union, testified before the United States Congress on behalf of workers, and called on the governor and state legislature to force the coal companies to submit to arbitration.[2]
UMWA support for the strike, however, was not nearly as strong. International union president Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to drum up increased support for the strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources.[2] Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers.[3] Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.[2]
Strikebreakers[edit]
To end the strike and break the union, the coal companies began importing thousands of Eastern European immigrants to work the mines. Coal company representatives on the East Coast promised immigrants a job and housing, and paid for them and their families to come to move to Pennsylvania. The flow of strikebreakers was small at first, but by the fall it was nearly a flood. The number of new immigrant workers was so large that the Penn Gas Coal company constructed 30 two-story houses in Hahntown to house its replacement workers, leading local residents to refer to the area as "Scab Hill."[3]
Management often took advantage of the strikebreakers, however. Company recruiters were ordered not to tell potential workers that they would be employed as strikebreakers. The coal companies sought out recent immigrants who did not speak English (or who spoke or understood it poorly), and then used this handicap against the strikebreakers. If workers tried to quit, the Coal and Iron Police prevented them from leaving and told them that they had to work off the cost of their transportation before resigning. When strikebreakers still tried to leave, the police beat them and forced them back to work. In some cases, fences were built around strikebreaker housing to intimidate the workers into staying. The abuse of strikebreakers was so severe that the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Labor held hearings on whether the coal companies had illegally forced people into peonage.[2][11][12][13]
Labor injunctions and other legal actions[edit]
Employers also turned to the courts for assistance. In April 1910, Keystone Coal and Coke sought a restraining order to prevent striking miners from approaching company property on the grounds that the number of strikers and the loud noises they made intimidated company employees. Although the local sheriff testified that the strikers had committed no acts of violence, the state district court issued a sweeping injunction which essentially barred the union from use of public roads:

Miners are restrained from conducting or engaging in marches to the mines, property and works of said Keystone Coal and Coke Company and from assembling at or near the works of said company for the purpose of holding meetings at such places at any time, and from assembling on the highways at such places where the employees of the said company ordinarily pass to and from their work, and from preventing said employees from going peaceably along said injunction: highways and also from attempting by noise, intimidation, threats, personal violence or by any other means to interfere with the employees of said company in their desire to labor or with any of the property of the said company until further order of this court.[14]

The vague terms of the injunction led law enforcement officials to arrest miners as much as a half mile from Keystone grounds. Other coal companies quickly asked for similar injunctions which "made marching, assembling or traversing public roads illegal."[10][15][16]
The coal companies moved aggressively to exploit the law in other ways as well. The Coal and Iron Police patrolled company property and denied admittance to union members and supporters. Union members were often arrested for using public roads which traversed company property.[17] Small towns and villages, often encircled by coal company land, became isolated and embattled. In Herminie, all citizens were required to obtain a pass from the local mine manager before leaving the village. Union members were denied the use of post offices or the ability to enter local courthouses, because these facilities were often on coal company property. Nearly 1,000 miners were ultimately arrested for trespass or disorderly conduct.[2][10] Simply walking home in a group from a union meeting on a public highway could earn a contempt citation and a $50 fine.[10][17]
In 1911, seven coal companies in Westmoreland County and Allegheny County sued the leaders of the strike. The coal companies claimed they had suffered economic losses as high as $500,000 due to the strike and strike-related property damage. Twenty-eight officers in nearby District 5 and 17 strike leaders in Westmoreland County were arrested on charges of conspiracy, intimidation, violence and general lawlessness. Local labor unions helped the 45 men post bond of $300 each, and instituted a special per capita assessment to form a legal defense fund. But the public outcry was so extraordinary that the coal companies dropped the suits.[2][10]
Use of security personnel[edit]
Employers also used force to intimidate striking miners. At their disposal were the Coal and Iron Police, local law enforcement personnel, and the Pennsylvania State Police.

The Coal and Iron Police primarily protected company property, protected strikebreakers, and kept strikebreakers from quitting.[3][10][13][17] But in many ways, their role in the strike was quite limited.
Sheriff's deputies and local police deputies proved to be a much bigger problem. The coal companies paid the Westmoreland County sheriff to provide deputies to protect their property and replacement workers (a common practice at the time). Although the sheriff's deputies would be acting under the color of law, they were paid for and under the control of the coal companies. The Westmoreland County sheriff obtained many deputies through "detective agencies" notorious of their strikebreaking activities, but nevertheless instructed the deputies to exercise restraint and ignore peaceful marches. He also warned them that he would dismiss deputies who committed acts of violence.[2]

Despite this, sheriff's deputies instigated and participated in three particularly violent and deadly incidents:

On May 8, 1910, sheriff's deputies attempted to prevent a handful of strikebreakers from permanently quitting their jobs at the Westmoreland Coal Company in the town of Yukon, Pennsylvania. About four hours after the replacement workers had returned to their boarding house, 25 sheriff's deputies and Pennsylvania state policemen broke into and searched the boarding house. A crowd of striking miners gathered and ridiculed their failure to find the workers. The furious and embarrassed sheriff's deputies then fired into the crowd. Thirty people were injured and one man killed.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff withdrew the commissions of 18 deputies involved in the incident, but the Westmoreland Coal Company had them sworn in as local police deputies instead.[2]
Shortly after the Yukon incident, a small group of miners walking home from a meeting in Export passed coal company property. A squad of 20 sheriff's deputies and State Police troopers attacked them. Several miners were severely beaten, and one miner (trying to protect a child in his arms) was killed.[2]
In July 1910, striking miners secured a march permit from the town of South Greensburg. As the miners began their march, deputy sheriffs and Coal and Iron Police on horseback stopped them. Although the local chief of police stepped forward and told the deputies that the miners had permission to march, the deputies ignored him and continued to block the marchers. The miners attempted to walk away, but the deputies charged into them with their horses, swinging clubs. A riot ensued and the sheriff's deputies fired into the crowd—killing a miner. When the chief of police attempted to arrest the deputy responsible, the other deputies seized him and charged him with obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty. Outraged citizens of the town mobbed the sheriff's office and forced his release.[2]

Problems with the deputies were so severe that in November 1910 the Westmoreland County sheriff stopped securing them for the coal companies. The companies responded by seeking deputies from local police forces instead.[2]
In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing striking miners as deputy sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriff's deputies were cited for contempt of court for venturing too close to coal company property. The sheriff said that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined them anyway.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways.[17]
The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) proved to be the most violent group during the strike. The PSP had been founded in 1905 to discourage the use of private police forces in workers' strikes and to provide law enforcement when local police or sheriffs were unable or unwilling to enforce the law. But rather than enforce the law, the PSP proved the group most willing to break it. One trooper described how the State Police dealt with strikers: "We ride in, scoop them up and beat hell out of them."[4][18]
The number of unprovoked violent acts committed by the PSP was extremely high and frequent. James Maurer, a socialist member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly from Reading, conducted a survey asking for information on State Police actions during the strike. Maurer's survey found that violence significantly increased after the arrival of the State Police, and that almost all acts of violence were committed by state troopers without provocation. Mauer was so outraged by the results of his survey that he introduced a bill to abolish the state police.[2] Hundreds of citizens later testified before state and federal commissions that mounted State Police routinely charged onto town sidewalks or into crowds, trampling and severely injuring men, women and children (whether strikers or not). Severe beatings with fists and clubs were common, with troopers breaking into and ransacking homes without warrants, beating citizens and striking miners alike. Local police officials claimed State Police routinely beat people on the street for no reason, and resisted local police attempts to stop them. State Police troopers shot up towns "in true Western style", and fired indiscriminately into crowds or into tent cities (killing and wounding sleeping women and children). Sexual assault (including rape) was disturbingly common, and at least one hotel manager accused troopers of promoting prostitution.[4]
State Police were also involved in a number of serious violent incidents, several of which resulted in the deaths of unarmed strikers:

In May 1910, State Police allegedly killed a man in cold blood. Several State Police officers and a coal company executive stopped and questioned four striking miners who did not speak English. An English-speaking miner who spoke their language came on the scene and told the four men to run off. They did so and escaped, but the State Police troopers chased the fifth man into a barn. The miner was shot and killed. The numerous witnesses testified that the miner was begging for his life when a State Trooper shot him. But the other troopers and a coal company executive stated that the miner was killed in self-defense, and the trooper was exonerated.[2][10]
In May 1911, State Police assaulted a group of striking miners on a public road. The miners, on their way to a meeting, walked past property owned by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The road narrowed where a creek ran past the property. The mounted State Police troopers blocked the mines' path at this point, then charged into the crowd. Two miners were shot and several severely beaten. A Westmoreland County sheriff's deputy accompany the miners was also badly beaten.[2][11]
In June 1911, miners secured a permit to march past facilities owned by the Penn Gas Coal Company. As the marchers peacefully walked past the company's front gate, State Police opened fire. More than 150 shots were fired, causing panic and several injuries. Westmoreland County sheriff's deputies (all miners) identified three of the troopers and went to Penn Gas Coal Company to arrest them. Instead, Pennsylvania State Police and Coal and Iron Police arrested the deputies for violating the court injunction. A court sentenced the deputies to five days in jail. When the Westmoreland County sheriff refused to put his deputies in jail, the court ordered the sheriff's arrest and charged him with malfeasance. Despite the pleas of a jury, the court sentenced the sheriff to one year and three months in solitary confinement and hard labor.[2][10]

During the strike, six striking miners, nine wives of striking miners, and one bystander were killed, and thousands of strikers and members of their families severely beaten or wounded.[2][4]
End of the strike[edit]
By mid-1911, the strike had taken its toll on the coal companies. At least $500,000 had been spent on security, and coal production had dropped by 45 percent.[3] The larger companies, however, used their financial reserves and income from non-mining operations (such as rental properties, company stores and even breweries) to withstand the economic pressure exerted by the miners. But all companies benefited from a significant slump in the demand for coal in 1910 and 1911, which leveled the playing field vis-a-vis their competitors.[2]
But the miners were worse off than the employers. The winter of 1910–11 was particularly cold, and the miners and their families suffered tremendously. The union built numerous shacks and shanties, and moved miners' families out of tents and into the shacks for better protection from the elements. But not enough shelter could be erected, and 400 families spent the entire winter in tents. Hunger and disease were also beginning to become widespread among strikers' families.[2][3]
In early 1911, the UMWA's support for the strikers appeared strong. In January 1911, Lewis lost the presidency of UMWA to John P. White. White fully backed the strike, and the UMWA convention reaffirmed the union's support for the miners.[2]
But just six months later, the UMWA called a halt to the strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in strike relief funds, but it was no longer financially able to keep the strike going.[2] On July 1, 1911, the UMWA executive board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.[2][3]
Women's resistance[edit]
The Westmoreland County coal strike was the setting for one of the more colorful incidents in the life of Mary Harris Jones, better known as "Mother Jones". Even though she was 73 years of age, Mother Jones agreed to travel to Westmoreland County to support the United Mine Workers in their strike.
Singing women[edit]
A number of miners' wives had been arrested in the summer of 1910 for harassing strikebreakers and company security personnel.[2]
Jones encouraged the women to bring their babies and small children with them when they were sentenced by the court in Greensburg. The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there was no one else to care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers.
While the women were being processed for imprisonment, Jones instructed them: "You sing the whole night long. You can spell one another if you get tired and hoarse. Sleep all day and sing all night and don't stop for anyone. Say you're singing to the babies. I will bring the little ones milk and fruit. Just you all sing and sing."[19]
Unfortunately, the jail was next door to the sheriff's home, as well as several hotels, lodging houses, and other homes. The sound of women singing all through the night kept most of the townspeople awake. After five days of sleeplessness, the townspeople angrily demanded that the judge order the women's release. He did so.[19]
The incident has become known as "the women who sang their way out of jail."

The Westmoreland County coal strike of 1910–1911, or the Westmoreland coal miners' strike,[1] was a strike by coal miners represented by the United Mine Workers of America. The strike is also known as the Slovak Strike because about 70 percent of the miners were Slovak immigrants.[2] It began in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1910, and ended on July 1, 1911. At its height, the strike encompassed 65 mines and 15,000 coal miners.[2][3] Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.[4] The strike ended in defeat for the union.

Background[edit]
The Irwin gas coal basin is an area in Westmoreland and Venango Counties, Pennsylvania. It encompasses the townships of North Huntingdon, Penn, Sewickley, Salem, South Huntingdon, Hempfield and Irwin, and the boroughs of Murrysville, Export and Delmont. The coal mined in the district was unsuitable for use as coke. However, it was ideal for gasification and conversion into coal gas.[3]
Seven companies dominated coal mining in the Irwin Basin in 1910. In 1854, the Westmoreland Coal Company was formed to begin mining coal in the region. In 1905, it bought a controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal, a company established in 1861 to gasify coal. Penn Gas Coal, in turn, had obtained a one-third ownership in the Manor Gas Coal Company. Through these purchases, Westmoreland Coal had a near-monopoly on the gas coal market, and was the largest bituminous coal company in the Pennsylvania.[3][5] In 1892, Robert Jamison and his sons founded the Jamison Coal and Coke Company (originally the Jamison Coal Company).[6] In 1886, the Berwind family and Judge Allison White founded the Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.[7] In 1902, a number of smaller coal gas companies in and around Greensburg, Pennsylvania, merged to form the Keystone Coal and Coke Company. In 1905, Latrobe-Connellsville Coal and Coke Company was formed when Marcus W. Saxman merged three of his wholly owned or controlled coal companies.[8]
These companies were very paternalistic. Company towns (colloquially referred to as "coal patches") were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in company scrip.[3][9]
Origins of the strike[edit]
Coal miners increasingly agitated for improved wages and working conditions after 1900. Miners demanded an eight-hour day and wages equal to those paid in the nearby Pittsburgh coal basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought to be paid for mining "slack" (very fine coal), and for "dead work" (laying of track, shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay).[3]
Westmoreland Coal, Penn Gas Coal and Keystone Coal and Coke strongly resisted the miners' demands and any attempt at unionization. Companies used the Coal and Iron Police to physically intimidate and sometimes beat pro-union miners, workers were fired, and coal companies evicted families from the "coal patches" whenever miners struck.[3]
The situation came to a head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 cents per ton-and-a-half of coal mined. The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new safety lights and new forms of explosives—and pay for these items themselves.[2]
The strike[edit]
Miners' unions had tried to organize Westmoreland County coal mines since 1883, but had little success. In February 1910, however, the lower wage rates and new expenses led miners at Keystone Coal and Coke to meet and discuss their grievances among themselves. The miners decided to invite the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) to form a union.[2]
On March 7, 1910, Van Bittner, a UMWA vice president, arrived in Westmoreland County and formed a local union. Four hundred miners signed up and paid dues. Keystone Coke and Coal immediately fired 100 miners for attending the union organizing meeting. The Keystone miners walked off the job, and the strike swiftly spread throughout the Irwin Basin.[2]
Union recognition became the biggest issue in the strike. The workers felt that if they could win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.[2][10]
When the miners struck on March 9, the coal companies evicted thousands of families from their company-owned homes. UMWA spent $25,000 purchasing tents and constructing shanties, and set up 25 tent cities to accommodate the homeless. Near the town of Export, more than 100 tents went up, making it the largest tent city during the strike.[2][3]
Ethnic tension threatened to divide the nascent union. Slovakians comprised 70 percent of the striking miners, but the strike committee was led by native-born miners of English, German and Irish descent. UMWA organizers Bittner and Frank Hayes worked hard to overcome these divisions, however. Multi-lingual organizers were employed, each ethnic group elected its own representatives, and parades and rallies featured musicians and speakers from all groups.[2]
Public backing for the strike was high. Westmoreland County had a long history of support for unions. Local religious leaders signed petitions in favor of the union, testified before the United States Congress on behalf of workers, and called on the governor and state legislature to force the coal companies to submit to arbitration.[2]
UMWA support for the strike, however, was not nearly as strong. International union president Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to drum up increased support for the strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources.[2] Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers.[3] Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.[2]
Strikebreakers[edit]
To end the strike and break the union, the coal companies began importing thousands of Eastern European immigrants to work the mines. Coal company representatives on the East Coast promised immigrants a job and housing, and paid for them and their families to come to move to Pennsylvania. The flow of strikebreakers was small at first, but by the fall it was nearly a flood. The number of new immigrant workers was so large that the Penn Gas Coal company constructed 30 two-story houses in Hahntown to house its replacement workers, leading local residents to refer to the area as "Scab Hill."[3]
Management often took advantage of the strikebreakers, however. Company recruiters were ordered not to tell potential workers that they would be employed as strikebreakers. The coal companies sought out recent immigrants who did not speak English (or who spoke or understood it poorly), and then used this handicap against the strikebreakers. If workers tried to quit, the Coal and Iron Police prevented them from leaving and told them that they had to work off the cost of their transportation before resigning. When strikebreakers still tried to leave, the police beat them and forced them back to work. In some cases, fences were built around strikebreaker housing to intimidate the workers into staying. The abuse of strikebreakers was so severe that the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Labor held hearings on whether the coal companies had illegally forced people into peonage.[2][11][12][13]
Labor injunctions and other legal actions[edit]
Employers also turned to the courts for assistance. In April 1910, Keystone Coal and Coke sought a restraining order to prevent striking miners from approaching company property on the grounds that the number of strikers and the loud noises they made intimidated company employees. Although the local sheriff testified that the strikers had committed no acts of violence, the state district court issued a sweeping injunction which essentially barred the union from use of public roads:

Miners are restrained from conducting or engaging in marches to the mines, property and works of said Keystone Coal and Coke Company and from assembling at or near the works of said company for the purpose of holding meetings at such places at any time, and from assembling on the highways at such places where the employees of the said company ordinarily pass to and from their work, and from preventing said employees from going peaceably along said injunction: highways and also from attempting by noise, intimidation, threats, personal violence or by any other means to interfere with the employees of said company in their desire to labor or with any of the property of the said company until further order of this court.[14]

The vague terms of the injunction led law enforcement officials to arrest miners as much as a half mile from Keystone grounds. Other coal companies quickly asked for similar injunctions which "made marching, assembling or traversing public roads illegal."[10][15][16]
The coal companies moved aggressively to exploit the law in other ways as well. The Coal and Iron Police patrolled company property and denied admittance to union members and supporters. Union members were often arrested for using public roads which traversed company property.[17] Small towns and villages, often encircled by coal company land, became isolated and embattled. In Herminie, all citizens were required to obtain a pass from the local mine manager before leaving the village. Union members were denied the use of post offices or the ability to enter local courthouses, because these facilities were often on coal company property. Nearly 1,000 miners were ultimately arrested for trespass or disorderly conduct.[2][10] Simply walking home in a group from a union meeting on a public highway could earn a contempt citation and a $50 fine.[10][17]
In 1911, seven coal companies in Westmoreland County and Allegheny County sued the leaders of the strike. The coal companies claimed they had suffered economic losses as high as $500,000 due to the strike and strike-related property damage. Twenty-eight officers in nearby District 5 and 17 strike leaders in Westmoreland County were arrested on charges of conspiracy, intimidation, violence and general lawlessness. Local labor unions helped the 45 men post bond of $300 each, and instituted a special per capita assessment to form a legal defense fund. But the public outcry was so extraordinary that the coal companies dropped the suits.[2][10]
Use of security personnel[edit]
Employers also used force to intimidate striking miners. At their disposal were the Coal and Iron Police, local law enforcement personnel, and the Pennsylvania State Police.

The Coal and Iron Police primarily protected company property, protected strikebreakers, and kept strikebreakers from quitting.[3][10][13][17] But in many ways, their role in the strike was quite limited.
Sheriff's deputies and local police deputies proved to be a much bigger problem. The coal companies paid the Westmoreland County sheriff to provide deputies to protect their property and replacement workers (a common practice at the time). Although the sheriff's deputies would be acting under the color of law, they were paid for and under the control of the coal companies. The Westmoreland County sheriff obtained many deputies through "detective agencies" notorious of their strikebreaking activities, but nevertheless instructed the deputies to exercise restraint and ignore peaceful marches. He also warned them that he would dismiss deputies who committed acts of violence.[2]

Despite this, sheriff's deputies instigated and participated in three particularly violent and deadly incidents:

On May 8, 1910, sheriff's deputies attempted to prevent a handful of strikebreakers from permanently quitting their jobs at the Westmoreland Coal Company in the town of Yukon, Pennsylvania. About four hours after the replacement workers had returned to their boarding house, 25 sheriff's deputies and Pennsylvania state policemen broke into and searched the boarding house. A crowd of striking miners gathered and ridiculed their failure to find the workers. The furious and embarrassed sheriff's deputies then fired into the crowd. Thirty people were injured and one man killed.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff withdrew the commissions of 18 deputies involved in the incident, but the Westmoreland Coal Company had them sworn in as local police deputies instead.[2]
Shortly after the Yukon incident, a small group of miners walking home from a meeting in Export passed coal company property. A squad of 20 sheriff's deputies and State Police troopers attacked them. Several miners were severely beaten, and one miner (trying to protect a child in his arms) was killed.[2]
In July 1910, striking miners secured a march permit from the town of South Greensburg. As the miners began their march, deputy sheriffs and Coal and Iron Police on horseback stopped them. Although the local chief of police stepped forward and told the deputies that the miners had permission to march, the deputies ignored him and continued to block the marchers. The miners attempted to walk away, but the deputies charged into them with their horses, swinging clubs. A riot ensued and the sheriff's deputies fired into the crowd—killing a miner. When the chief of police attempted to arrest the deputy responsible, the other deputies seized him and charged him with obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty. Outraged citizens of the town mobbed the sheriff's office and forced his release.[2]

Problems with the deputies were so severe that in November 1910 the Westmoreland County sheriff stopped securing them for the coal companies. The companies responded by seeking deputies from local police forces instead.[2]
In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing striking miners as deputy sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriff's deputies were cited for contempt of court for venturing too close to coal company property. The sheriff said that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined them anyway.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways.[17]
The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) proved to be the most violent group during the strike. The PSP had been founded in 1905 to discourage the use of private police forces in workers' strikes and to provide law enforcement when local police or sheriffs were unable or unwilling to enforce the law. But rather than enforce the law, the PSP proved the group most willing to break it. One trooper described how the State Police dealt with strikers: "We ride in, scoop them up and beat hell out of them."[4][18]
The number of unprovoked violent acts committed by the PSP was extremely high and frequent. James Maurer, a socialist member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly from Reading, conducted a survey asking for information on State Police actions during the strike. Maurer's survey found that violence significantly increased after the arrival of the State Police, and that almost all acts of violence were committed by state troopers without provocation. Mauer was so outraged by the results of his survey that he introduced a bill to abolish the state police.[2] Hundreds of citizens later testified before state and federal commissions that mounted State Police routinely charged onto town sidewalks or into crowds, trampling and severely injuring men, women and children (whether strikers or not). Severe beatings with fists and clubs were common, with troopers breaking into and ransacking homes without warrants, beating citizens and striking miners alike. Local police officials claimed State Police routinely beat people on the street for no reason, and resisted local police attempts to stop them. State Police troopers shot up towns "in true Western style", and fired indiscriminately into crowds or into tent cities (killing and wounding sleeping women and children). Sexual assault (including rape) was disturbingly common, and at least one hotel manager accused troopers of promoting prostitution.[4]
State Police were also involved in a number of serious violent incidents, several of which resulted in the deaths of unarmed strikers:

In May 1910, State Police allegedly killed a man in cold blood. Several State Police officers and a coal company executive stopped and questioned four striking miners who did not speak English. An English-speaking miner who spoke their language came on the scene and told the four men to run off. They did so and escaped, but the State Police troopers chased the fifth man into a barn. The miner was shot and killed. The numerous witnesses testified that the miner was begging for his life when a State Trooper shot him. But the other troopers and a coal company executive stated that the miner was killed in self-defense, and the trooper was exonerated.[2][10]
In May 1911, State Police assaulted a group of striking miners on a public road. The miners, on their way to a meeting, walked past property owned by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The road narrowed where a creek ran past the property. The mounted State Police troopers blocked the mines' path at this point, then charged into the crowd. Two miners were shot and several severely beaten. A Westmoreland County sheriff's deputy accompany the miners was also badly beaten.[2][11]
In June 1911, miners secured a permit to march past facilities owned by the Penn Gas Coal Company. As the marchers peacefully walked past the company's front gate, State Police opened fire. More than 150 shots were fired, causing panic and several injuries. Westmoreland County sheriff's deputies (all miners) identified three of the troopers and went to Penn Gas Coal Company to arrest them. Instead, Pennsylvania State Police and Coal and Iron Police arrested the deputies for violating the court injunction. A court sentenced the deputies to five days in jail. When the Westmoreland County sheriff refused to put his deputies in jail, the court ordered the sheriff's arrest and charged him with malfeasance. Despite the pleas of a jury, the court sentenced the sheriff to one year and three months in solitary confinement and hard labor.[2][10]

During the strike, six striking miners, nine wives of striking miners, and one bystander were killed, and thousands of strikers and members of their families severely beaten or wounded.[2][4]
End of the strike[edit]
By mid-1911, the strike had taken its toll on the coal companies. At least $500,000 had been spent on security, and coal production had dropped by 45 percent.[3] The larger companies, however, used their financial reserves and income from non-mining operations (such as rental properties, company stores and even breweries) to withstand the economic pressure exerted by the miners. But all companies benefited from a significant slump in the demand for coal in 1910 and 1911, which leveled the playing field vis-a-vis their competitors.[2]
But the miners were worse off than the employers. The winter of 1910–11 was particularly cold, and the miners and their families suffered tremendously. The union built numerous shacks and shanties, and moved miners' families out of tents and into the shacks for better protection from the elements. But not enough shelter could be erected, and 400 families spent the entire winter in tents. Hunger and disease were also beginning to become widespread among strikers' families.[2][3]
In early 1911, the UMWA's support for the strikers appeared strong. In January 1911, Lewis lost the presidency of UMWA to John P. White. White fully backed the strike, and the UMWA convention reaffirmed the union's support for the miners.[2]
But just six months later, the UMWA called a halt to the strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in strike relief funds, but it was no longer financially able to keep the strike going.[2] On July 1, 1911, the UMWA executive board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.[2][3]
Women's resistance[edit]
The Westmoreland County coal strike was the setting for one of the more colorful incidents in the life of Mary Harris Jones, better known as "Mother Jones". Even though she was 73 years of age, Mother Jones agreed to travel to Westmoreland County to support the United Mine Workers in their strike.
Singing women[edit]
A number of miners' wives had been arrested in the summer of 1910 for harassing strikebreakers and company security personnel.[2]
Jones encouraged the women to bring their babies and small children with them when they were sentenced by the court in Greensburg. The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there was no one else to care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers.
While the women were being processed for imprisonment, Jones instructed them: "You sing the whole night long. You can spell one another if you get tired and hoarse. Sleep all day and sing all night and don't stop for anyone. Say you're singing to the babies. I will bring the little ones milk and fruit. Just you all sing and sing."[19]
Unfortunately, the jail was next door to the sheriff's home, as well as several hotels, lodging houses, and other homes. The sound of women singing all through the night kept most of the townspeople awake. After five days of sleeplessness, the townspeople angrily demanded that the judge order the women's release. He did so.[19]
The incident has become known as "the women who sang their way out of jail."

The Westmoreland County coal strike of 1910–1911, or the Westmoreland coal miners' strike,[1] was a strike by coal miners represented by the United Mine Workers of America. The strike is also known as the Slovak Strike because about 70 percent of the miners were Slovak immigrants.[2] It began in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1910, and ended on July 1, 1911. At its height, the strike encompassed 65 mines and 15,000 coal miners.[2][3] Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.[4] The strike ended in defeat for the union.

Background[edit]
The Irwin gas coal basin is an area in Westmoreland and Venango Counties, Pennsylvania. It encompasses the townships of North Huntingdon, Penn, Sewickley, Salem, South Huntingdon, Hempfield and Irwin, and the boroughs of Murrysville, Export and Delmont. The coal mined in the district was unsuitable for use as coke. However, it was ideal for gasification and conversion into coal gas.[3]
Seven companies dominated coal mining in the Irwin Basin in 1910. In 1854, the Westmoreland Coal Company was formed to begin mining coal in the region. In 1905, it bought a controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal, a company established in 1861 to gasify coal. Penn Gas Coal, in turn, had obtained a one-third ownership in the Manor Gas Coal Company. Through these purchases, Westmoreland Coal had a near-monopoly on the gas coal market, and was the largest bituminous coal company in the Pennsylvania.[3][5] In 1892, Robert Jamison and his sons founded the Jamison Coal and Coke Company (originally the Jamison Coal Company).[6] In 1886, the Berwind family and Judge Allison White founded the Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.[7] In 1902, a number of smaller coal gas companies in and around Greensburg, Pennsylvania, merged to form the Keystone Coal and Coke Company. In 1905, Latrobe-Connellsville Coal and Coke Company was formed when Marcus W. Saxman merged three of his wholly owned or controlled coal companies.[8]
These companies were very paternalistic. Company towns (colloquially referred to as "coal patches") were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in company scrip.[3][9]
Origins of the strike[edit]
Coal miners increasingly agitated for improved wages and working conditions after 1900. Miners demanded an eight-hour day and wages equal to those paid in the nearby Pittsburgh coal basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought to be paid for mining "slack" (very fine coal), and for "dead work" (laying of track, shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay).[3]
Westmoreland Coal, Penn Gas Coal and Keystone Coal and Coke strongly resisted the miners' demands and any attempt at unionization. Companies used the Coal and Iron Police to physically intimidate and sometimes beat pro-union miners, workers were fired, and coal companies evicted families from the "coal patches" whenever miners struck.[3]
The situation came to a head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 cents per ton-and-a-half of coal mined. The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new safety lights and new forms of explosives—and pay for these items themselves.[2]
The strike[edit]
Miners' unions had tried to organize Westmoreland County coal mines since 1883, but had little success. In February 1910, however, the lower wage rates and new expenses led miners at Keystone Coal and Coke to meet and discuss their grievances among themselves. The miners decided to invite the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) to form a union.[2]
On March 7, 1910, Van Bittner, a UMWA vice president, arrived in Westmoreland County and formed a local union. Four hundred miners signed up and paid dues. Keystone Coke and Coal immediately fired 100 miners for attending the union organizing meeting. The Keystone miners walked off the job, and the strike swiftly spread throughout the Irwin Basin.[2]
Union recognition became the biggest issue in the strike. The workers felt that if they could win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.[2][10]
When the miners struck on March 9, the coal companies evicted thousands of families from their company-owned homes. UMWA spent $25,000 purchasing tents and constructing shanties, and set up 25 tent cities to accommodate the homeless. Near the town of Export, more than 100 tents went up, making it the largest tent city during the strike.[2][3]
Ethnic tension threatened to divide the nascent union. Slovakians comprised 70 percent of the striking miners, but the strike committee was led by native-born miners of English, German and Irish descent. UMWA organizers Bittner and Frank Hayes worked hard to overcome these divisions, however. Multi-lingual organizers were employed, each ethnic group elected its own representatives, and parades and rallies featured musicians and speakers from all groups.[2]
Public backing for the strike was high. Westmoreland County had a long history of support for unions. Local religious leaders signed petitions in favor of the union, testified before the United States Congress on behalf of workers, and called on the governor and state legislature to force the coal companies to submit to arbitration.[2]
UMWA support for the strike, however, was not nearly as strong. International union president Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to drum up increased support for the strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources.[2] Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers.[3] Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.[2]
Strikebreakers[edit]
To end the strike and break the union, the coal companies began importing thousands of Eastern European immigrants to work the mines. Coal company representatives on the East Coast promised immigrants a job and housing, and paid for them and their families to come to move to Pennsylvania. The flow of strikebreakers was small at first, but by the fall it was nearly a flood. The number of new immigrant workers was so large that the Penn Gas Coal company constructed 30 two-story houses in Hahntown to house its replacement workers, leading local residents to refer to the area as "Scab Hill."[3]
Management often took advantage of the strikebreakers, however. Company recruiters were ordered not to tell potential workers that they would be employed as strikebreakers. The coal companies sought out recent immigrants who did not speak English (or who spoke or understood it poorly), and then used this handicap against the strikebreakers. If workers tried to quit, the Coal and Iron Police prevented them from leaving and told them that they had to work off the cost of their transportation before resigning. When strikebreakers still tried to leave, the police beat them and forced them back to work. In some cases, fences were built around strikebreaker housing to intimidate the workers into staying. The abuse of strikebreakers was so severe that the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Labor held hearings on whether the coal companies had illegally forced people into peonage.[2][11][12][13]
Labor injunctions and other legal actions[edit]
Employers also turned to the courts for assistance. In April 1910, Keystone Coal and Coke sought a restraining order to prevent striking miners from approaching company property on the grounds that the number of strikers and the loud noises they made intimidated company employees. Although the local sheriff testified that the strikers had committed no acts of violence, the state district court issued a sweeping injunction which essentially barred the union from use of public roads:

Miners are restrained from conducting or engaging in marches to the mines, property and works of said Keystone Coal and Coke Company and from assembling at or near the works of said company for the purpose of holding meetings at such places at any time, and from assembling on the highways at such places where the employees of the said company ordinarily pass to and from their work, and from preventing said employees from going peaceably along said injunction: highways and also from attempting by noise, intimidation, threats, personal violence or by any other means to interfere with the employees of said company in their desire to labor or with any of the property of the said company until further order of this court.[14]

The vague terms of the injunction led law enforcement officials to arrest miners as much as a half mile from Keystone grounds. Other coal companies quickly asked for similar injunctions which "made marching, assembling or traversing public roads illegal."[10][15][16]
The coal companies moved aggressively to exploit the law in other ways as well. The Coal and Iron Police patrolled company property and denied admittance to union members and supporters. Union members were often arrested for using public roads which traversed company property.[17] Small towns and villages, often encircled by coal company land, became isolated and embattled. In Herminie, all citizens were required to obtain a pass from the local mine manager before leaving the village. Union members were denied the use of post offices or the ability to enter local courthouses, because these facilities were often on coal company property. Nearly 1,000 miners were ultimately arrested for trespass or disorderly conduct.[2][10] Simply walking home in a group from a union meeting on a public highway could earn a contempt citation and a $50 fine.[10][17]
In 1911, seven coal companies in Westmoreland County and Allegheny County sued the leaders of the strike. The coal companies claimed they had suffered economic losses as high as $500,000 due to the strike and strike-related property damage. Twenty-eight officers in nearby District 5 and 17 strike leaders in Westmoreland County were arrested on charges of conspiracy, intimidation, violence and general lawlessness. Local labor unions helped the 45 men post bond of $300 each, and instituted a special per capita assessment to form a legal defense fund. But the public outcry was so extraordinary that the coal companies dropped the suits.[2][10]
Use of security personnel[edit]
Employers also used force to intimidate striking miners. At their disposal were the Coal and Iron Police, local law enforcement personnel, and the Pennsylvania State Police.

The Coal and Iron Police primarily protected company property, protected strikebreakers, and kept strikebreakers from quitting.[3][10][13][17] But in many ways, their role in the strike was quite limited.
Sheriff's deputies and local police deputies proved to be a much bigger problem. The coal companies paid the Westmoreland County sheriff to provide deputies to protect their property and replacement workers (a common practice at the time). Although the sheriff's deputies would be acting under the color of law, they were paid for and under the control of the coal companies. The Westmoreland County sheriff obtained many deputies through "detective agencies" notorious of their strikebreaking activities, but nevertheless instructed the deputies to exercise restraint and ignore peaceful marches. He also warned them that he would dismiss deputies who committed acts of violence.[2]

Despite this, sheriff's deputies instigated and participated in three particularly violent and deadly incidents:

On May 8, 1910, sheriff's deputies attempted to prevent a handful of strikebreakers from permanently quitting their jobs at the Westmoreland Coal Company in the town of Yukon, Pennsylvania. About four hours after the replacement workers had returned to their boarding house, 25 sheriff's deputies and Pennsylvania state policemen broke into and searched the boarding house. A crowd of striking miners gathered and ridiculed their failure to find the workers. The furious and embarrassed sheriff's deputies then fired into the crowd. Thirty people were injured and one man killed.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff withdrew the commissions of 18 deputies involved in the incident, but the Westmoreland Coal Company had them sworn in as local police deputies instead.[2]
Shortly after the Yukon incident, a small group of miners walking home from a meeting in Export passed coal company property. A squad of 20 sheriff's deputies and State Police troopers attacked them. Several miners were severely beaten, and one miner (trying to protect a child in his arms) was killed.[2]
In July 1910, striking miners secured a march permit from the town of South Greensburg. As the miners began their march, deputy sheriffs and Coal and Iron Police on horseback stopped them. Although the local chief of police stepped forward and told the deputies that the miners had permission to march, the deputies ignored him and continued to block the marchers. The miners attempted to walk away, but the deputies charged into them with their horses, swinging clubs. A riot ensued and the sheriff's deputies fired into the crowd—killing a miner. When the chief of police attempted to arrest the deputy responsible, the other deputies seized him and charged him with obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty. Outraged citizens of the town mobbed the sheriff's office and forced his release.[2]

Problems with the deputies were so severe that in November 1910 the Westmoreland County sheriff stopped securing them for the coal companies. The companies responded by seeking deputies from local police forces instead.[2]
In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing striking miners as deputy sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriff's deputies were cited for contempt of court for venturing too close to coal company property. The sheriff said that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined them anyway.[2][10] The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways.[17]
The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) proved to be the most violent group during the strike. The PSP had been founded in 1905 to discourage the use of private police forces in workers' strikes and to provide law enforcement when local police or sheriffs were unable or unwilling to enforce the law. But rather than enforce the law, the PSP proved the group most willing to break it. One trooper described how the State Police dealt with strikers: "We ride in, scoop them up and beat hell out of them."[4][18]
The number of unprovoked violent acts committed by the PSP was extremely high and frequent. James Maurer, a socialist member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly from Reading, conducted a survey asking for information on State Police actions during the strike. Maurer's survey found that violence significantly increased after the arrival of the State Police, and that almost all acts of violence were committed by state troopers without provocation. Mauer was so outraged by the results of his survey that he introduced a bill to abolish the state police.[2] Hundreds of citizens later testified before state and federal commissions that mounted State Police routinely charged onto town sidewalks or into crowds, trampling and severely injuring men, women and children (whether strikers or not). Severe beatings with fists and clubs were common, with troopers breaking into and ransacking homes without warrants, beating citizens and striking miners alike. Local police officials claimed State Police routinely beat people on the street for no reason, and resisted local police attempts to stop them. State Police troopers shot up towns "in true Western style", and fired indiscriminately into crowds or into tent cities (killing and wounding sleeping women and children). Sexual assault (including rape) was disturbingly common, and at least one hotel manager accused troopers of promoting prostitution.[4]
State Police were also involved in a number of serious violent incidents, several of which resulted in the deaths of unarmed strikers:

In May 1910, State Police allegedly killed a man in cold blood. Several State Police officers and a coal company executive stopped and questioned four striking miners who did not speak English. An English-speaking miner who spoke their language came on the scene and told the four men to run off. They did so and escaped, but the State Police troopers chased the fifth man into a barn. The miner was shot and killed. The numerous witnesses testified that the miner was begging for his life when a State Trooper shot him. But the other troopers and a coal company executive stated that the miner was killed in self-defense, and the trooper was exonerated.[2][10]
In May 1911, State Police assaulted a group of striking miners on a public road. The miners, on their way to a meeting, walked past property owned by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The road narrowed where a creek ran past the property. The mounted State Police troopers blocked the mines' path at this point, then charged into the crowd. Two miners were shot and several severely beaten. A Westmoreland County sheriff's deputy accompany the miners was also badly beaten.[2][11]
In June 1911, miners secured a permit to march past facilities owned by the Penn Gas Coal Company. As the marchers peacefully walked past the company's front gate, State Police opened fire. More than 150 shots were fired, causing panic and several injuries. Westmoreland County sheriff's deputies (all miners) identified three of the troopers and went to Penn Gas Coal Company to arrest them. Instead, Pennsylvania State Police and Coal and Iron Police arrested the deputies for violating the court injunction. A court sentenced the deputies to five days in jail. When the Westmoreland County sheriff refused to put his deputies in jail, the court ordered the sheriff's arrest and charged him with malfeasance. Despite the pleas of a jury, the court sentenced the sheriff to one year and three months in solitary confinement and hard labor.[2][10]

During the strike, six striking miners, nine wives of striking miners, and one bystander were killed, and thousands of strikers and members of their families severely beaten or wounded.[2][4]
End of the strike[edit]
By mid-1911, the strike had taken its toll on the coal companies. At least $500,000 had been spent on security, and coal production had dropped by 45 percent.[3] The larger companies, however, used their financial reserves and income from non-mining operations (such as rental properties, company stores and even breweries) to withstand the economic pressure exerted by the miners. But all companies benefited from a significant slump in the demand for coal in 1910 and 1911, which leveled the playing field vis-a-vis their competitors.[2]
But the miners were worse off than the employers. The winter of 1910–11 was particularly cold, and the miners and their families suffered tremendously. The union built numerous shacks and shanties, and moved miners' families out of tents and into the shacks for better protection from the elements. But not enough shelter could be erected, and 400 families spent the entire winter in tents. Hunger and disease were also beginning to become widespread among strikers' families.[2][3]
In early 1911, the UMWA's support for the strikers appeared strong. In January 1911, Lewis lost the presidency of UMWA to John P. White. White fully backed the strike, and the UMWA convention reaffirmed the union's support for the miners.[2]
But just six months later, the UMWA called a halt to the strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in strike relief funds, but it was no longer financially able to keep the strike going.[2] On July 1, 1911, the UMWA executive board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.[2][3]
Women's resistance[edit]
The Westmoreland County coal strike was the setting for one of the more colorful incidents in the life of Mary Harris Jones, better known as "Mother Jones". Even though she was 73 years of age, Mother Jones agreed to travel to Westmoreland County to support the United Mine Workers in their strike.
Singing women[edit]
A number of miners' wives had been arrested in the summer of 1910 for harassing strikebreakers and company security personnel.[2]
Jones encouraged the women to bring their babies and small children with them when they were sentenced by the court in Greensburg. The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there was no one else to care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers.
While the women were being processed for imprisonment, Jones instructed them: "You sing the whole night long. You can spell one another if you get tired and hoarse. Sleep all day and sing all night and don't stop for anyone. Say you're singing to the babies. I will bring the little ones milk and fruit. Just you all sing and sing."[19]
Unfortunately, the jail was next door to the sheriff's home, as well as several hotels, lodging houses, and other homes. The sound of women singing all through the night kept most of the townspeople awake. After five days of sleeplessness, the townspeople angrily demanded that the judge order the women's release. He did so.[19]
The incident has become known as "the women who sang their way out of jail."

Like others in the coal industry, WLB's share price has been hit severely due to the downturn in energy prices and the threat from natural gas.

However, WLB possesses key advantages that puts it far ahead of other competitors and ensures that it remains profitable for years to come. Furthermore, the market has largely misinterpreted its true financial situation, leading to a very depressed share price. These competitive advantages and current market perception will allow the stock price to outperform peers and the overall market significantly in the years to come.
Long-Term Cost Protected Contracts
Substantially all of WLB's coal is sold under long-term, cost-protected contracts. This means coal sales prices will adjust according to the actual costs associated with mining, including fixed costs. The average remaining length on these contracts as of 2015 was an astounding 11 years, thus indicating that its clients are committed to being in the coal business for decades to come. Moreover, the cost-protection provisions in its supply contracts ensure that coal delivered is priced based on its production costs plus a premium.

Our long-term coal contracts are "cost protected" in that they typically contain either full pass-through of our costs or price escalation and adjustment provisions, pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised in line with broad economic indicators such as the consumer price index, ...
(Source: WLB 10-K)


This contract structure essentially guarantees profitability for WLB even as coal prices fall. It ensures that WLB will never have to sell coal at a price below its marginal cost of production and accounts fully for the increase in cost of production over time.
Furthermore, the long length of these contracts ensures stable sales volumes. Hence, these contracts reduce both price and volume risks substantially. Compared to other producers that sell under conventional contracts for which sales price adjusts according to the spot or forward price, WLB is largely insulated from the tumult in the coal spot market today as it has price and volume visibility for the next 11 years. This is a crucial factor that explains why it will likely survive the current downturn and prosper thereafter.
Overall, 90% of WLB's coal sales are long-term cost plus/cost indexed contracts, with 49% of these contracts including fixed-cost reimbursements if the customer elects to reduce tonnage delivered. This puts the company in a strong position regardless of how low coal prices stay low.
Below is a summary of its US Operations, with the specifics on contract terms for each mine.


Source: 10-K and Other Filings
As seen, all of Westmoreland's US operations have contracts on a "cost-plus" basis, thus ensuring a floor for coal prices. Moreover, some contracts even have provisions for a minimum return on capital, CapEx and Reclamation cost pass-through, which benefits WLB substantially.
However, profitability is affected by lower commodities prices as supply contracts have clauses that would adjust prices according to indices linked to items such as diesel and gasoline. Hence, while they are largely insulated from coal price declines, WLB's margins did decrease during this period due to the overall fall in commodities indices.

We tried to obtain filings with the Public Utilities Commissions of the different states that Westmoreland operates in to get a clearer look at the terms of its contracts. However, these dockets are filed confidentially and not made available to the public. We did manage to find an interesting case where the Public Regulatory Commission for the state of New Mexico accidentally released a contract between PNM utilities and Westmoreland Coal to a local newspaper, which caused a legal uproar subsequently.


Assuming this contract is representative of the structure of the typical contract Westmoreland enters into, we see clearly that the way that cost-indexing is achieved is through weighting several key costs of production and using them to form an index for quarterly price adjustments. This mechanism ensures prices escalate more than or equivalent to costs over time, as long as the composition of costs does not change drastically and management does not grow complacent in managing costs.
The flip side to Westmoreland's contracting strategy is that its upside is limited if and when coal prices recover as the contract prices largely do not adjust according to the spot market. Hence, WLB would benefit far less than other coal producers in a coal bull market. However, WLB has some exposure to the international market due to its acquisition of Canadian assets from Sherritt International (OTCPK:SHERF), which would become more profitable should coal prices surge.


Source: WLB 10-K, Sherritt International Annual Report, WLB Investor Presentation
A key rationale cited by management for purchasing the Canadian assets was the "long-term cost-protected" contracts that the mines have, which are almost a mirror to WLB's US operations. In addition, the Coal Valley mine offers potential upside when the coal industry recovers as its exports are priced on a spot/forward basis. The mine also has strategic access to ports and rail lines which reduce transport costs and the risk of disruption.
Mine-Mouth Operations
A large majority of WLB's mines are located in close proximity to the power plants that they supply, so close in fact, most of their coal is transported via conveyer belts directly into the coal-fired generators. Five out of six of WLB's mines in Canada are mine-mouth operations where mines are directly adjacent to the power plant, and almost all US mines are able to deliver coal via conveyer belts or trucks to the generators. This is an incredible advantage that substantially decreases transportation costs and gives the company a unique edge over regional competitors.
This also ensures supply is not exposed to the risk of rail disruption or poor weather, which tends to impact financial results significantly during harsh winter conditions.
Unaffected By Cheap Natural Gas
Over the past few years, cheaper natural gas and the retirement of older coal plants have resulted in natural gas comprising a larger percentage in the fuel mix for electricity generation. Concurrently, coal's share has declined.
However, due to the decade-long contracts that WLB has with its customers, along with the fact that the mine-mouth operations enable fast and cost-efficient transportation, WLB's business is unaffected as it has already locked in the coal demand for years to come. Moreover, a portion of Westmoreland's income is derived from leasing out coal properties and collecting royalties on their sales. These are also multi-year leases with profitable terms and will not be terminated anytime soon. Hence, there is little risk to this income stream.

Also, given that new gas power plants would require large capital investments amounting to a few hundred million or over a billion, and new infrastructure such as gas pipelines would need to be built, any shift away from coal to natural gas will take a very long time for WLB's clients.
Another point to note is that even at these natural gas prices, WLB is still delivering coal to its customers at far below the natural-gas equivalent. This is partially due to the cost advantage of having mine-mouth operations and the existing transportation infrastructure, as well as efficient operations.


Source: WLB Investor Presentation
Despite natural gas languishing at multi-year lows, WLB still delivers coal at a lower rate. This illustrates the sustainability of its business.
Disastrous Numbers Mask Stronger Fundamentals

Note: Revenues are aligned to the axis on the right.
As seen above, WLB's cash flows were healthy until they started declining drastically after 2013. At face value, net-income appears to have taken a massive dive as well. However, on closer inspection, we discovered several extraordinary, non-recurring items that have made results appear far worse than they actually are.
1) WLB recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $49.1M in 2014. It repurchased 10.75% Senior Notes and refinanced part of the debt at a lower rate by issuing 8.75% Senior Notes. Hence, managed to decrease its leverage albeit taking a large one-time charge. Although WLB paid a cash premium to redeem its debt, it serves the company better in the long-run to reduce leverage during tough industry environments. Moreover, the $49.1M was a non-cash charge, and did not affect operating cash flows.

2) The company recorded a derivative loss of $31.1M due to changes in its power-purchase contracts at the ROVA power plants. Essentially, WLB purchases power for the power plants it owns at a fixed price. As energy prices capitulated in 2014, the company had to mark-to-market the loss on the contract as GAAP classifies it as a financial instrument. Hence, WLB would record positive gains when energy prices rebound. In essence, although the charge appears large, it is relatively inconsequential to its operations.
3) WLB incurred $26.8M in acquisition and transition costs due to its purchase of Canadian coal mines and other assets, which it has since spun off into a separate MLP (NYSE:WMLP) in which it owns a 79% stake. These costs are not expected to persist, and were expected as part of the acquisition.
4) WLB incurred a $15M restructuring charge as it reorganized its Canadian assets after acquiring them in 2014. A portion of this cash was also used to restructure WMLP's debt. These are not expected to reoccur.
If we exclude these one-time items, results for 2014 appear significantly better: net income would improve from ($173M) to ($51M). OCF and FCF would also improve substantially from $50.4M to $92.1M, and from $0 to $47.1M respectively. With a current market capitalization of $221M, WLB would have generated a FCF yield of over 21% if we excluded one-time cash expenses. Given this ridiculously high free cash flow yield excluding one-time charges, WLB should be trading far higher than the currently P/S of 0.15.
Hence, we believe once the acquisition is fully integrated and the one-time charges cease, the market will discover WLB's true earnings power, leading to a substantial rally in share price.
Strong Business Model, But Problematic Balance Sheet
We have shown that WLB has a solid, sustainable business model that offers unique advantages compared to other regional competitors. However, its low valuation stems from certain concerns with the balance sheet, which we will now address.

From a glance at the balance sheet, the lay investor would conclude WLB has a serious debt and liabilities problem. We will show the next part of our research that the problem lies not in the size of the liabilities, but the misinterpretation that the size of long-term liabilities reflect the degree of negative impact to the company's financials. In reality, when we break down the cash-flow impact of these liabilities, they are clearly manageable.
WLB has a negative book value mainly due to its long-term debt, asset retirement obligations and pension liabilities. The market seems to have priced in a large probability of default risk due to these three items, but a more in-depth look would suggest that WLB is at little risk of default.
Breaking Down Large Liabilities
The sheer amount of liabilities on WLB's balance sheet is a major reason for its rock-bottom valuation: it trades at a P/S of 0.16, which is cheap even by coal industry standards. However, WLB has a negative book value, largely due to the $990M in long-term debt, $401M in asset retirement obligations and $293M in post-retirement benefits on its balance sheet. We shall split our analysis on these three items.
1) Long-Term Debt

Source: SEC Filings
Interest coverage ratios for the past few years paints a bleak picture. However, when analyzing the debt profile of WLB in this harsh environment, our key criteria is survivability. We note that EBITDA and EBIT interest coverage dropped dramatically in 2014 due to the one-time charges mentioned earlier. If we exclude these non-recurring items, EBITDA coverage would be at 1.52, clearly indicating that WLB is able to meet interest payments without further issuance of debt or equity.


Future interest expense are expected to stay fairly stable assuming WLB does not take on additional debt to fund purchases. The company's CEO has stated in previous conference calls that he intends to deleverage going forward, and to fund purchases through the drop-down from WMLP instead of having the parent company take on further debt. Hence, we can expect lower overall leverage going forward.
Overall, EBITDA is sufficient to fund long-term interest payments for the foreseeable future. Although the sheer size ($990M) of WLB's long-term debt seems risky, the reality is that interest expenses are fairly sustainable and does not put the company at a high risk of default.
2) Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO)
This liability stems from the need to reclaim the land that the coal mine sits on after mines are depleted. Again, whilst the $401M figure is huge, it does not accurately reflect the cash flows required to manage this liability.
For 2015, WLB will incur roughly $49M in ARO expenses. This can be fully covered by WLB's Reclamation Deposits, which have a balance of $76.9M, consisting of $43.7M in cash and equivalents and $33.2M in for-sale securities. In essence, the company has already partially funded these liabilities.
Furthermore, of the $404M in ARO, third-parties are responsible for roughly $99M of the reclamation liabilities, thus significantly reducing WLB's long-term ARO liabilities.
Adding those figures together, the total ARO attributable to WLB after deducting for reclamation deposits adds up to $227M, which will be slowly realized over a long period of time. Thus, when we translate the impact to annual cash flow, the amount is relatively small - in 2014, WLB only incurred $7.6M in ARO cash expenses.

3) Post-Retirement Medical Benefits
This liability is an actuarial estimate of the total sum that WLB would have to pay for post-retirement medical benefits for all its retired and current workforce. Again, like many other liabilities on WLB's balance sheet, the impact to cash flow is not as significant as suggested by the size of the liability.

Source: WLB 10-K
Seen above, the estimated cash flow figures are manageable given that WLB continues to churn out stable operating cash flow - on a trailing 12-month basis, WLB had cash from operations of $51.2M, which already includes interest expenses, ARO payables and pension and medical benefits.
Therefore, whilst the size of the liabilities appear large, the impact on WLB's future cash flows are relatively small, assuming operating cash flows do not decline drastically (again, very low probability of this scenario due to long-term cost protected contracts).
Environmental Compliance
A common threat to coal producers is the gradual shift by utilities away from coal-generated power plants due to the high cost of compliance to environmental statutes.
In this aspect, WLB has another advantage over most coal producers: substantially all of its clients are compliant with Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). That means they are at no imminent threat of being shut down or forced to switch to natural gas and other cleaner fuels.
Moreover, in past conference calls, management has stated explicitly that none of its customers have taken any action or expressed any intention to shut down plants that it is currently supplying due to environmental legislation or otherwise.
Its recent acquisition of Canadian properties has also aided in diversifying this risk, as Canadian laws could be considered more coal-friendly compared to the far more vindictive EPA.

Thus, while the risk from coal-to-gas conversion and plant retirements due to environmental pressures are still present, they are relatively contained in the case of WLB's customers compared to other coal producers.
WMLP Operations
WMLP is a Master Limited Partnership that has a portfolio of coal assets. WLB owns the general partner and has a controlling stake (79%) in WMLP.
WMLP was originally Oxford Resource Partners L.P, but was renamed after being acquired by WLB in a transaction that closed at the end of FY2014. Since then, there has been substantial restructuring of assets and liabilities to maximize the benefit to both WLB and WMLP.
Currently, WMLP operates as a standalone, publicly-traded MLP. However, the strategy that WLB has implemented is one that involves "dropping down" assets to WMLP, which would enable it to increase income and cash flow distributions.
Essentially, management's strategy has been to transfer coal mines and other assets to WMLP in exchange for cash or equity. WMLP would then operate the mines and generate income, thus resulting in higher income for both entities. However, unlike WLB's US and Canadian assets, WMLP's assets are not mine-mouth operations, i.e. the coal has to be transported a far longer distance, which means it does enjoy the same cost and time advantages like WLB's coal mines. As such, it operates in a more competitive market and is vulnerable to more risks.
We view WMLP's operations as a positive as WLB is able to monetize its assets indirectly through this "drop-down" method. It is able to exchange coal assets for either cash or equity in WMLP. This provides short-term liquidity (WLB can sell equity in WMLP if needed) whilst at the same time ensuring higher future income.
Conclusion
Essentially, WLB is a coal miner that operates like a monopoly in its niche markets. Due to permanent advantages like the close proximity of all its mines to the power station and the long-term cost protected contracts that are literally a decade long, it is virtually under no threat from other coal miners or from displacement due to cheap natural gas.

Unlike other coal miners whose sales contracts depend on price adjustments according to the current spot price or other indices, WLB has price and volume visibility for the next 11 years due to the nature of its long-term contracts, thus ensuring it is able to remain profitably in business in tough times.
Moreover, the depressed financial figures for FY2014 due to numerous one-time charges related to acquisition, restructuring and debt extinguishment costs has led investors to overlook the strong fundamentals of the company's business model and its financial sustainability. Certain large liabilities recorded on the balance sheet that have a far smaller impact on cash flow has compounded this problem. Add to that the general pessimism regarding the coal sector and we can safely say that Westmoreland Coal is a diamond in the rough.
