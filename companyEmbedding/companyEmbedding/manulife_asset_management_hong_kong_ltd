Please note that the price of units or shares and the income from them can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. The value of your investment and any income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount you have invested. Exchange rate fluctuations may affect the value of an investment and any income derived from it. If you exercise any right to cancel, you may not get back the amount initially invested if the unit or share price has fallen since you invested.Deductions for charges and expenses, particularly the initial charge, are not made uniformly throughout the life of the investment, so if you redeem out of the investment during the early years, you may not get back the amount invested. There can be no guarantee that the tax position or proposed tax position prevailing at the time of an investment will not change. Dividends and capital gains on securities issued in the relevant funds may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the countries in which each particular fund invests. The investment decision is yours but you should not invest unless the intermediary who offers you the funds or strategies has advised you that the funds or strategies are suitable for you and has explained why, including how the investment will be consistent with your investment objectives.     You must read the relevant Hong Kong offering document of a fund or strategy for all the relevant risk factors pertaining to that investment.

Asia

Asia ex Japan Equity
We believe that each individual Asian equity market is unique and hence offers opportunities to invest in companies that are overlooked or mispriced. Long term outperformance can be achieved by bottom up selection of undervalued, growth companies that have the pricing power or cost advantage that enable them to compete regionally and globally. The team believes that its extensive on-the-ground research gives it a deep local market insight which enables the timely identification of investment ideas.


Asia Small Cap
We believe that the Asian small cap universe is under-researched by the broker community and is largely inefficient. They believe that long term outperformance can be achieved by investing early in companies whose growth profile has been under-appreciated and hence incorrectly priced. In particular, the team looks to invest in companies that can achieve a re-rating and increase in market capitalization on the basis of market leadership, a superior growth profile and low valuation.


China A Shares
We believe that the mainland Chinese market is largely inefficient and that long term outperformance comes from the bottom-up selection of companies with excellent growth characteristics that are benefiting from strong long term investment trends.


Greater China
We believe that Greater China's markets are largely inefficient and with further economic convergence in the Greater China region, rigorous bottom-up stock picking can unearth companies with excellent growth characteristics that benefit from the strong long term investment trends in the region.



Global or International

European Core
The European Equity team believes that equity markets are inefficient over the short to medium term. Over the long term, outperformance can be generated by utilizing a stock selection process which is informed by rigorous bottom-up research.  Read more


Global Large Cap Growth
We believe that long-term outperformance comes from bottom-up selection of companies with excellent growth characteristics that are benefiting from strong long-term investment trends and from top-down sector allocation determined by economic and market trends.  Read more

For Immediate Release / Hong Kong / March 16, 2017Manulife Becomes the First Financial Institution to Receive Investment Company WFOE LicenseHONG KONG - Manulife today announces that it has been granted an Investment Company Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (WFOE) license. The new company, known as Manulife Investment (Shanghai) Limited Company, is the first financial institution to receive the Investment Company WFOE license.  This approval paves the way for Manulife to provide its global public market and private assets solutions in the fast-growing asset management industry in China.
Stringent requirements must be met in order to qualify for an Investment Company WFOE license compared to other WFOE categories. For example, the financial institution must own a majority stake in an existing entity in China. Manulife met this requirement through its 51% investment in the joint venture company, Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd, based in Shanghai.
Kai Sotorp, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Wealth and Asset Management for Manulife, said: “Being the first financial institution to receive the Investment Company WFOE status puts us in an excellent position to expand our range of global product offerings to investors in China.”
According to Donald Guloien, President and Chief Executive Officer of Manulife, “This underlines Manulife’s commitment to China and to the city of Shanghai by supporting its vision as a regional financial center. This also allows us to better fulfill our aspiration in serving Chinese investors to achieve their respective investment objectives.”
The Investment Company WFOE license will pave the way for Manulife to serve a broader investor base such as small and medium-sized institutions, private banks and independent wealth management platforms.  Potential solution offerings can range from traditional equities and fixed income products to private assets strategies, such as timberland, farmland, commercial real estate, etc.
Manulife’s investments in China include Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd with US$3.2 billion of assets under management (AUM)1, and Manulife TEDA Fund Management Company Ltd. with an AUM of US$9.8 billion2.
Roy Gori, President and CEO of Manulife Financial Asia, added: “This license will complement our joint ventures in serving investors in China, including Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance and Manulife TEDA Fund Management. Manulife-Sinochem was the first foreign invested joint-venture life insurer to sell mutual funds in China, while Manulife TEDA provides traditional retail and institutional asset management service and solutions for clients across the Chinese market.”
Manulife Investment (Shanghai) Limited Company will be the latest extension of Manulife Asset Management’s operations in Asia, which boasts a team of over 180 investment professionals3 in 10 markets in the region, and offers objective-oriented solutions across public and private markets with a multi-channel distribution approach.



1 AUM in USD as of 28 February 2017, rounded to the nearest billion. Manulife Asset Management’s assets under management include assets of Manulife TEDA Fund Management Company Ltd.'s 49% joint venture ownership structure. The methodologies used to compile the total assets under management are subject to change.


2 AUM in USD as of 28 February 2017, rounded to the nearest billion.


3 The total is comprised of investment professionals of Manulife Asset Management (Asia) and of Manulife TEDA.

Important Notes:

Manulife Global Fund



			Manulife Global Fund is an umbrella fund comprising a number of sub-funds investing in equity and/or fixed income securities, each of which has a different investment objective and risk profile.



			Certain sub-funds invest in emerging economies or markets, where special risks, including liquidity, volatility, government policies, taxation, currency, currency repatriation, political and regulatory risks, may be substantially higher than the risks normally associated with more developed economies or markets.



			Certain sub-funds invest in securities of small and medium sized companies in the relevant markets. This can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investments in larger and more established companies.



			Certain sub-funds concentrate their investments in a single country and/or a particular industry sector are subject to greater risks than diversified investments in several countries and/or regions and across sectors.



			The Inc share classes of the sub-funds do not guarantee distribution of dividends, the frequency of  distribution, and the amount/rate of dividends. Dividends may be paid out of income, realized capital gains and/or out of capital of certain sub-funds in respect of Inc share classes. Dividends paid out of capital of these sub-funds amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of the amount of an investor’s original investment or from any capital gains attributable to that original investment, and may result in an immediate decrease in the net asset value per share in respect of such classes of the sub-funds.



			Investment involves risk. The sub-funds may expose their investors to capital loss. Investors should not invest solely based on this material and should read the offering document for details including the risk factors, charges and features of the sub-funds and their share classes.



	 

Manulife Advanced Fund SPC


		Manulife Advanced Fund SPC is an umbrella fund comprising a number of sub-funds investing primarily in equity and bond securities, each of which has a different investment objective and risk profile.

		Certain sub-funds with significant exposure to Renminbi (“RMB”) bonds / equity / assets or emerging markets, may involve debt instrument, credit / counterparty, concentration, liquidity, volatility, currency, tax, economic, foreign exchange / multi-currency conversion, down-grading, regulatory and political risks and these risks could be substantially higher than the risks normally associated with the world’s more established markets.

		The sub-funds do not guarantee distribution of dividends, the frequency of distribution, and the amount/rate of dividends. A sub-fund may at its discretion pay dividend out of capital or gross income while charging / paying all or part of its fees and expenses out of its capital. This amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of an investor’s original investment or from any capital gains attributable to that original investment, and may result in an immediate reduction of the net asset value per share of the respective share classes after the distribution date.

		A bond sub-fund may hold a significant portion of assets in deposits if there are not sufficient RMB instruments for it to invest in. This may adversely affect its return and performance.

		Certain sub-funds using QFII quota to invest directly in debt instruments / shares are subject to various requirements and restrictions under the laws of Mainland China related to QFII investment and custodial risks.

		RMB is not freely convertible and is subject to exchange controls and restrictions.

		Investment involves risk. The sub-funds may expose to a high risk of capital loss. Investors should not invest solely based on this material and should read the offering document for details including the risk factors, charges and features of the sub-funds.


	 

Manulife Hong Kong Series


		Manulife Hong Kong Series (“the Series”) is an open-ended unit trust comprising a number of funds primarily investing in equities, debt securities, exchange-traded funds and/or collective investment schemes, each of which has a different investment objective and risk level.

		Certain funds may involve market, liquidity, credit, credit ratings, below investment grade and unrated securities, credit rating downgrading, interest rates, valuation, sovereign debt, unlisted debt securities, currency, foreign exchange, hedging, and distribution risks.

		Certain funds may involve market, liquidity, credit, credit ratings, below investment grade and unrated securities, credit rating downgrading, interest rates, valuation, sovereign debt, unlisted debt securities, currency, foreign exchange, hedging, and distribution risks.

		The funds do not guarantee distribution of dividends, the frequency of distribution, and the amount/rate of dividends. Dividends may be paid out of capital and/or out of gross income of certain funds in respect of Inc classes, while charging/paying all or part of certain funds’ fees and expenses to/out of capital of certain funds. This represents a return or a withdrawal of part of an investor's original investment amount or capital gain attributable to that amount. Distributions will result in an immediate decrease in the net asset value of the relevant units. Class AA (RMB) Inc Hedged Unit of certain funds is subject to higher distribution risks than other non-hedged unit classes.

		As RMB is not freely convertible, currency conversion is subject to exchange controls and restrictions. There can be no assurance that RMB will not be subject to devaluation. Insufficient amount of RMB for currency conversion or devaluation of RMB could adversely affect the value of investors’ investments in the RMB denominated class(es) of certain funds. The “Dim Sum” bond market is still a relatively small market which is more susceptible to volatility and illiquidity. Due to RMB concentration risk, the value of the funds may be more volatile than that of a fund having a more diverse portfolio of investments.

		Investment involves risk. The funds may expose its investors to capital loss. Investors should not make investment decisions based on this material alone but should read the offering document for details, including the risk factors, charges and features of the Fund and its unit classes.

Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
