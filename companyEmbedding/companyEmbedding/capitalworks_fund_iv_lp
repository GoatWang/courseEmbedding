(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements including our intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, strategies and predictions of our future activities, or other future events or conditions. These statements are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by these acts. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including, for example, the factors identified in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.  Liquidity  The Fund's primary source of funds was the proceeds of its Public Offering. Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions unpaid for the nine months ended December 31, 2014 or on working capital reserves, (ii) cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund has invested and (iii) proceeds received from the dispositions of the Operating Partnership that are returned to fund reserves. These sources of liquidity, along with the Fund's working capital reserve, are available to meet the obligations of the Partnership. The Fund does not anticipate significant cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships.  The Fund is currently accruing the fund management fee. Fund management fees accrued during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 were $1,201,787 and total fund management fees accrued as of December 31, 2014 were $49,686,873. During the nine months ended December 31, 2014, $2,644,058 of the accrued fund management fees were paid. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, these liabilities will be deferred until the Fund receives proceeds from sales of the Operating Partnerships that will be used to satisfy these liabilities. The Fund's working capital and sources of liquidity coupled with affiliated party liability accruals allow sufficient levels of liquidity to meet the third party obligations of the Fund. The Fund is currently unaware of any trends that would create insufficient liquidity to meet future third party obligations of the Fund.  Liquidity (continued)  As of December 31, 2014, an affiliate of the general partner of the Fund advanced a total of $1,466,176 to the Fund to pay some operating expenses of the Fund, and to make advances and/or loans to Operating Partnerships. These advances are included in Accounts payable affiliates. During the nine months ended December 31, 2014, $94,990 was advanced to the Fund from an affiliate of the general partner. The advances made in the nine months ended, as well as the total advances made as of December 31, 2014, are as follows:   Current Period Total Series 33 $ - 54,660 Series 34 - 133,578 Series 39 - 220,455 Series 40 8,941 368,570 Series 41 - 359,757 Series 42 - 221,615 Series 44 74,239 86,734 Series 45 11,810 20,807  All payables to affiliates will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow or the proceeds of sales or refinancing of the Fund's interests in Operating Partnerships.

In each instance the apartment complex owned by the applicable Operating Partnership is eligible for the federal housing tax credit. Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a certain percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as "Qualified Occupancy." Each of the Operating Partnerships and each of the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus or applicable report on Form 8-K. The general partner of the Fund believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties.  The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of various asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships. . . .

        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
