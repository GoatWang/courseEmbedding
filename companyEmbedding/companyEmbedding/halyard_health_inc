History[edit]
On March 26, 1872, Kimberly, Clark & Co. was established in Neenah, Wisconsin through the partnership of four businessmen—John A. Kimberly, Havilah Babcock, Charles B. Clark and Frank C. Shattuck.[5]
The first healthcare product by Kimberly-Clark was absorbent wadding, intended to replace cotton. It was used as a bandage for wounded soldiers in World War I. Army nurses adapted the material for menstrual use.[6] Kaycel fabric for surgical gowns was developed by Kimberly-Clark in 1960 for use in field hospitals during the Korean War.[7]
In 1980, Health Care began to grow as it was separated from consumer packaged goods management and products, such as Kleenex, with a move to Roswell, Georgia.[8] Kimberly-Clark Health Care had offices in North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Europe, Asia and India. It also sold its products in more than 150 countries.[9]
Expansion[edit]
Kimberly-Clark Health Care opened European Health Care operations in Brussels in 1991.[10]
In 1999, Kimberly-Clark Health Care expanded into new global markets.[11]
Company acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, Ballard Medical Product, a maker of disposable medical devices for respiratory care, gastroenterology and cardiology, was purchased by Kimberly-Clark for $764 million.[12]
That same year, Kimberly-Clark also acquired TECNOL Medical Products, Inc., a maker of disposable face masks and patient care products.[13]
Kimberly-Clark acquired Safeskin Corporation in 2000, a maker of disposable gloves for healthcare, high technology and scientific industries.[14]
In 2009, Kimberly-Clark acquired Baylis Medial Company’s Pain Management Business and I-Flow Corporation.[15][16]
On April 11, 2016, Halyard announced its agreement to acquire CORPAK MedSystems, a company specializing in enteral access devices. The acquisition is an all-cash transaction for a total consideration of $174 million.[17]
Spin-off[edit]
In November 2013, Kimberly-Clark Corporation announced the company’s plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of the company’s health care business creating a stand-alone, publicly traded health care company. Robert E. Abernathy, would become chief executive officer of the new company.[18]
In May 2014, Kimberly-Clark announced that the Form 10 for the spin-off plan had been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and that the new company, Halyard Health, would be headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia.[19]
The spin-off was scheduled to come into effect on October 31, 2014. At that time Halyard Health applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HYH." One hundred percent of the shares of Halyard Health would be distributed to Kimberly-Clark shareholders, one share for every eight shares of Kimberly-Clark stock.[19]
On November 3, 2014, Halyard debuted as a public company following the spin-off, and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol "HYH."
Products[edit]
Halyard Health focuses on seven categories of products.
Surgical Solution products are used in operating rooms and include gowns,[20] trays, drapes, masks, microbial sealant and sterilization wrap.
Digestive Health products are designed for enteral feeding, diagnostics and endoscopy procedures and include feeding tubes, gastric lavage systems, paracentesis needles and trays, endoscopy catheters, cleaning devices and cytology brushes.
Respiratory Health products are designed for airway management and include closed suction catheters,[21] oral care kits,[22] endotracheal tubes and sampling catheters.
Pain Management products include tools to manage chronic and surgical pain such as needles, trays, radiofrequency generators, cooled RF treatment systems, incisional pumps, ambulatory pumps and peripheral nerve block pumps.
Infection Prevention products include equipment designed to protect against contamination and infections such as gloves, gowns, masks,[23] apparel, chemotherapy protective equipment and hand hygiene monitoring.
IV Therapy products include pumps designed for in-home delivery of IV drugs.
Wound Care products include dressings designed to improve healing and maintain moisture.
Lawsuit[edit]
The infection protection Microcool gowns manufactured by Halyard are at the center of a fraud lawsuit against Halyard Health and Kimberly-Clark and profiled on the newsmagazine 60 Minutes.[24] The lawsuit alleges that Halyard knowingly sold Microcool gowns which failed to meet industry standard specifications and could potentially expose medical workers to the patient's bodily fluids. The company denies the allegations and asserts that the gowns which failed to meet specifications were outliers, and that no health care worker has been infected as a result of defective products.[25]
Headquarters/campus[edit]
Halyard Health's campus is located in Alpharetta, Georgia, just north of Atlanta.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Halyard Health are: Joe Woody, Robert E. Abernathy, Gary D. Blackford, John P. Byrnes, Ronald W. Dollens, Heidi K. Fields, Patrick J. O’Leary, Maria Sainz, and Dr. Julie Shimer.[26]
Awards[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, Halyard Health was named a winner of the Practice Greenhealth Champion for Change Awards, recognizing the company's ongoing commitment to sustainability accomplishments in support of people, the planet and products.[27][28]
Halyard Health was awarded Innovative Technology Designation for Coolief Cooled Radiofrequency Treatment at Novation Expo 2015.[29]
Community[edit]
Since Kimberly-Clark's original grant to help launch MedShare in 1998, the company has funded the shipment of $18.5 million worth of supplies to 13 countries in Latin America.[30]
Since then, Halyard examination gloves have been on every MedShare shipment and Halyard Health continues to be one of MedShare’s largest medical product donors. In 2015 Halyard donated $400,000 in medical supplies to MedShare for April 2015 Nepal earthquake relief efforts including surgical gowns, protective masks, and examination gloves.[31]

History[edit]
On March 26, 1872, Kimberly, Clark & Co. was established in Neenah, Wisconsin through the partnership of four businessmen—John A. Kimberly, Havilah Babcock, Charles B. Clark and Frank C. Shattuck.[5]
The first healthcare product by Kimberly-Clark was absorbent wadding, intended to replace cotton. It was used as a bandage for wounded soldiers in World War I. Army nurses adapted the material for menstrual use.[6] Kaycel fabric for surgical gowns was developed by Kimberly-Clark in 1960 for use in field hospitals during the Korean War.[7]
In 1980, Health Care began to grow as it was separated from consumer packaged goods management and products, such as Kleenex, with a move to Roswell, Georgia.[8] Kimberly-Clark Health Care had offices in North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Europe, Asia and India. It also sold its products in more than 150 countries.[9]
Expansion[edit]
Kimberly-Clark Health Care opened European Health Care operations in Brussels in 1991.[10]
In 1999, Kimberly-Clark Health Care expanded into new global markets.[11]
Company acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, Ballard Medical Product, a maker of disposable medical devices for respiratory care, gastroenterology and cardiology, was purchased by Kimberly-Clark for $764 million.[12]
That same year, Kimberly-Clark also acquired TECNOL Medical Products, Inc., a maker of disposable face masks and patient care products.[13]
Kimberly-Clark acquired Safeskin Corporation in 2000, a maker of disposable gloves for healthcare, high technology and scientific industries.[14]
In 2009, Kimberly-Clark acquired Baylis Medial Company’s Pain Management Business and I-Flow Corporation.[15][16]
On April 11, 2016, Halyard announced its agreement to acquire CORPAK MedSystems, a company specializing in enteral access devices. The acquisition is an all-cash transaction for a total consideration of $174 million.[17]
Spin-off[edit]
In November 2013, Kimberly-Clark Corporation announced the company’s plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of the company’s health care business creating a stand-alone, publicly traded health care company. Robert E. Abernathy, would become chief executive officer of the new company.[18]
In May 2014, Kimberly-Clark announced that the Form 10 for the spin-off plan had been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and that the new company, Halyard Health, would be headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia.[19]
The spin-off was scheduled to come into effect on October 31, 2014. At that time Halyard Health applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HYH." One hundred percent of the shares of Halyard Health would be distributed to Kimberly-Clark shareholders, one share for every eight shares of Kimberly-Clark stock.[19]
On November 3, 2014, Halyard debuted as a public company following the spin-off, and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol "HYH."
Products[edit]
Halyard Health focuses on seven categories of products.
Surgical Solution products are used in operating rooms and include gowns,[20] trays, drapes, masks, microbial sealant and sterilization wrap.
Digestive Health products are designed for enteral feeding, diagnostics and endoscopy procedures and include feeding tubes, gastric lavage systems, paracentesis needles and trays, endoscopy catheters, cleaning devices and cytology brushes.
Respiratory Health products are designed for airway management and include closed suction catheters,[21] oral care kits,[22] endotracheal tubes and sampling catheters.
Pain Management products include tools to manage chronic and surgical pain such as needles, trays, radiofrequency generators, cooled RF treatment systems, incisional pumps, ambulatory pumps and peripheral nerve block pumps.
Infection Prevention products include equipment designed to protect against contamination and infections such as gloves, gowns, masks,[23] apparel, chemotherapy protective equipment and hand hygiene monitoring.
IV Therapy products include pumps designed for in-home delivery of IV drugs.
Wound Care products include dressings designed to improve healing and maintain moisture.
Lawsuit[edit]
The infection protection Microcool gowns manufactured by Halyard are at the center of a fraud lawsuit against Halyard Health and Kimberly-Clark and profiled on the newsmagazine 60 Minutes.[24] The lawsuit alleges that Halyard knowingly sold Microcool gowns which failed to meet industry standard specifications and could potentially expose medical workers to the patient's bodily fluids. The company denies the allegations and asserts that the gowns which failed to meet specifications were outliers, and that no health care worker has been infected as a result of defective products.[25]
Headquarters/campus[edit]
Halyard Health's campus is located in Alpharetta, Georgia, just north of Atlanta.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Halyard Health are: Joe Woody, Robert E. Abernathy, Gary D. Blackford, John P. Byrnes, Ronald W. Dollens, Heidi K. Fields, Patrick J. O’Leary, Maria Sainz, and Dr. Julie Shimer.[26]
Awards[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, Halyard Health was named a winner of the Practice Greenhealth Champion for Change Awards, recognizing the company's ongoing commitment to sustainability accomplishments in support of people, the planet and products.[27][28]
Halyard Health was awarded Innovative Technology Designation for Coolief Cooled Radiofrequency Treatment at Novation Expo 2015.[29]
Community[edit]
Since Kimberly-Clark's original grant to help launch MedShare in 1998, the company has funded the shipment of $18.5 million worth of supplies to 13 countries in Latin America.[30]
Since then, Halyard examination gloves have been on every MedShare shipment and Halyard Health continues to be one of MedShare’s largest medical product donors. In 2015 Halyard donated $400,000 in medical supplies to MedShare for April 2015 Nepal earthquake relief efforts including surgical gowns, protective masks, and examination gloves.[31]

History[edit]
On March 26, 1872, Kimberly, Clark & Co. was established in Neenah, Wisconsin through the partnership of four businessmen—John A. Kimberly, Havilah Babcock, Charles B. Clark and Frank C. Shattuck.[5]
The first healthcare product by Kimberly-Clark was absorbent wadding, intended to replace cotton. It was used as a bandage for wounded soldiers in World War I. Army nurses adapted the material for menstrual use.[6] Kaycel fabric for surgical gowns was developed by Kimberly-Clark in 1960 for use in field hospitals during the Korean War.[7]
In 1980, Health Care began to grow as it was separated from consumer packaged goods management and products, such as Kleenex, with a move to Roswell, Georgia.[8] Kimberly-Clark Health Care had offices in North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Europe, Asia and India. It also sold its products in more than 150 countries.[9]
Expansion[edit]
Kimberly-Clark Health Care opened European Health Care operations in Brussels in 1991.[10]
In 1999, Kimberly-Clark Health Care expanded into new global markets.[11]
Company acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, Ballard Medical Product, a maker of disposable medical devices for respiratory care, gastroenterology and cardiology, was purchased by Kimberly-Clark for $764 million.[12]
That same year, Kimberly-Clark also acquired TECNOL Medical Products, Inc., a maker of disposable face masks and patient care products.[13]
Kimberly-Clark acquired Safeskin Corporation in 2000, a maker of disposable gloves for healthcare, high technology and scientific industries.[14]
In 2009, Kimberly-Clark acquired Baylis Medial Company’s Pain Management Business and I-Flow Corporation.[15][16]
On April 11, 2016, Halyard announced its agreement to acquire CORPAK MedSystems, a company specializing in enteral access devices. The acquisition is an all-cash transaction for a total consideration of $174 million.[17]
Spin-off[edit]
In November 2013, Kimberly-Clark Corporation announced the company’s plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of the company’s health care business creating a stand-alone, publicly traded health care company. Robert E. Abernathy, would become chief executive officer of the new company.[18]
In May 2014, Kimberly-Clark announced that the Form 10 for the spin-off plan had been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and that the new company, Halyard Health, would be headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia.[19]
The spin-off was scheduled to come into effect on October 31, 2014. At that time Halyard Health applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HYH." One hundred percent of the shares of Halyard Health would be distributed to Kimberly-Clark shareholders, one share for every eight shares of Kimberly-Clark stock.[19]
On November 3, 2014, Halyard debuted as a public company following the spin-off, and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol "HYH."
Products[edit]
Halyard Health focuses on seven categories of products.
Surgical Solution products are used in operating rooms and include gowns,[20] trays, drapes, masks, microbial sealant and sterilization wrap.
Digestive Health products are designed for enteral feeding, diagnostics and endoscopy procedures and include feeding tubes, gastric lavage systems, paracentesis needles and trays, endoscopy catheters, cleaning devices and cytology brushes.
Respiratory Health products are designed for airway management and include closed suction catheters,[21] oral care kits,[22] endotracheal tubes and sampling catheters.
Pain Management products include tools to manage chronic and surgical pain such as needles, trays, radiofrequency generators, cooled RF treatment systems, incisional pumps, ambulatory pumps and peripheral nerve block pumps.
Infection Prevention products include equipment designed to protect against contamination and infections such as gloves, gowns, masks,[23] apparel, chemotherapy protective equipment and hand hygiene monitoring.
IV Therapy products include pumps designed for in-home delivery of IV drugs.
Wound Care products include dressings designed to improve healing and maintain moisture.
Lawsuit[edit]
The infection protection Microcool gowns manufactured by Halyard are at the center of a fraud lawsuit against Halyard Health and Kimberly-Clark and profiled on the newsmagazine 60 Minutes.[24] The lawsuit alleges that Halyard knowingly sold Microcool gowns which failed to meet industry standard specifications and could potentially expose medical workers to the patient's bodily fluids. The company denies the allegations and asserts that the gowns which failed to meet specifications were outliers, and that no health care worker has been infected as a result of defective products.[25]
Headquarters/campus[edit]
Halyard Health's campus is located in Alpharetta, Georgia, just north of Atlanta.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Halyard Health are: Joe Woody, Robert E. Abernathy, Gary D. Blackford, John P. Byrnes, Ronald W. Dollens, Heidi K. Fields, Patrick J. O’Leary, Maria Sainz, and Dr. Julie Shimer.[26]
Awards[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, Halyard Health was named a winner of the Practice Greenhealth Champion for Change Awards, recognizing the company's ongoing commitment to sustainability accomplishments in support of people, the planet and products.[27][28]
Halyard Health was awarded Innovative Technology Designation for Coolief Cooled Radiofrequency Treatment at Novation Expo 2015.[29]
Community[edit]
Since Kimberly-Clark's original grant to help launch MedShare in 1998, the company has funded the shipment of $18.5 million worth of supplies to 13 countries in Latin America.[30]
Since then, Halyard examination gloves have been on every MedShare shipment and Halyard Health continues to be one of MedShare’s largest medical product donors. In 2015 Halyard donated $400,000 in medical supplies to MedShare for April 2015 Nepal earthquake relief efforts including surgical gowns, protective masks, and examination gloves.[31]

History[edit]
On March 26, 1872, Kimberly, Clark & Co. was established in Neenah, Wisconsin through the partnership of four businessmen—John A. Kimberly, Havilah Babcock, Charles B. Clark and Frank C. Shattuck.[5]
The first healthcare product by Kimberly-Clark was absorbent wadding, intended to replace cotton. It was used as a bandage for wounded soldiers in World War I. Army nurses adapted the material for menstrual use.[6] Kaycel fabric for surgical gowns was developed by Kimberly-Clark in 1960 for use in field hospitals during the Korean War.[7]
In 1980, Health Care began to grow as it was separated from consumer packaged goods management and products, such as Kleenex, with a move to Roswell, Georgia.[8] Kimberly-Clark Health Care had offices in North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Europe, Asia and India. It also sold its products in more than 150 countries.[9]
Expansion[edit]
Kimberly-Clark Health Care opened European Health Care operations in Brussels in 1991.[10]
In 1999, Kimberly-Clark Health Care expanded into new global markets.[11]
Company acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, Ballard Medical Product, a maker of disposable medical devices for respiratory care, gastroenterology and cardiology, was purchased by Kimberly-Clark for $764 million.[12]
That same year, Kimberly-Clark also acquired TECNOL Medical Products, Inc., a maker of disposable face masks and patient care products.[13]
Kimberly-Clark acquired Safeskin Corporation in 2000, a maker of disposable gloves for healthcare, high technology and scientific industries.[14]
In 2009, Kimberly-Clark acquired Baylis Medial Company’s Pain Management Business and I-Flow Corporation.[15][16]
On April 11, 2016, Halyard announced its agreement to acquire CORPAK MedSystems, a company specializing in enteral access devices. The acquisition is an all-cash transaction for a total consideration of $174 million.[17]
Spin-off[edit]
In November 2013, Kimberly-Clark Corporation announced the company’s plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of the company’s health care business creating a stand-alone, publicly traded health care company. Robert E. Abernathy, would become chief executive officer of the new company.[18]
In May 2014, Kimberly-Clark announced that the Form 10 for the spin-off plan had been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and that the new company, Halyard Health, would be headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia.[19]
The spin-off was scheduled to come into effect on October 31, 2014. At that time Halyard Health applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HYH." One hundred percent of the shares of Halyard Health would be distributed to Kimberly-Clark shareholders, one share for every eight shares of Kimberly-Clark stock.[19]
On November 3, 2014, Halyard debuted as a public company following the spin-off, and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol "HYH."
Products[edit]
Halyard Health focuses on seven categories of products.
Surgical Solution products are used in operating rooms and include gowns,[20] trays, drapes, masks, microbial sealant and sterilization wrap.
Digestive Health products are designed for enteral feeding, diagnostics and endoscopy procedures and include feeding tubes, gastric lavage systems, paracentesis needles and trays, endoscopy catheters, cleaning devices and cytology brushes.
Respiratory Health products are designed for airway management and include closed suction catheters,[21] oral care kits,[22] endotracheal tubes and sampling catheters.
Pain Management products include tools to manage chronic and surgical pain such as needles, trays, radiofrequency generators, cooled RF treatment systems, incisional pumps, ambulatory pumps and peripheral nerve block pumps.
Infection Prevention products include equipment designed to protect against contamination and infections such as gloves, gowns, masks,[23] apparel, chemotherapy protective equipment and hand hygiene monitoring.
IV Therapy products include pumps designed for in-home delivery of IV drugs.
Wound Care products include dressings designed to improve healing and maintain moisture.
Lawsuit[edit]
The infection protection Microcool gowns manufactured by Halyard are at the center of a fraud lawsuit against Halyard Health and Kimberly-Clark and profiled on the newsmagazine 60 Minutes.[24] The lawsuit alleges that Halyard knowingly sold Microcool gowns which failed to meet industry standard specifications and could potentially expose medical workers to the patient's bodily fluids. The company denies the allegations and asserts that the gowns which failed to meet specifications were outliers, and that no health care worker has been infected as a result of defective products.[25]
Headquarters/campus[edit]
Halyard Health's campus is located in Alpharetta, Georgia, just north of Atlanta.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Halyard Health are: Joe Woody, Robert E. Abernathy, Gary D. Blackford, John P. Byrnes, Ronald W. Dollens, Heidi K. Fields, Patrick J. O’Leary, Maria Sainz, and Dr. Julie Shimer.[26]
Awards[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, Halyard Health was named a winner of the Practice Greenhealth Champion for Change Awards, recognizing the company's ongoing commitment to sustainability accomplishments in support of people, the planet and products.[27][28]
Halyard Health was awarded Innovative Technology Designation for Coolief Cooled Radiofrequency Treatment at Novation Expo 2015.[29]
Community[edit]
Since Kimberly-Clark's original grant to help launch MedShare in 1998, the company has funded the shipment of $18.5 million worth of supplies to 13 countries in Latin America.[30]
Since then, Halyard examination gloves have been on every MedShare shipment and Halyard Health continues to be one of MedShare’s largest medical product donors. In 2015 Halyard donated $400,000 in medical supplies to MedShare for April 2015 Nepal earthquake relief efforts including surgical gowns, protective masks, and examination gloves.[31]

ALPHARETTA, Ga., May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Halyard Health (NYSE:   HYH), a medical technology company focused on eliminating pain, speeding recovery and preventing infection, today announced the availability of the Halyard* Enteral Drainage System, a closed system for the drainage and collection of gastrointestinal tract contents from patients using an enteral device.








Adding to the company's comprehensive portfolio of enteral feeding products, the Halyard Drainage System replaces the need for makeshift drainage products while helping to prevent caregiver and patient exposure to gastric contents. Gastric venting using the Halyard Drainage System may help alleviate the debilitating symptoms of gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting in patients with poor gastric motility, pain and bloating.
Designed specifically for the evacuation of gastric contents, the Halyard Drainage System includes a drainage bag and connective tubing. The drainage bag, which is designed to conveniently hang from the side of the bed with a hanger, can be reused multiple times within a 24-hour period and may help prevent contamination.
The large (18Fr) clear tubing facilitates gastric drainage and allows for visualization of its contents. It can be used with any type of ENFit® feeding tube and utilizes ENFit connectors compliant with ISO standard 80369-3 for a secure connection to extension tubing. A hydrophobic vent helps to relieve gastric pressure and air build-up and prevent gastrointestinal tract contents and fluid from leaking.
"The Halyard Enteral Drainage System fills an important unmet need in the market, giving caregivers the tools they require and eliminating the need for the use of non-enteral drainage products such as urinary bags," said Jamie Handler, director of marketing, North American Core Devices at Halyard Health. "The Halyard Enteral Drainage System is further demonstration of how we continue to offer innovative digestive health solutions and grow our portfolio of enteral feeding products based on our acquisition of CORPAK."   
The Halyard Enteral Drainage System is available immediately. For more information on Halyard's complete line of enteral feeding products for digestive health, visit us at www.halyardhealth.com/digestivehealth.  
About Halyard HealthHalyard Health (NYSE:    HYH) is a medical technology company focused on eliminating pain, speeding recovery and preventing infection for healthcare providers and their patients. Headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, Halyard is committed to addressing some of today's most important healthcare needs, such as reducing the use of opioids while helping patients move from surgery to recovery and preventing healthcare-associated infections. Halyard's business segments - Medical Devices and Surgical and Infection Prevention (S&IP) - develop, manufacture and market clinically superior solutions that improve medical outcomes and business performance in more than 100 countries.

MINNEAPOLIS, May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CleanMed 2017, Booth #208  - Halyard Health, Inc. (NYSE:   HYH), a medical technology company focused on eliminating pain, speeding recovery and preventing infection, today announced a new license and supply agreement with Sustainable Solutions LLC to convert recycled HALYARD* Wrap into environmentally conscious products for healthcare facilities. 








"This new effort with Sustainable Solutions underscores our collective commitment to developing innovative solutions that enable healthcare facilities to take concrete steps to reduce their carbon footprint and achieve their overarching sustainability goals," said Joe Hannibal, Associate Marketing Director, Halyard Health. "Best of all, it represents a natural extension of our BLUE RENEW* Wrap Recycling Program."
This first-of-its kind agreement on this scale is an extension of Halyard's BLUE RENEW* Wrap Recycling Program, designed to offer healthcare facilities a step-by-step approach for easily and efficiently recycling the company's used sterilization wrap. Sustainable Solutions will collect and recycle HALYARD* Wrap waste from customers and convert the material into BlueCON Resin®—the company's proprietary material engineered from cleani HALYARD* Wrap waste. Ultimately, the company will convert BlueCON Resin into sustainable hospital products, including distribution and product totes, garbage cans, bedpans and washbasins. These products are available for direct purchase through Sustainable Solutions.
The program will extend the lifecycle of single-use wrap, allowing healthcare facilities to recycle the more than 30 million pounds of annual wrap waste generated by ORs, and later purchase Sustainable Solutions' recycled products made from BlueCON Resin. Paired with the BLUE RENEW* Recycling Program, this effort will provide healthcare facilities with the tools they need to:

Develop sustainable recycling practices in the OR, 
Reap landfill diversion savings, 
Reduce carbon footprint by purchasing sustainable products, and 
Make a valuable contribution to their institutions' corporate, social and environmental responsibility efforts.

"In today's environment, participating in a recycling program is a tremendous undertaking for hospitals," said Dan Constant, President of Sustainable Solutions, LLC. "Halyard has done a fantastic job of simplifying that process, and our company is thrilled to take the next step by converting waste into sustainable products, and enabling hospitals to play an active role at each step of the sustainability lifecycle." 
To learn more about this initiative, as well as Halyard's other sustainability efforts, please visit us at booth #208 at CleanMed 2017 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, May 16-18, 2017.

There is no guarantee that the process will result in any deal, the sources said.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Halyard Health and Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond to requests to comment.Headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, Halyard has a market capitalization of $1.7 billion. The company operates 11 manufacturing facilities across several countries and employs about 12,700 people.The surgical and infection prevention unit for sale is Halyard's largest business by revenue, notching about $1 billion in sales last year, but it has also been a drag on the company's growth, seeing sales shrink year over year.In its most recent quarter, Halyard reported that sales in its surgical and infectious diseases business declined by 3 percent because of falling prices. Meanwhile, its medical devices business gained 15 percent during the same period.In 2016, Halyard acquired Corpak MedSystems for $174 from buyout firm Linden Capital Partners. The move built on Halyard's existing presence in feeding tubes."We continue to invest in fueling our growth pipeline to shift our portfolio to higher margin faster growing medical devices," Chief Executive Officer Robert Abernathy said during Halyard's quarterly earnings call last month.Halyard became an independent company in 2014 when it was spun off from parent company Kimberly Clark Corp, which sells brand-name hygienic products, such as Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
