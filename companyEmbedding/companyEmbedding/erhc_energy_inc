Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Who We Are | Oil and Gas Exploration | Offshore Drilling
























































                    Who We Are
                    
                



ERHC Energy is a visionary oil and gas company that currently is focused on exploiting its assets -- rights to working interests in oil and gas reserves in Sub-Saharan Africa.
In the Republic of Kenya, ERHC has a strong alliance with CEPSA, which is an experienced exploration and production company. In 2016, CEPSA is scheduled to spud the first well in Block 11A in northwestern Kenya. The Block is in the vicinity of Block 10BB in which significant oil discoveries have recently been announced. East Africa has emerged in recent years as one of the world's most exciting new oil provinces.
In the Republic of Chad, ERHC has interests in Block BDS 2008, which lies next to the Doba Basin oilfield. That field in 2010 had an average daily production of 122,500 barrels of crude oil per day. 
Additionally, the National Petroleum Agency of São Tomé & Príncipe (ANP-STP) on behalf of the Government of São Tomé and Principe has awarded ERHC 100 percent working interests in Block 4 of the São Tomé & Príncipe Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). ERHC also has the option to acquire up to a 15 percent paid working interest in another two blocks of ERHC’s choice. The Company would be responsible for its proportionate share of exploration and exploitation costs in the EEZ blocks.
ERHC has extensive interests in the Nigeria / São Tomé and Principe Joint Development Zone (JDZ) in the Gulf of Guinea. These interests include:

JDZ Block 2:  22.0%
JDZ Block 3:  10.0%
JDZ Block 4:  19.5%
JDZ Block 5:  15.0%

Joint Development Zone - ERHC Energy Houston, Texas USA
























































                    Joint Development Zone
                    
                



Background of the JDZ
In the spring of 2001, Sao Tome & Principe and Nigeria signed a treaty establishing a JDZ for the joint development of petroleum and other resources in the overlapping area of their respective maritime boundaries. The treaty also established an administrative body, the Joint Development Authority (“JDA”), to administer the treaty and all activities in the JDZ. Revenues derived from the JDZ will be shared 60:40 between the governments of Nigeria and Săo Tomé & Príncipe, respectively. The JDZ lies approximately 180 kilometers south of Nigeria, in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the most prolific hydrocarbon regions of the world. 
ERHC’s Rights in the JDZ
In April 2003, the Company and STP entered into an Option Agreement (the “2003 Option Agreement”) in which the Company relinquished significant prior legal rights and financial interests in the Joint Development Zone (“JDZ”) in exchange for preferential exploration rights in the JDZ. Following the exercise of ERHC’s rights as set forth in the 2003 Option Agreement, the JDA confirmed the award in 2004 of participating interests (“Original Participating Interest”) in each of JDZ Blocks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 of the JDZ during the 2004/5 licensing round conducted by the JDA. ERHC also jointly bid with internationally recognized technical partners for additional participating interests in the JDZ during the 2004/5 licensing round. As a result of the joint bid, ERHC won additional participating interests (“Joint Bid Participating Interest”) in Blocks 2, 3 and 4. 
ERHC’s JDZ Acreage
ERHC has working interests in six of the nine Blocks in the JDZ, as follows: 

JDZ Block 2: 22.0%
JDZ Block 3: 10.0%
JDZ Block 4: 19.5%
JDZ Block 5: 15.0% (in arbitration)
JDZ Block 6: 15.0% (in arbitration)
JDZ Block 9: 20.0%

The working interest percentages represent ERHC’s share of all the hydrocarbon production from the blocks and obligates ERHC to pay a corresponding percentage of the costs of drilling, production and operating the blocks. Through Exploration Phase 1 in blocks 2, 3 and 4, these costs have been carried by the operators. The operators can only recover their costs by carrying ERHC until production whereupon the operators will recover their costs from production revenues.
In 2009, Sinopec and Addax, ERHC's technical partners and operators in Blocks 2, 3 and 4 undertook an exploratory drilling campaign across the three blocks that was completed in January 2010.
Biogenic gas was discovered in each block and discussions continue between the Joint Development Authority and the parties, including ERHC, that hold interests in JDZ Blocks 2, 3 and 4, regarding drilling results. The meetings with the JDA are aimed at reaching a definitive agreement on how to proceed with the next stage of exploration in the Blocks following the expiration of Exploration Phase I in March 2012. 
JDZ Operations Update
The JDZ partnership is currently assessing the data for possible new exploration play concepts in this area.

More on ERHC Energy's operations:
 
Republic of Kenya. ERHC has a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Government of the Republic of Kenya on Block 11A in northwestern Kenya. The Block is in the vicinity of Block 10BB in which significant oil discoveries have recently been announced. East Africa has emerged in recent years as one of the most exciting, new oil provinces in the world with the discovery of over 1 billion barrels of recoverable oil in Uganda’s Block 1 (EA1), the Ngamia-1 oil discovery in Kenya, which is estimated to be bigger than the Ugandan discovery, and large gas discoveries, including the recent Zafarani find, offshore Tanzania. For more on ERHC's operations in Kenya, click here.
 
Republic of Chad. ERHC has interests in Block BDS 2008 in the Republic of Chad. The government of Chad formally awarded the company the oil block for exploration and development in June 2011. A Production Sharing Contract was signed in July 2011. Chad is one of sub-Saharan Africa’s significant crude oil producers with proven oil reserves of 1.5 billion barrels. It share borders with Nigeria, Cameroun and Sudan, which all produce oil as well. For more on ERHC's operations in Chad, click here.
 

São Tomé & Principe’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The government of São Tomé & Principe has awarded ERHC rights to participate in exploration and production activities in São Tomé & Principe’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which encompasses an area of approximately 160,000 square km.
