Dune Real Estate Partners Closes Fund III with Capital Commitments of 
      $960 Million






October 28, 2014 05:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dune Real Estate Partners LP (“Dune”), a leading New York-based real 
      estate investment firm, today announced the closing of its third real 
      estate fund, Dune Real Estate Fund III (“Fund III”), with $960 million 
      in capital commitments, substantially exceeding its $850 million target.
    


      Like its predecessor funds, Fund III is focused on an opportunistic 
      strategy concentrating on distressed, deep value-add and contrarian 
      investments, primarily in the United States. Fund III already has 
      projected equity commitments of $263.5 million in eight investments 
      across the U.S., including a residential portfolio in Las Vegas, a 
      high-end Los Angeles retail portfolio, industrial properties in Oakland, 
      and a luxury residential development in Miami.
    

      Led by five Partners who have an average of 25 years of real estate 
      experience, Dune has raised $2.5 billion of equity capital and currently 
      manages $3.6 billion of assets. The firm raised its capital from a broad 
      mix of institutional investors, including public and corporate pension 
      funds, endowments and foundations and high net worth families, in 
      addition to a significant commitment from the firm’s professionals.
    

      “We are pleased to announce the final closing of our third fund at a 
      level that exceeded our target and would like to thank all of our 
      investors for their support,” said Daniel Neidich, Founder and CEO of 
      Dune. “The successful close underscores the strength of our team and 
      differentiated strategy, and we view our investors’ enthusiasm as a 
      strong endorsement of our investment approach. We see tremendous 
      opportunities ahead and look forward to putting Fund III to work.”
    

      “We are very pleased to have a highly diversified group of both new and 
      long-standing investors, who have demonstrated their confidence in our 
      ability to source, execute and manage a high-quality portfolio of 
      opportunistic real estate investments,” added Cia Buckley Marakovits, 
      Partner and CIO of Dune. “By leveraging our deep industry and capital 
      markets experience, we are uniquely positioned to pursue and capitalize 
      on exciting investment opportunities.”
    

      “Monument Group was privileged to work once again with Dune on this 
      fundraise,” said Lori Campana, Managing Director at Monument Group. 
      “This successful fundraise is a testament to the Dune team, whose depth 
      and breadth of experience positions Fund III to deliver strong 
      performance results for investors.”
