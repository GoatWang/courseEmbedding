04/20/17: 12:49 PM: NEW RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES RADIOPROTECIVE EFFECT OF BETA-D-GLUCAN
Recent publication of research in the Journal of Clinical Diagnosis Research on February 11, 2017 states the following, "It is shown that beta-D-glucan is an immunologic system booster with radioprotectory effects. Radioprotectors are chemical components that can alleviate biological damage produced by ionizing radiation." Source: PMID:28384957; PMCID: PMC5376999.  Additional published research on beta glucan and irradiation can be found at www.betaglucan.org. The beta glucan used in the research was not provided by NSC but was beta 1,3/1,6 glucan. 
04/07/17: 2:40 PM: NEW POSITIVE RESEARCH INVOLVING "LUNG CANCER AND B-GLUCANS : 
New Research involving Beta 1,3 glucan and lung cancer reports, “β-glucans…potentiate the immune system against microbes and toxic substances. Moreover, β-glucans are known to exhibit direct anticancer effects and can suppress cancer proliferation through immunomodulatory pathways." Source: PMID 28303629    Note:The research utilized beta 1,3,glucan from a source other than NSC.
03/31/17: 11:37 PM: DEEP BREATHING CALMS YOU DOWN AS IT MAKES BRAIN CELLS TELL THE BODY TO RELAX
Just breathe! Slow, deep breathing actually works in the brain to create a sense of calm. Breathing deeply reverse engineers your mood by triggering neurons in your brain which tell the body to relax.  Researchers at Stanford U. of Medicine and the U. of California have identified 175 brain cells (neurons) which spy on the breath and alter state of mind accordingly. The study comes as 'transformational breathing' is a health trend involving deep and slow breaths claimed to induce a powerful state of calm, lowers blood pressure and sharpens thinking.  Sources: http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/03/study-discovers-how-slow-breathing-induces-tranquility.html  and http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4367628/Deep-breathing-tells-body-relax-brain-cells.html#ixzz4cuo9UW00 
03/29/17: 10:58 AM: ISRAELIS DEVELOP EXTREMELY ACCURATE BLOOD TEST TO DIAGNOSE LUNG CANCER 
Lung cancer is one of the most violent types of cancer, responsible for the death of 1.6 million patients each year with 1.8 million diagnosed annually. A first of its kind blood test developed in Israel and based on the genetic characterization of cancer, succeeds in diagnosing the lung cancer long before it spreads in the body. 
Study results showed an extremely high accuracy level in contrast to most current tests with 94% accuracy meaning 94% of  test subjects identified as healthy were in fact healthy and a sensitivity of 75% indicating 75% of the patients identified as diseased were actually diseased. Dr. Elon Ganor stated, “We are convinced that this test will indeed save hundreds of thousands of people every year worldwide."  Source: http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4942284,00.html

Plastic Surgery procedures continue to increase, with a 3% increase to 17.1 million in 2016, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.  The increase was influenced by an 18% annual increase in use of new injection-based procedures that attempt to correct fat pockets in areas such as the chin.  “Fat freezing” appointments increased 5% in the past year, with personal research on the procedure recommended prior to usage.  Source: https://us-mg5.mail.yahoo.com/neo/launch?.rand=7vuuugivtvh6b#684647270
02/15/17: 11:15 AM: FDA GENERIC DRUG APPROVALS SAVES U.S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ABOUT $1.68 TRILLION IN DECADE IN DRUG COSTS
According to the FDA, generic drugs have saved the U.S. healthcare system about $1.68 trillion over the last 10 years.  In 2016 the FDA’s Office of Generic Drugs in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research granted more than 800 generic drug approvals - full and tentative; the highest ever.  Lower overall drug prices often result due to lower priced generic versions of popular drugs creating price competition and in turn more affordable pricing for a specific drug.

Strains of tuberculosis extensively resistant to almost all antibiotic drugs usually used to treat the bacterial TB type have been spreading in South Africa; already experiencing a high tuberculosis infection program.  TB infected people expel bacteria from the lungs when coughing, sneezing or just speaking.  The study notes the  bacteria can float for hours if conducive conditions prevail, infecting those persons who breathe the bacteria internally.  Source: New England J of Medicine - http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1604544?query=featured_home
12/27/16: 4:43 PM: ONE MILLION VIRUSES PLUS REMAIN MYSTERIES TO RESEARCHERS SEEKING PREVENTIVE MEASURES
The World Economic Forum, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust have formed the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations with the goal to help fund the creation of vaccines that are badly needed but not likely to turn a profit for drug makers. A pilot project called PREDICT has discovered about 1 thousand new viruses over 7 years, but more than 1 million remain a mystery.
Scientists have estimated about 1.3 million undiscovered viruses exist in the world of which about a half million may be zoonotic viruses that can transfer from animal species to infect and spread among people.  Planners of the Global Virome Project have estimated cost of $3.4 billion to locate and gather at minimum preliminary information on 99% of those unknown viral threats.  Such information is critical to be able to attempt to prevent viral outbreaks instead of responding after significant viral infections, as is now almost always the situation in health epidemics.

12/11/16: 6:35 PM: U.S. DEATH RATE GROWS; LIFE EXPECTANCY DECLINES FOR UNITED STATES
The CDC has reported for the first time since 1999, the U.S. death rate is on the rise while life expectancy at 78.8 years is down. For a baby born in 2015, the life expectancy has dropped slightly.  In a trend reversing fifteen years of increasing life expectancy, the number of deaths for every 100,000 U.S. residents rose 1.2% from 2014 to 2015. The CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics report co-author, Jiaquan Xu, stated as an epidemiologist, the increase is significant.

12/05/16: 4:01 PM: RESEARCH INDICATES ASTHMA TRIGGER FOUND TO BE CALCIUM SENSING RECEPTORS
Researchers at Cardiff University have identified which cells trigger the airways to narrow associated with asthma when initiated by irritants like pollution. Asthma is caused by inflammation in the small tubes which carry air and out of the lungs. Drugs used to treat osteoporosis known as calcilytics already exist which can deactivate the affected cells. 
Experiments on mice and human airway tissue found calcium sensing receptors or CaSR cells which detect changes in the environment become hyper in asthmatics, triggering airway inflammation, and narrowing.  In testing, when calcilytic drugs were inhaled, involved cells were deactivated and symptoms relieved.  Source: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/15/asthma-could-be-cured-within-five-years-after-drug-breakthrough/
11/16/16: 5:04 PM: WORLDWIDE POPULATION TREND IN HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE: PERCENTAGE DOWN – NUMBER UP
According to a new study published in The Lancet, although decreasing percentage wise worldwide, the estimated number of adults with high blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015, comprising 597 million men and 529 million women.  The good news related to blood pressure is age-standardized prevalence of high blood pressure decreased globally from 1975 to 2015, from 29.5% to 24.1% in men and from 26.1% to 20.1% in women. Thus the hard number increases were due primarily to population increases worldwide and an aging population.  Source: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31919-5/fulltext
11/08/16: 9:55 AM: AARP 2016 STUDY: MANY CAREGIVERS SPEND $7K ANNUALLY OUT OF POCKET
According to an AARP survey conducted of 1,864 family caregivers in July and August, 2016,  more than 3 out of 4 caregivers absorb out-of-pocket costs currently averaging nearly $7,000 a year. Those costs consumed the equivalent of a fifth of caregivers’ incomes on average and the burdens were even greater for those with lower incomes, the group reported. The most financially strapped caregivers tap savings or take out loans to meet expenses.
More than 40 million family caregivers each year provide unpaid care for aging parents, spouses, aunts, uncles, friends, or other loved ones so they can live independently at home, where they want to be (87%). These family caregivers assist with daily tasks—such as eating, dressing, bathing and transportation as well as medical/nursing tasks. The value of this unpaid care is about $470 billion dollars annually.    http://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/ltc/2016/2016-caregiving-wa-45plus-care-act-rc-ltc.pdf
10/27/2016: 12:34 PM: BETA GLUCAN NUTRITIONALLY CONTRIBUTES TO PROTECTION OF KIDNEYS FROM RENAL FAILURE 
Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common cause of acute kidney injury and results from an impairment of oxygen and nutrient delivery to, and waste product removal from, cells of the kidney. There is mismatch of local tissue oxygen supply and accumulation of waste products of metabolism.  This imbalance causes injury of tubular epithelial cells; and, if severe, death occurs due to apoptosis and necrosis (cell death). ”… β-glucan is effective to protect kidneys from ischemia-reperfusion-induced oxidative damage,…” Source: PubMed 27677198: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27677198 .  Note:The research utilized b-glucan from a source other than NSC.
10/13/2016: 10:27 AM:  WORLDWIDE TB EPIDEMIC INFECTS 10.4 MILLION – KILLING 1.8 MILLION IN 2015
Worldwide the tuberculosis epidemic exceeds projections, infecting 10.4 million people with 1.8 million deaths in 2015, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) Global TB Report 2016. WHO reported 300,000 more deaths than in 2014, while an unacceptable 40% went undiagnosed and untreated. TB is a contagious bacterial lung infection often with oral blood expulsion.  480,000 in 2014 were diagnosed with multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB).  Source: http://www.who.int/tb/en/ . See research also: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hetland%20G%2C%20Sandven%20P with PubMed 11985967
In the U.S., 9,421 TB cases were reported in 2014, with 66% among foreign-born persons. The Centers for Disease Control warned government employees that the unaccompanied minors flooding across the border in recent years are carrying diseases.  “We might as well plan on many of the kids having TB,” according to a CDC environmental health scientist, Alaric C. Denton email to employees preparing to go to the border to deal with the influx. Source: http://www.wnd.com/2016/04/cdc-warns-of-tb-risk
10/06/16: 9:33 AM: AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BECOMING UNAFORDABLE WITH RATE HIKES UP TO 60% AND SKYROCKETING DEDUCTIBLES
To compensate for huge losses in ObamaCare plans, insurance companies are requesting double-digit rate hikes, in some cases up to 60%, and sky-rocketing deductibles in many cases. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has sharply downgraded the CBO’ long-term enrollment forecast for the exchanges. Most of the 23 government-created insurance co-ops have also failed, reducing plan choices in several areas to one provider.
Among the millions of Americans who have signed up for the Affordable Care Act since 2013, an estimated 25% or more were covered before the law required a change from their existing plans.  Analysts calculate Obamacare's overall enrollment performance has been far below initial actuarial forecasts by 24 million.  And as taxpayers pay an estimated $2 trillion to pay for a failing law, CBO has determined uninsured Americans are expected to rise from 26 to 28 million between 2017 and 2026.
Aetna is abandoning plans to expand into five other states and reviewing whether to stay in the 15 states where Aetna (AET) currently sells ObamaCare plans.  Aetna's announcement follows UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) decision to leave most ObamaCare markets, Humana's (HUM) decision to drop out of some and Blue Cross Blue Shield's announcement to quit certain markets now served.
09/28/2016: 12:04 PM: C. DIFF DEADLY BACTERIA CONTRIBUTES TO 29,000 HEALTCARE FACILITY DEATHS ANNUALLY
Clostridium difficile aka “C. diff” is a deadly bacterial infection that sickens almost 500,000 people and contributes to some 29,000 deaths annually, the vast majority in hospitals and other healthcare settings.  Consumer Reports states statistics show about a third of the more than 3,100 hospitals evaluated received a low rating for C. diff infection control, meaning C. diff infection rates were worse than the national benchmark.
To help reduce C. diff occurrence, the CDC has issued detailed protocols for hand hygiene, room cleaning and suggestions about nurse-to-patient ratios. The biggest risk factor for C. diff infection is antibiotic overuse and, while improving, excess antibiotics prescribed are still a controllable but major issue.

09/16/2016: 9:24 AM EST: ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT BACTERIA CAUSE 2 MILLION+ ILLNESSES AND 23,000 DEATHS IN U.S. ANNUALLY
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that every year at least 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States are caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The problem is especially serious for patients who have few viable antibiotic options; this can occur with certain types of serious bloodstream infections and with gonorrhea infections, among others. Scientists are concerned that resistant strains of bacteria could spread globally through travel or trade, including the exchange of foods.  An immune system at peak can minimize antibiotic needs by enabling the body to utilize 1/5 of all cells representing the immune system to help protect what seeks to harm the human body.
Overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals helps drive the evolution of resistant bacteria. Why? The bacteria have a natural tendency to mutate and to acquire genes from other bacteria. These changes can enable them to resist the antibiotics and flourish in environments where antibiotics are used. As the resistance genes move between bacteria, the bacteria themselves spread through soil, water, and wildlife. Over time, with continued antibiotic use, the situation worsens.

09/14/2016:4:34 PM EST: HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OUT OF CONTROL IN 35% OF U.S. ADULTS
High blood pressure can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and death. About 70% of US adults age 65 or older have high blood pressure and only about half have it under control (less than 140/90 mmHg).  See a brief YouTube video on High Blood Pressure .
Blood pressure medicine (along with a healthy diet and exercise) can protect the heart, brain, and kidneys, but only if patients take it and keep their blood pressure controlled. However, at least 25% of adults, ages 65 or older, with Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance are not taking their blood pressure medicine as directed either as to amount or when taken, thus increasing health risk enumerated above.  Sources: http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/blood-pressure/index.html; YouTube Video: http://www.nsc24.com/videos.html
09/01/2016: 9:34 AM EST: STUDY FINDS HOUSEHOLD DUST EXPOSES PEOPLE TO DANGEROUS CHEMICALS
The Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., has released research showing household dust exposes people to multiple toxic chemicals, led by DEHP in a class of chemicals called phthalates that can represent serious health threats. Second were chemicals called phenols used in cleaning and other household products followed by flame retardants and highly fluorinated chemicals found in non-stick cookware. [DEHP: di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]
Phthalates are common; present in household cleaners, food packaging (plastic covers of meats etc), dry cleaning clothing covers, cosmetics, fragrance, and personal-hygiene products. Household dust was found to have phthalates in the highest concentration of toxic chemicals present.

08/23/2016: 11:23 AM EST: ZIKA VIRUS DEATHS NOW IN U.S. WITH ZIKA MOSQUITOS NOW IN FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA
The Zika Virus is now confirmed in the Miami, Florida area as a result of spread by local mosquito's transmission, with 300+ projected by mid-September. Health officials have now advised pregnant women to stay away from the downtown Miami, Florida, due to the risk of spread of the Zika Virus that can cause microcephaly involving potential birth defects. California now has 170 confirmed cases from Zika bearing mosquitoes now found in Southern California. Zika deaths in the U.S. involving victims that had contracted Zika elsewhere have occurred in Utah and Texas.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports on the CDC website nationally 529 Zika cases with pregnant women and 2,260 total.  In U.S. Territories Zika cases involving pregnant women are 691 with total cases 8,035.  The Zika Virus can also be sexually transmitted, possibly being even more infectious from person to person than from mosquitoes.
08/11/2016: 4:17 PM EST: STUDY INDICATES HIGH LEVELS OF TOXIC PFASs CHEMICALS IN DRINKING WATER OF 6 MILLION  AMERICANS     
Many public drinking water sources serving 6 million Americans contain levels of PFASs chemicals called polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances that exceed recommended levels by the federal government according to researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  According to the EPA PFASs are used in a broad range of consumer goods such as cleaners, textiles, leather, paper and paints, fire-fighting foams, wire insulation and in food packaging.
Elsie Sunderland, a senior author of the study said, "These compounds are potent immunotoxicants in children and recent work suggests drinking water safety levels should be much lower than the provisional guidelines established by EPA." Immunotoxicants refer to compounds that interfere with the function of the body's immune system, potentially contributing to the development of infectious diseases or even cancer, as the immune system fails to fight them off.

In a peer reviewed article in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, researchers Y Cao, et al reported “B-Glucans have been shown to reduce the risk of obesity and diabetes.” The orally administered pure B-(1,3) glucan in mice significantly down-regulated the blood glucose through suppressing the sodium glucose cotransporter SGLT-1 expression in intestinal mucosa.  SGLT-1 plays a major role in glucose absorption and incretin hormone release in the gastrointestinal tract.
Incretin hormones stimulate insulin secretion in response to meals.  The animal study also found pure B-glucan promoted glycogen synthesis or breaking down of stored glucose and inhibited fat accumulation in the liver while depressing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Glycogen is the principal storage form of glucose in animal and human cells.  Cytokines are cell signalling protein molecules that aid cell to cell communication in immune responses.  Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27396408 .  Note:The research utilized beta 1,3,glucan from a source other than NSC.
07/22/2016: 4:48 PM EST: IMMUNE SYSTEM MICROGLIA MACROPHAGES PROVIDE SUPPORT IN BRAIN AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INCLUDING FOR FUNCTION AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
Recent scientific studies in neuropsychopharmacology are supporting the idea that the immune system provides support for the nervous system at various levels.  Microgia macrophage immune cell presence within the central nervous system and brain has been shown to be important for brain tissue maintenance and function. Researchers suspect a link may be present between meningeal immunity and neural circuits recruited for social behavior.

07/18/2016: 11:25 AM: BOOSTING NON-SPECIFIC IMMUNE SYSTEM IS BEST DEFENSE AGAINST BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS SAYS FORMER SOVIET BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS SCIENTIST
In an interview with Natural News Staff Writer Ethan A. Huff,  Dr. Kanatjan Alibekov says genetically modified (GM) bioweapons made from super-virulent disease strains are par for the course when it comes to advanced weapons systems, and the use of such bioweapons is an ever-present threat. Dr. Alibekov served from 1988 to 1992 as the First Deputy Director of the Biopreparat, the Soviet Union's biological weapons program.
Dr. Albekov stated,"... biological weapons could be used in the future. In my opinion, that's not a matter of if; that's a matter of when. ...If we are able to boost our non-specific immune system, that's the most appropriate and the only way to develop protection. ... vaccines are not a magic bullet."

07/11/16:4:53 PM: TWO CONFIRMED U.S. CASES OF SUPERBUG EXEMPT FROM  LAST RESORT ANTIBIOTIC
Two U.S. cases of a superbug that resist a last-resort antibiotic have been revealed. Infectious disease experts expect more cases due to the causal bacterial gene more widespread than previously reported. U.S. Army scientists have found E. coli bacteria that harbor a gene which renders the antibiotic colistin useless. The mcr-1 gene was discovered in a urine sample of a Pennsylvania woman being treated for a urinary tract infection. The bacteria can be transmitted by fecal contact and poor hygiene, which suggests potential widespread existence, according to leading infectious disease experts.
The mcr-1 superbug has been identified over the past six months in farm animals and people in about 20 countries, including China, Germany and Italy. Researchers have also confirmed preliminary findings of E. coli carrying the same mcr-1 gene in a stored bacterial sample of a New York patient who previously treated for an infection last year, in addition to in patient samples from nine other countries. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, led by Mariana Castanheira of JMI Laboratories based in North Liberty, Iowa provided the information.
07/07/16:2:55 AM: CDC MONITORING 320 PREGNANT WOMEN IN U.S. AFTER ZIKA FOUND
Evidence of the Zika virus has been found in at minimum 320 pregnant women in the U.S. according to current data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden called the virus a “silent epidemic” as it continues to spread rapidly across the Americas.
06/27/16 10:56 AM EST: AMERICANS SPEND $30.2 BILLION A YEAR OUT-OF-POCKET FOR COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH APPROACHES 
Richard Nahin, lead epidemiologist at the U.S. Nat’l Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, reports the 2012 National Health Interview Survey found about 59 million Americans spend 30.2 billion a year on complementary health approaches, including practitioners, natural product supplements and related materials.
$12.8 billion was spent by Americans on natural product supplements, or about 25% of what was spent on prescription drugs. Additionally, $2.7 billion was expended in 2012 in the U.S. on books, CDs, videos and other self-help materials related to complementary health.
Complementary medicine related spending amounted to just over 9 percent of out-of-pocket health care expenditures and about 1 percent of all money spent on health care in the United States according to researchers. The Survey found about $28 billion was spent on adults, compared with just $1.9 billion for children.

06/20/16 8:33 AM EST: ZIKA INFECTIONS INCREASING RAPIDLY IN PUERTO RICO ACCORDING TO THE CDC. 
Puerto Rico as a US commonwealth has the highest Zika occurrence in the U.S. states and commonwealths with almost 1,400 cases reported. There have also been a total of 756 cases reported according to latest statistics in the continental US. More than 60 countries and territories have been affected by the ongoing Zika outbreak.
To date 234 pregnant women in the continental US have shown lab evidence of Zika infection.  In a teleconference with reporters on June 17, 2016, Tom Frieden, CDC Director, announced the increase in Zika infections in Puerto Rico could mean, “in the coming months, it is possible that thousands of pregnant women” could be infected and “this could lead to dozens or hundreds of infants being born with microcephaly in the coming year,... .”
06/10/16 7:55 AM EST:  U.S. TUBERCULOSIS (TB) CASES RISE TO 66% FOREIGN-BORN PATIENTS – TRIPLE 22% IN 1986 
The government’s huge increase in allowed inflow of tuberculosis (TB)-carrying migrants appears to have reversed a 23-year decline of contagious tuberculosis cases inside the United States. Tuberculosis spreads when carriers cough or exhale TB bacteria.
American-born active TB cases have declined 80% from an estimated 17,725 in 1986 to 3,201 in 2015 while the number of foreign-born cases has increased from 5,000 up to 6,335 during the same period. The 1986 data appears in the CDC’s May 10, 1996 MMWR Weekly Report, “Tuberculosis Morbidity — United States, 1995.
The CDC states, “For people whose immune systems are weak, ... the risk of developing TB disease is much higher than for people with normal immune systems."  Source: https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/basics/tbinfectiondisease.htm
06/05/16 8:55 AM EST: NEW BLOOD-BASED “LIQUID BIOPSY” AN ALTERNATIVE TO TISSUE REMOVAL BIOPSY
Philip Mack, Director of molecular pharmacology at the U. of California, Davis, Comprehensive Cancer Center, reports a new blood-based "liquid biopsy" could be a groundbreaking alternative to present arduous and painful biopsies requiring physical removal of a piece of tissue from a living body.
In the research blood was drawn from a patient's arm to analyze DNA tumors typically shed into the bloodstream. The study involving more than 15,000 patients with 50 different tumor types determined liquid biopsy can accurately detect mutations in cancer DNA.  "If we saw a mutation in the plasma, that meant it was in the tumor," said Mack, who is presenting the findings at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, in Chicago June 4-5, 2016.
Liquid biopsies provide valuable information for doctors using targeted therapies including immunotherapy to treat cancer because they detect when tumors develop resistance "through the acquisition of new mutations that allow it to circumvent or otherwise ignore a therapeutic option," Mack said. "If we identify what that mutation is, we can treat with a different therapy."
05/24/16 5:48 AM EST:  ZIKA VIRUS IN USA IS NOW 544 TRAVEL-RELATED CASES, WITH 832 LOCALLY TRANSMITTED CASES IN U.S. TERRITORIES
According to the CDC, 544 travel-related USA cases of Zika virus infection have been reported from January 1, 2015 to May 18, 2016, with an increase of 41 cases in the previous week. Of the 45 affected states, New York is highest with 114 cases, surpassing Florida which has 109 and California with 44.
In the US territories of American Samoa, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, the number of locally transmitted cases has jumped to 832; up 134 cases in a week with a significant increase from the 698 cases reported a week ago to the CDC. Of the 832 cases of local transmission, Puerto Rico accounted for 803 cases or 97%, with an increase from 669 cases of local transmission in a week. Meanwhile, American Samoa and US Virgin Islands reported 14 and 15 cases respectively.
As of May 12, 2016, the two Zika virus infection surveillance systems are monitoring 157 pregnant women in the U.S. states and 122 pregnant women in the U.S. territories with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection. 
05/20/16 7:32 AM EST: FDA ANNOUNCES REVISED NUTRITION FACT PANEL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD
The FDA has updated Label disclosure requirements for the “Nutrition Facts” panel on 800,000 foods, first introduced in 1994. Updated label requirements, emphasize calorie counts and added sugars.
Revised labels will now be required to state "percent daily value" for sugars, disclosing how much of the recommended daily intake the sugar content of a food product will provide. 2016 guidelines recommend no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugar, a limit estimated at 200 calories or 50 grams.
Labels also must now list levels of potassium and Vitamin D in addition to iron and calcium. Disclosure of Vitamins A and C content is no longer required. Major food companies have until July 2018 to comply while companies with less than $10 million in annual sales have 3 years.  
05/16/16 4:10 PM EST: MAJOR UNIVERSITY RESEARCH CONFIRMS MICROPARTICULATE (MG) BETA GLUCAN SUPERIOR
Two studies of beta 1,3/1,6 glucan are reported by researchers at Zagreb University in Croatia, a major University with 7,900 faculty and 72, 480 students. The two studies confirm that small microparticulate beta glucan [MG beta glucan] of 1 to 2 microns is a preferable size for improved immunological activity versus large particle and/or aggregated [clumped together] glucan to boost the immune response.  Quotes with findings from the two reports follow:
“The macrophage phagocytosis is more enhanced by microparticulate B-glucan than by its aggregated [clumped large particle] form. ...Biological activity of B-glucan can be improved by reducing the size of its particles.  The particles having 1-2 µm [microns] in diameter are optimally phagocytized by macrophages.” [internalized by the macrophage immune cells].”  “It is known that immunological activity of b-glucan depends on particle dimensions and can be improved by reducing the size of the particles.”
The enhanced immune benefits of microparticulate glucan were further stated in U.S. Patent 6,476,003 (http://www.nsc24.com/dSMPatent.htm)  which included the statement, "As the glucan re-aggregates to a size of greater than one micron in diameter, some of the beneficial effect of the glucan is not achieved because the macrophage receptors are not activated as readily by glucan greater than one micron in diameter because the receptor size on corresponding cells and molecules that accept the glucan is generally about one micron in size. ..."  
A Peer-reviewed article from "Letters in Applied Microbiology" also confirms from major medical school research that nonaggregated microparticulate beta glucan, uniquely processed (MG Glucan), is more potent in nutritionally and naturally potentiating the immune response, "A microparticulate form of B-glucan [MG]...that...has superior immune  characteristics has been developed.  ...In conclusion, we have developed a new method for preparing homogeneous, nonaggregated, 1-2 micron diameter B-glucan containing particles from yeast cell walls. Compared with the aggregated form of B-glucan, the B-glucan microparticles...are more effective at enhancing phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages following oral administration. ...The greater percentage phagocytosis demonstrates the enhanced activity of the macrophage and the small particle size glucan's ability to activate the immune system."
To "Phagocytize" is the process by which a cell digest, internalizes or engulfs microorganisms including pathogens. Macrophages are large white immune cells.

05/04/16: 6:39 PM EST: MEDICAL ERROR NOW THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES
A new report published the BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) finds if medical error was a disease, medical errors  would rank as the third leading cause of death (251K) in the United States behind Heart Disease (611K) and Cancer (585K).  Without reason, death certificates in the U.S. used to compile national cause of death statistics, have no method for acknowledging medical error.
The Study finds the system for measuring national vital statistics should be revised to facilitate better understanding of deaths due to medical care estimated at 251,000 annually, 700 per day or 9.5% of all annual deaths in the United States.  Source:  http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139
04/21/16:  4:57 PM EST:  RARE BACTERIAL OUTBREAK OF ELIZABETHKINGIA REPORTED IN 3 STATES 
The Illinois Department of Public Health recently announced that a patient there having the bacteria Elizabethkingia anophelis has died.  Previously, there were 59 people in Wisconsin and one person in Michigan also reported to have the infection.  So far, this outbreak has been linked with 20 deaths, or roughly 1/3 of those infected. 
In prior years, Elizabethkingia cases have only been about five to 10 per year, according to the CDC, making this outbreak the largest ever of this strain in the US.
Most of those infected have been people over 65 years old who had at least one serious underlying health condition and often have weakened immune systems, as reported by the CDC.  Most of the cases have had an infection in the bloodstream.  However, in a few cases, the bacteria was found in the respiratory tract.
Elizabethkingia is resistant to many antibiotics typically prescribed to treat bacterial infections, but doctors have identified some that have worked in treating the bacteria in the current outbreak, according to the CDC.  Source: http://www.cdc.gov/elizabethkingia/outbreaks/index.html
04/14/16: 11:46 AM EST:  SUGAR ADDICTION SIMILAR TO DRUG ABUSE – NEW TREATMENT STRATEGY STUDIED
A recent study by Australia’s Queensland University published in the PLOS ONE Research Journal shows drugs used to treat nicotine addiction could be used to treat sugar addiction in animals.  WHO recent data reports 1.9 billion people worldwide are overweight with 600 million obese.
Researcher Masroor Shariff stated, “Like other drugs of abuse, withdrawal from chronic sucrose exposure can result in an imbalance in dopamine levels and be as difficult as going ‘cold turkey’ from them.”
The study results suggest that current FDA-approved nAChR drugs such as varenicline may represent a novel new treatment strategy to address the obesity epidemic to the extent affected by addictive sugar/sucrose intake.  The study did not cover the negative impact of sugar on the human immune response.  Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814119/ - PMC4814119 - PLoS One. 2016; 11(3): e0150270
04/05/16: 10:21 AM EST: STATIN DRUGS STUDY CONFIRMS MILLIONS HAVE MUSCLE PAIN ISSUES SIDE EFFECTS
The Cleveland Clinic Study presented in JAMA on April 03, 2106 stated, “Statin intolerance related to muscle symptoms represents a major unresolved challenge to the delivery of optimal cardiovascular care. The reported incidence of statin-associated muscle symptoms in observational studies ranges from 5% to 29% of treated patients, varying by statin and dose.“
Approximately 36 million Americans at present take statin drugs to lower LDL bad cholesterol levels with 3 to 4 million suffering side effects as primarily muscle pain and spasms, according to Dr. Steven Nissen as the lead researcher in the Cleveland Clinic study. 
Another study from the Nutrition and Infection Laboratory at Harvard Medical School published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1999 (PubMed 10426696) found non-prescriptive beta glucan as, “The yeast-derived ß-glucan fiber lowered total cholesterol and raised HDL-cholesterol concentrations significantly.”
04/01/16: 10:25 AM EST: OBESITY EPIDEMIC BAD AND GETTING WORSE
The Lancet medical journal in the April 2, 2016 issue states in a study review that one in five adults could be obese by 2025, resulting in an epidemic of "severe obesity" with significant health and economic costs. Of about five billion adults alive in 2014, 641 million were determined obese by the study . The obesity number was set to exceed 1.1 billion by 2025 based on study results.
The ratio of obese adults has more than doubled in the 40 years since 1975, and will climb further in the coming nine, the research showed according to research author Majid Ezzati. Health issues associated with obesity include high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, heart disease and some cancers plus organ damage. The ability of the immune system to perform properly at peak is also impaired by obesity and health issues increase due to an impaired immune response.
Lifestyle changes including diet, exercise, adequate sleep, stress management and supplementation in areas lacking in implementation are necessary to stop or lessen the trend illustrated by the study. Source: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30054-X/abstract
03/25/16:9:01 AM EST: IMMEDIATE-RELEASE OPIOD PAINKILLERS KILL 28,650 IN 2014 – GET NEW WARNING LABEL
On March 22, 2016, the FDA announced all immediate-release opioid painkillers must contain new boxed warnings containing information about the risks of addiction, abuse, overdose and death. Opiod products were distributed in 135 million+ prescriptions in 2012 with over $9 billion in sales. Immediate-release opioid painkillers, sold primarily as Vicodin and Percocet, were involved in 19,000 deaths in 2014 involving misuse and abuse according to the CDC, while heroin and opioid painkillers including codeine and hydrocodone, combined caused 28,650 fatal overdoses. 
The CDC released national prescribing guidelines for using opioids, stating doctors should only turn to opioids after considering physical therapy, over-the-counter medications, counseling and other methods for treating chronic pain.
03/16/16: 10:55 AM EST: PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS A MAJOR SOURCE OF “SUPERBUG” SPREAD
The Journal of the American Medical Assc JAMA Internal Medicine has published research from the U. of Michigan finding almost 25% of patients tested had some sort of drug resistant germ on their hands when they were discharged from the hospital to a post-acute care facility such as a nursing home, rehabilitation center or hospice; thus being a major source of spreading “superbug” infections. About 2 million people suffer antibiotic-resistant infections in the U.S. associated with 23,000 deaths. The CDC reports 1 in 25 hospital patients has obtained an infection while in the hospital.

While a mild flu season in November and December of 2015, influenza is now rapidly expanding at a time it usually begin to dissipate. Now at a 7% rate, 7.7% is required to qualify as an epidemic, but cases continue to increase daily. The flu vaccine, according to the CDC, has been 60% effective this season versus 20% last year. A strong immune response is important to have a fast and effective response against the flu virus. MG beta glucan in NSC-100 Extra Strength Immunition is a medical school researched nutritional biological defense modifier to contribute to normalization and potentiation of immune cells.
03/10/16: 10:10 PM EST: MD ANDERSON STUDY - HIGH GLYCEMIC INDEX DIET ELEVATES BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS, INCREASING LUNG CANCER RISK
A new epidemiologic study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center finds consuming a diet with a high glycemic index, a classification of how rapidly carbohydrates elevate blood sugar levels, was independently associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer in non-Hispanic whites.  Lung cancer is the 2nd most common cancer in both men and women, but the leader in cause of cancer mortality, with over 150,000 deaths from lung cancer projected in 2016 by the American Cancer Society.  
The study reports diets high in fruits and vegetables may decrease risk, while increased consumption of red meat, saturated fats and dairy products have been shown to increase lung cancer risk.  A 49% increased risk of lung cancer was found among study subjects with the highest daily glycemic index, compared to those with the lowest daily glycemic index.

02/26/16: 5:34 PM EST: ZIKA VIRUS CASES IN UNITED STATES GROW RAPIDLY IN 2016
Reports of people sickened by Zika virus are growing quickly in the U.S., according to CDC information on February 26, 2016. Evaluation suggest pregnant women have significant risk from Zika virus infections with five of nine pregnant women who traveled to affected areas having complications when exhibiting Zika symptoms.
CDC Director Tom Frieden reported the CDC has now received 147 reports of Zika illnesses in the United States. The large majority amounting to 107 were travelers who brought the disease home from foreign locations.
The other 40 cases involved people infected locally, primarily in U.S. territories. Puerto Rico has confirmed 117 cases overall, making it the most affected U.S. area, The pregnancy complications due to Zika and the 14 reports of possible sexual transmission, have surprised CDC officials.   Source: http://www.wsj.com/articles/reports-of-zika-cases-growing-quickly-in-u-s-1456521970 
02/26/16: 5:05 pm EST: CDC REPORTS OVERALL INFLUENZA VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS SO FAR IN 2016 AT 60% OVERALL VERSUS 20% IN 2015
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today reported preliminary overall influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 59 percent this season. These data were presented at the CDC Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices in Atlanta, Georgia. "This means that getting a flu vaccine this season reduced the risk of having to go to the doctor because of flu by nearly 60 percent,” said Joseph Bresee, M.D., chief of CDC’s Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. The CDC further reported there was 51 percent vaccine effectiveness against the H1N1 viruses responsible for most flu illness this season.
Another way to evaluate the statistic is 4 out of 10 vaccine users overall are not protected by the flu vaccine shot IN 2016, with 5 out of 10 unprotected for the most common flu form in 2016. However, in the previous flu season the CDC reported 8 out of 10 vaccine users were not protected.  Avoidance of influenza of all types can be enhanced by avoiding being in the vicinity of exposure, washing of hands and maintaining a strong immune response to protect against the flu viruses.  http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/flu-vaccine-60-percent.html
02/23/16: 12:18 PM EST: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ELIMINATING ENTRY BAN FOR 3 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES, ACCORDING TO CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES, $18-$100 MILLION COST TO U.S.
A new Federal ruling will further reduce the ability of the U.S. immigration system to protect Americans from communicable diseases.  The Federal Registry entries for January 26, 2016 include, “Accordingly, this [final rule] will: Revise the definition of communicable disease of public health significance by removing chancroid, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma venereum as inadmissible health-related conditions for aliens seeking admission to the United States.” 
Chancroid is a bacterial infection that causes open sores on the genitals. Granuloma inguinale is a bacterial disease characterized by ulcerative genital lesions. Lymphogranuloma venereum is a form of the common sexually transmitted infection chlamydia, with about 3 million reported chlamydia cases annually in the U.S. 
With the rule change, the only named diseases which would bar entry of non-citizens as “communicable diseases of public health significance,” are tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis, and gonorrhea.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) removed HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection from the list of diseases that keep people who are not U.S. citizens from entering the United States beginning January 4, 2010. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the cost of lifting the ban on Chancroid, Granuloma inguinale and Lymphogranuloma venereum on infected non-citizens would be less than $100 million annually.  Source: http://cis.org/Obama-Opens-the-Border-to-More-STDs
02/03/16:11:05 PM: ZIKA VIRUS DECLARED BY WHO TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY 
The World Health Organization has declared February 2, 2016, the Zika virus and its suspected complications, a public health emergency of international concern; an action taken only three times before by the W H O. No vaccine or medications are available to prevent or treat Zika. The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne virus caused by the Aedes mosquito.  The WHO estimates the virus will reach almost all of the Western hemisphere and infect up to 4 million people by year's end.
The mosquito-borne illness has been linked to a condition called microcephaly, which is associated with children having an abnormally small head and underdeveloped brain at birth. Zika symptoms include fever, rash, reddened eyes and joint pain. The concern is not just for babies. Zika has also been linked in Brazil to Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes paralysis.
01/27/16: 3:44 PM:  RUSSIAN EPIDEMIC-80 DEAD WITH 12,000 BEING TREATED DAILY NATIONALLY WITH FLU – PRIMARILY SWINE H1N1 FLU 
A swine flu outbreak has to date taken 30 lives in Saint Petersburg, Russia’s second largest city.  The extremely high rate of seasonal flu has forced Russian authorities to close schools while residents overwhelm area pharmacies for scarce flu fighting supplies, remedies and medicines.  Avoiding those ill, frequent washing of hands and maintaining a strong immune system are urged as protective measures.
While Saint Petersburg has recorded the highest number of swine flu deaths, the outbreak in progress has claimed 80 victims nationwide in Russia since the start of the winter, according to AFP calculations based on statements by regional officials.  Authorities say some 12,000 people are being treated with flu symptoms every day and up to 80 percent of these cases could be swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus.  The H1N1 virus, a form of flu that is particularly damaging to younger, healthy people, swept the globe in a worldwide pandemic that is believed to have killed 200,000 people in 2009.

01/21/16: 7:11 AM:  ZIKA VIRUS CASES INCREASING  IN  U.S. TRAVEL WARNING ISSUED BY CDC
U.S. health officials are reporting new cases of Zika, a mosquito-borne virus caused by the Aedes mosquito.  The mosquito-borne illness has been linked to a condition called microcephaly, which is associated with children having an abnormally small head and underdeveloped brain at birth. Zika symptoms include fever, rash, reddened eyes and joint pain. 
Health officials state there is no risk to the U.S. public to date because all the cases so far have been in returning travelers who were likely infected by mosquitos abroad rather than by mosquitos in the U.S. mainland. Brazil's health ministry reported January 19, 2016, that 3,530 babies have been born in Brazil with the Zika virus since October 2015. More than a dozen U.S. cases of the Zika virus have now been confirmed including in Florida, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and Hawaii and have been traced back to overseas travel.
The CDC has issued a travel alert warning pregnant women to avoid 14 countries and territories including Brazil, Puerto Rico, Panama, Mexico and Haiti.  There is no vaccine and no course of treatment for the Zika virus now available.  Source: http://www.cdc.gov/zika/ and http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/s0315-zika-virus-travel.html
01/18/16: 1:24 PM: TICKS THAT CARRY LYME DISEASE NOW IN 50% OF ALL U.S. COUNTIES
Lyme disease is a debilitating flu-like illness caused by Borellia bacteria.  The ticks transmitting Lyme disease are spreading rapidly across the United States over the past 20 years with the two species known to spread the disease to humans having advanced into half of all the counties in the United States.
Lyme disease cases have tripled in the United States over the last 2 decades, making it the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. The disease now affects around 300,000 Americans each year. If diagnosed early after a rash usually appears around the site of the tick bite, Lyme disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics. However, longer term infections can produce more serious symptoms, including joint stiffness, brain inflammation, and nerve pain.  Source: http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/lyme-disease-carrying-ticks-are-now-half-all-us-counties
01/17/16: 1:15 PM: NEW RESEACH INDICATES MEN SUFFER MORE INTENSELY THAN WOMEN FROM INFLUENZA DUE TO REDUCED ESTROGEN
Research reported by the American Journal of Physiology addresses the reality of the "man flu," described as men suffering more intensely from influenza than women. Scientists found hormones better protect women against the worst symptoms of the influenza virus after examining blood samples from both men and women with the flu virus.  The female samples with higher levels of estrogen fought off the flu virus much faster than the male samples.
The suggested protocol for avoiding influenza is to avoid areas where people are infected with influenza, wash hands frequently and keep the immune response strong and normalized in contrast to being immuno-compromised.

01/15/16: 6:15 PM: NEW HIGHLY PATHOGENIC MUTATED BIRD FLU STRAIN FOUND IN INDIANA POULTRY
The U.S. government confirmed the presence of a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana, the country’s first case since the end of last year’s outbreak that led to the destruction of 50 million animals. The H7N8 strain discovered at a 60,000 BIRD flock in Dubois County is different from those that caused the 2015 outbreak, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service said Friday.
Preliminary tests indicate the H7N8 strain found in Indiana was of North American origin, according to the USDA spokesman, T. J. Myers.  To avoid a repeat of the nation’s worst-ever avian-influenza outbreak, the USDA has stockpiled millions of doses of a new vaccine designed to fight the 2015 strain, but the 2015 strain is different than the new mutated bird flu strain discovered in Indiana, with coverage ability unaddressed by the USDA, but unlikely. Avian influenza doesn’t present a food safety risk. All shipments of poultry and eggs are tested to ensure the absence of avian influenza before moving into the food supply.

01/11/16: 10:58 PM: BRAIN IMMUNE CELLS REPAIR AND SEAL BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER, DESTROY PATHOGENS AND HELP CONTROL INFLAMMATION 
A new study reveals the brain's immune system structure involving microglia immune cells plays a central role in the process of repairing damage to the blood brain barrier that protects the brain from infection and inflammation.  The microglia are the resident macrophage immune cells of the brain and spinal cord.  The Microglia immune cells can be activated to perform different functions in the brain such as the control of inflammation, destruction of pathogens, cleaning up the cellular debris (phagocytosis), and the rapid sealing at an injury site to the blood brain barrier protecting the brain.  
Researchers in an animal study observed when small holes where made in the blood brain barrier, microglia macrophage immune cells rapidly mobilized to repair the breach. In most instances, the integrity of the blood brain barrier was restored by the microglia immune cells within 10 to 30 minutes.

01/01/16: 10:35 PM: DEPRESSION HAS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE IMMUNE RESPONSE
New research published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research investigates the immune systems of people with depression who were found to produce an increased inflammatory response. This inflammation can lead to the production of neurotoxic compounds that kill brain cells. In a negative cycle, depression leads to inflammation in the brain, which further increases the feelings of depression.
To investigate the immunological component, the team took samples of the depressed patients' blood and measured the levels of nine chemicals with eight found to be elevated above normal.  The substances hsCRP, TNF-alpha, IL6 and MCP1 were also significantly higher.

12/12/15: 5:35 PM: WILL NEW OR MUTATED FLU VIRUSES CIRCULATE THIS FLU SEASON AGAIN NOT INCLUDED IN FLU VACCINE AS HAPPENED LAST YEAR?
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports flu viruses are constantly changing and it's not unusual for new seasonal flu viruses to appear each year. These are viruses that have small antigenic or genetic changes but which have evolved from previously circulating human seasonal flu viruses.  When viruses change in that way, they are said to be “drifted” viruses. Most of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses circulating so far in 2015 were different (drifted) from the H3N2 vaccine virus component in the 2014 vaccine.  Once in a while, a new, non-human flu virus emerges to infect people. This is very different from the drift that is observed with seasonal flu viruses, and can cause a pandemic.  Source: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2014-2015.htm . Comment: The flu vaccine for 2014-15 was only 30% effective, leaving an estimated 210 million or more out of 300 million in U.S. unprotected against the primary influenza viruses that attacked last season.
Wash hands and avoid the sick. Keep your personal immune response strong through proper diet with sugar limitations, adequate sleep and water, moderate exercise and stress management as your primary defense against all pathogens, including influenza that seeks to make you ill and which can be fatal, particularly for the elderly and immuno-compromised. When lacking in personal lifestyle actions, supplement to help nutritionally keep your immune cells normalized and potentiated.

12/08/15: 5:35 PM: U.S. PRIMARY BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM DEFENSE SYSTEM UNRELIABLE BASED ON REPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
The United States’ primary defense system aimed at identifying biological terrorism embodied in a billion-dollar network of air samplers in cities around the country are unreliable at best and cannot be counted on to detect attacks, says a new report by the Government Accountability Office. The Los Angeles Times reported that the BioWatch system, developed and introduced in 2003, has been problematic almost from the outset, frustrating officials with several false alarms because it is not capable of distinguishing between harmless germs and deadly pathogens that terrorists would be most likely to deploy in a bio-attack.
Homeland Security, which has BioWatch oversight, has regularly praised the effectiveness of the system while looking to upgrade it with newer technology. But the GAO’s report challenges those claims even as it highlights the nation’s vulnerability to bio-terrorism at a time of renewed concerns about the capabilities of the Islamic State. Source:    http://www.nationalsecurity.news/2015-11-25-govt-watchdog-says-systems-to-detect-bioterrorism-are-unreliable-and-should-be-replaced.html .  See also Frank Jordan's brief video on Health Bioterrorism:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxpSzLFlYcA
12/07/15: 10:01 AM: IMMUNOTHERAPY REVEALS CANCER CELLS PRESENCE TO ENABLE IMMUNE CELLS TO RECOGNIZE AND KILL CANCER CELLS
The American Cancer Society reports, "Immunotherapy includes treatments that work in different ways. Some boost the body’s immune system in a very general way. Others help train the immune system to attack cancer cells specifically. ... an important part of the immune system is its ability to tell between normal cells in the body and those it sees as 'foreign.' This lets the immune system attack the foreign cells while leaving the normal cells alone.
To do this, it uses 'checkpoints' – molecules on certain immune cells that need to be activated (or inactivated) to start an immune response. Cancer cells sometimes find ways to use these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. But drugs that target these checkpoints hold a lot of promise as cancer treatments."  Source: http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/immunotherapy/immunotherapy-what-is-immunotherapy
Proteolytic enzymes can also enhance the immune cells ability to recognize cancer cells. Proteolytic enzymes taken orally enhance the white immune cells ability to better recognize and attack bacteria, viruses and cancer cells; the latter by eliminating cell protein layers disguising the pathogenic cancer cells. The Proteolytic enzymes also enhance the immune response by promoting formation of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin I-b and interleukin 6.
12/04/15: 12:15 PM: FUNGAL DISEASES KEY CAUSES OF MORBIDITY AND DEATH IN IMMUNO-COMPROMISED PATIENTS
News Medical is reporting invasive fungal diseases are key causes of morbidity and death in immuno-compromised patients and represent major drivers of increased healthcare costs. Up to 10% of patients with hematological malignancies suffer from fungal infections after their immune systems are weakened by high-dose chemotherapy. If unable to mount an effective immune response to the fungal infection, up to 50% of these patients die as a consequence of fungal infection.
Early diagnosis and management of invasive fungal infections are key to improving survival among immunocompromised patients, but current diagnostic procedures are limited. Aspergillus fumigatus is mainly responsible for the increased incidence of the devastating condition invasive aspergillosis in patients with weakened immune systems.

Research in a peer reviewed article in Cellular Immunology reports MG Beta Glucan has been studied extensively for its immunostimulatory properties with those properties providing an interaction between the MG Beta Glucan and dendritic cell receptors for beta glucan that serve as an activating signal promoting anti-fungal immunity.  The report from the U. of Nevada School of Medicine, Dept of Microbiology and Immunology under the direction of Kenneth W. Hunter ScD further reports MG Beta Glucan, "also has a long history of use as an adjuvant to promote immune responses to tumors and other microorganisms." 
The results of the study show Microparticulate glucan (MG) acts as an adjuvant, or an immunological agent that enhances the effects of other agents present, to conjugated [joined] vaccine antigens with the result to enhance antigen presentation by dendritic immune cells to CD4 (Helper) and CD8 (Cytotoxic killer) T-cells. Nutritional Scientific Corporation supported the research in part by a grant, but was not involved in the design or interpretation of the experiments.  SOURCE: V.K Berner et al, "Microparticulate B-glucan vaccine conjugates phagocytized by dendritic cells activate both naive CD4 and CD8 T cells in vitro," Cell.

11/16/15: 12:13 PM: RECENT RESEARCH EXPLORES HOW THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM COULD BE MANIPULATED TO BETTER RECOGNIZE AND FIGHT DISEASE
Dr Shalin Naik from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute reported dendritic cells are intelligence-gathering immune cells, gathering information on viruses, bacteria, cancer and fungi to aid the immune system in fighting disease. Dendritic cells communicate to the infection-fighting T cells and NK cells what a virus, bacterium, fungus or cancer looks like so they know what they're looking for when fighting disease.
Recognition is the first step to responding and resolving pathogen challenges to the body. Dr. Naik stated, "If we learn how to control dendritic cells, we could strengthen our immune response to infection when needed, or weaken the action of certain immune cells that attack the body's own tissues in autoimmune disease." Source: https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9_GzOPYAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=9_GzOPYAAAAJ:q09DtPQ_434C

11/07/15: 7:50 am: 150 MILLION OUT OF 250 MILLION U.S. ADULTS USE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS (59%) – UP 8% IN 11 YEARS
Almost 6 in 10 American adults take a prescription drug, with 37 million taking 5 or more simultaneously! The puzzle is if Americans are getting healthier, why the huge increase in prescription drug use?  Prescription drugs require a prescription because there are unwanted side effects associated with any and all prescription drugs necessitating a risk/reward evaluation by a prescribing physician before each prescription issuance.
Statin use, primarily for high cholesterol, is now prescribed for 42 million U.S. adults, with Zocor alone  taken by 20 million!  High blood pressure drugs were taken by 27% or 65 million, while antidepressants usage increased to 32 million plus. The conditions of high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol created rapidly increasing levels of prescription drug usage. The researchers emphasized many of the issues creating prescription drug usage can be resolved by proper diet and lifestyle changes, both of which enhance your natural immune response defenses. 
The study results were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey involving 38,000 adult participants. Source: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2467552
10/27/15: 10.01 am: LACK OF ADEQUATE RESEARCH IN RECENT GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUES HAS SCIENTISTS STYMIED
Lack of adequate research has Scientists stymied and frustrated as to how to learn from and stop the multitude of recent global health issues from the deadly MERS virus, to a new killer strain of bird flu, to the fatal Ebola outbreak.  Needed extensive research to analyze disease sources and test experimental drugs or vaccines during worldwide epidemics in recent years has been almost totally absent in occurrence.
As an example, in the H1N1 flu pandemic governments stockpiled and doctors prescribed antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza, but no proper randomized clinical trials were conducted on those involved to determine whether the prescription drugs were even beneficial. Studies of immune response status of residents in affected areas are almost non-existent but critical to know because without adequate immune responses, vaccines afford no protection.
Clinical trials in a health outbreak are difficult because emphasis is on recognizing and treating an enormous number of sufferers for a new or rare strain of disease that usually overwhelms available health services. But epidemic research during an event is also burdened by crushing bureaucratic red tape that can take months to even begin a study. Research has to be authorized in advance to the extent feasible and then embedded in the immediate response to an outbreak, and not come after the epidemic has occurred and diminished.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), MERS has a high 35% fatality rate with 1,569 MERS cases and 554 deaths worldwide as of 09/21/15, with occurrence increasing.
All cases of MERS to date have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV cases now include the UK, U.S. and South Korea. In spite of MERS risks, the U.S. State Department has announced 100,000 refugees from the Arabian Peninsula and Syria will be allowed through 2016 to immigrate into the United States.

08/19/15: 2:37 pm: CDC REPORTS FLU STRAINS INCLUDED IN 2015-16 FLU SHOTS IN U.S.  FLU SHOTS 18% EFFECTIVE IN 2014 IN FULL FLU PREVENTION LAST YEAR
Flu vaccines are designed to protect against the main flu viruses that research suggests will be the most common during the upcoming season. Three kinds of flu viruses commonly circulate among people today: influenza A (H1N1) viruses, influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and influenza B viruses.  All of the 2015-2016 influenza vaccine is made to protect against the following three viruses:

an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus
an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus
a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus. (This is a B/Yamagata lineage virus)

Some of the 2015-2016 flu vaccine is quadrivalent vaccine and also protects against an additional B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus). This is a B/Victoria lineage virus.
According to reporting done by the United States Centers for Disease Control, the 2015 vaccine was just over 18 percent effective (less than 1 in 5 flu shots) in fully preventing the flu, although the shot decreased the severity of symptoms for millions of recipients.  During this most recent season, more than 500,000 cases of influenza were confirmed within the United States.
08/12/15: 7:30 am: IMMUNOTHERAPY DRUGS NEW CANCER RESPONSE?
Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to respond to cancer or other diseases. Cancer or other pathogens seeking to harm the body may develop when the immune system breaks down or is not functioning adequately. Immunotherapy works by either stimulating your immune system to attack cancer cells or providing your immune system with what it needs, such as normalized immune cells or antibodies, to fight cancer and other health challenges.
Common types of immunotherapy include monoclonal antibodies that are man-made versions of immune system proteins. Antibodies can be useful in treating cancer because they can be designed to attack a very specific part of a cancer cell.  Immune response normalizers nutritionally or chemically enhance immune cells ability to respond to dangerous pathogens. Cancer vaccines, most experimental, are substances designed to trigger an immune response in the body against certain diseases;  often with unwanted side effects.
What are called non-specific immunotherapies stimulate the immune system to respond with increased activity and potency against cancer cells and other pathogens. While many new immunotherapy drugs are in development, the immune response can be protected naturally by proper diet, adequate rest, moderate exercise, stress management and quality nutritional supplementation.
08/11/15: 9:56 am: PATIENTS WITH SPIRITUALITY EXPERIENCE FEWER PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS OF CANCER AND TREATMENT

Twelve persons have now died in a renewed outbreak of Legionnaires’ Disease in the Bronx of New York City. One hundred twelve cases of Legionnaires’ Disease have been reported since July 10, 2015. Legionnaires’ Disease is a severe, often lethal, form of pneumonia spread through the air caused by exposure to the bacteria Legionella. In most cases, exposure to the Legionella bacteria is due to inhaling contaminated aerosols from cooling towers, hot tubs, showers and faucets or drinking water.  
08/02/15: 6:26 pm: DIAGNOSTIC  DUODENOSCOPES SPREAD DEADLY BACTERIA – 3 KNOWN DEATHS – FDA PONDERS ACTIONS
In the diagnosis and treatment of issues in the digestive tract, such as cancers, gall stones and blockages in the bile duct, a long black flexible scope called a duodenoscope is threaded down a patient’s throat. Nearly 700,000 such procedures involving a duodenoscope are performed annually in the U.S.
Unknown to the involved hospital, an unusually potent version of CRE, or carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, had contaminated a duodenoscope after normal sterilizing procedures failed to remove the bacteria fatal in up to half of all exposures to patients. Unfortunately, antibiotics are usually powerless in stopping the infection once introduced in the body.
By mid-February 2015, eight patients had been infected by the contaminated scopes, and three died. Nearly 180 other patients were exposed and advised to get tested. The FDA in May 2015 held a two-day hearing about the scope-related outbreaks. Manufacturer, Olympus, declined to participate. The attending medical experts determined Olympus’ duodenoscopes were unsafe, but shouldn’t be pulled off the market because of being a potentially life-saving procedure with no better alternative. The FDA is evaluating future actions, with a redesigned duodenoscope still far from becoming a reality.  Patients beware!

07/06/15: 9:56 am: LEPROSY NOT ERADICATED IN U.S. IN 2015! MULTIPLE NEW CASES IN FLORIDA
So you thought Leprosy has been eradicated since flourishing in Biblical times? Wrong. The state of Florida reports nine leprosy cases to date in 2015.  Surprising to most, is the fact Florida usually has an average of four cases of reported Leprosy annually.  Cause?  Again according to the Florida Department of Health, the  reason for the leprosy increase in Florida are armadillos.   The CDC says armadillos are sometimes naturally infected with leprosy and, although normally nocturnal feeding at night, during the breeding season which is summer, the armadillos have more contact with humans. 
While armadillos are a nuisance digging up a yard, they are the only animals that can literally walk under water.  Armadillos are strange breeders that reproduce with either four boys or four girls – always identical quadruplets.  Sage advice: Do not pick up, pet or have an armadillo as a pet.

The shooter in the Charleston church massacre, Dylann Storm Roof, was reportedly taking Suboxone (buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride), a narcotic drug used to treat opiate addiction including heroin and linked to sudden outbursts of violence.  Drug induced sudden outburst of violence is a pattern of most other mass shooters who were also on or had recently come off pharmaceutical drugs linked to aggression. Dylann Roof had been stopped previously by police with the drug Suboxone on his person.
Other major mass shooters taking some form of SSRI or other pharmaceutical drug at the time of their attacks, include Columbine killer Eric Harris, ‘Batman’ shooter James Holmes and Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza. The website SSRI Stories documents hundreds of examples of mass shootings, murders and other violent episodes committed by individuals on psychiatric drugs over the past three decades.
Pharmaceutical giants who produce drugs like Zoloft, Prozac and Paxil spend more than $2 billion per year on direct-to-consumer television advertising and make major political contributions.  Is it any wonder negative stories about prescription drug-associated crimes are minimized and often absent reporting or comments by news outlets or politicians?  
06/11/15: 8:50 am EST: EGG PRODUCTION CRISIS IN U.S.
A massive outbreak of H5N2 avian influenza has left nearly 47 million chickens dead or dying and caused a serious egg shortage in the U.S. as a result.  The AP reports that nearly 35 million of the dead chickens were egg-laying hens that accounted for 80 percent of the “breaker” market. In commercial terms, eggs are usually classified as either “breakers” or “shell eggs.” As the name suggests, “breakers” are cracked open and then turned into other egg products—such as the dried, liquefied, or frozen eggs commonly used in commercial food-service applications. “Shell eggs” are eggs that get to retain their shells, and are what consumers buy for personal usage from the grocery store.  Prices in many areas of doubled to tripled in recent days with egg imports significantly increased.
06/10/15: 1:46 pm EST: ACCIDENTAL ANTHRAX RELEASE IN 18 STATES AND 52 LABS
At least 52 labs in 18 states may have received potentially live spores of anthrax that should have been inert and were used to create samples for research. the Pentagon said.  31 personnel who came in close contact with the samples are now on the antibiotic Cipro; however, the Pentagon said it is certain the greater public is not at risk. The Pentagon has launched a website with updates and information: http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2015/0615_lab-stats/.
06/08/15: 12:36 pm EST: NUTRITIONAL SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION ANNOUNCES NEW 2 YEAR BETA GLUCAN RESEARCH PROJECT WITH U. OF NEVADA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
After 17 years of continuous Medical School research under the direction of Kenneth W. Hunter, Jr. ScD and his staff, in the Dept. of Microbiology, U. of Nevada School of Medicine, a continuation of that medical school research related to MG Beta 1,3/1,6 glucan will commence immediately sponsored by Nutritional Scientific Corporation.  Pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodyamics previously performed on the MG Beta 1,3/1,6 glucan processed in a jointly developed system by NSC and UNR will be further studied and performed using flow cytometry.
The pharmacokinetics study will contribute to understanding the adsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the MG Beta 1,3/1,6 glucan following oral administration. Systemic immune effects of the MG Beta 1,3/1,6 glucan will additionally be investigated  on hematopoietic cell types in the peripheral blood, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and peritoneal cavity. The results from these studies will lay the ground work for additional studies of the effects of B-glucan on various disease states.
05/25/15: 10:27 am EST: XDR "HARD TO TREAT' TUBERCULOSIS BEING TREATED AT NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC
Federal and state officials are now tracking down hundreds of people who may have had contact with the female patient diagnosed with extensively drug resistant and extremely dangerous XDR Tuberculosis.  The patient was transferred to the NIH via special air and ground ambulances and is in isolation. Ordinary TB is not highly contagious but when contracted can take weeks of antibiotic treatments. XDR-TB resists the effects of almost all known TB drugs.  Only at this time 1/3 to 1/2 of infected patients with XDR-TB can be cured.
05/16/15: 7:35 am EST: BETA GLUCAN MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY
The "Advanced Pharmaceutical Journal" in a peer reviewed article published in August 2014 stated, "Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy in the world. Beta glucan may improve quality of life in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy."  This study was performed by Ostadrahimi A, et al, and was conducted on 30 women with breast carcinoma. The Abstract conclusion stated, "The findings suggest that Beta glucan may be useful as a complementary or adjuvant therapy for improving quality of life in breast cancer patients in combination with cancer therapies.  PMID: 25364665  [PubMed]: PMC4213788 [Note: The Beta glucan used in this study was not MG Beta glucan provided by NSC]
04/30/15: 8:55 am EST: LISTERIA IN BLUE BELL ICE CREAM CREATES RECALL
Listeriosis is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium (germ) Listeria monocytogenes. People at high risk for listeriosis include pregnant women and their newborns, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems. Symptoms can occur up to 70 days after ingestion.
On April 20, 2015, Blue Bell Creameries voluntarily recalled all of its products currently on the market made at all of its facilities, including ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet, and frozen snacks, because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Testing and clearance for marketing to begin again for Blue Bell products is in progress.
04/21/15: 9:33 am EST: FALSE HEADLINE ON MULTI-VITAMINS AND MINERALS - AGAIN!
According to the headline in national media, "Dietary supplements, such as over-the-counter multivitamins, do 'more harm than good' and can increase the risk of developing cancer and heart disease, according to research in the US." Except this study at the U. of Colorado wasn’t a study, but a compilation of other studies with varying controls together with varying vitamin/mineral sources, characteristics and qualities.
Professor Tim Byers, Associate Director for cancer prevention at the U. of Colorado, actually concluded not the taking of proper doses, but excessive intake beyond that recommended, of vitamins and minerals including vitamin E, selenium, beta carotine and folic acid, could cause more harm than good. The headline blasted to America by major media was false.
No comments were made on the highly increased negative health risks of taking doses in excess of recommended amounts of pharmaceutical drugs used to fight cancer. Then Professor Byers lumped all dietary supplements; not just the ones on which data was compiled, in the misleading headline conclusion. Professor Byers, buried deep in the published reports, stated his evaluation of supplements taken actually was, “Taking the correct dosage was harmless.” 
04/15/15: 8:34 am EST: DIMINISHED ARGiNINE IN BRAIN LINKED TO CAUSE OF ALZHEIMER'S 
According to the CDC, in 2013 as many as 5 million in the U.S. had Alzheimer’s Disease, the most common form of dementia. Research results recently announced show in the early stages of Alzheimers, microglia immune cells that normally protect the brain undergo changes due to abnormally high levels of the enzyme arginase that breaks down the needed amino acid, arginine, in the brain area. Alzheimer's disease causes abnormal plaques and tangles of protein fragments that build up between brain cells. Plaques are clumps of sticky beta-amyloid protein and tangles are twisted strands of tau protein.
The researchers found where neurons had died in regions of the brain important for memory, that the altered microglia and arginase were highly expressed. When the enzyme arginase was blocked, both the altered microglia immune cells and placque were reduced, while the animals did better on memory test. The research team from Duke University reported findings in “The Journal of Neuroscience.” The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Alzheimer's Association, and the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation.
03/25/15: 10:06 am EST: BENADRYL LINKED TO INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S 
A study from the U. of Washington School of Pharmacy reported in JAMA Internal Medicine journal found a significant link between anticholinergic drugs and an increased risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly.  Anticholinergics are a drug class that blocks or impedes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain and body and include Benadryl (diphenhydramine) together with various non-prescription sleep aids.  Benadryl is described by the manufacturer as treating allergies, severe allergic reactions and motion sickness as an antihistimine. Side effects of Benadryl and other anticholinergic drugs include drowsiness, constipation, urine retention, dry mouth and dry eyes.
The study included 3,434 men and women aged 65 and over, with no dementia signs at the study beginning. The study covered a 10-year cumulative dose-response relationship during which 797 participants developed dementia and 636 Alzheimer's. (Source: "Cumulative use of strong anticholinergics and incident dementia: a prospective cohort study," Gray SL, Anderson ML, et al, JAMA Intern MEd, 2015 Mar 1:175(3):401-7.

03/21/15: 4:10 pm EST: STRESS RELATED TO REDUCED IMMUNE RESPONSE 
Stress acts on the body through the immune system, and in recent years we have been learning that chronic inflammation -- the immune system's response to injury or irritation -- may be involved in everything from heart disease and diabetes to Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. So, indirectly, a stress-related imbalance in the immune system may have a wider-ranging effect than originally suspected.
"Our studies have shown that stress can adversely affects components of the immune system involved in fighting diseases like cancer," says David Spiegel, MD, a psychiatrist and researcher at Stanford University. The number of natural killer or NK cells -- cells that kill undesirables like bacteria and cancer cells -- has been found to be lower among people who are suffering from chronic stress according to Spiegel, who also directs Stanford's Center on Stress and Health. 
A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that higher psychological stress levels resulted in a higher likelihood of catching the common cold. The researchers accounted for many variables -- including the season; alcohol use; quality of diet, exercise, and sleep; and levels of antibodies before exposure to the virus -- and concluded that higher stress was to blame for lowered immunity and higher infection rates.  Source: David Spiegel Interview in HealthDay article, “The Immune System and Stress” by Paige Bierma, M.A.
03/15/15: 3:55 pm EST: EFFECTS OF BETA-GLUCANS ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
"Beta glucans ...increase host immune defense by activating complement system, enhancing macrophages and natural killer cell function. ...beta-Glucans also show anticarcinogenic activity. They can prevent oncogenesis due to the protective effect against potent genotoxic carcinogens. As an immuostimulating agent, which acts through the activation of macrophages and NK cell cytotoxicity, beta-glucan can inhibit tumor growth in promotion stage too.
Anti-angiogenesis can be one of the pathways through which beta-glucans can reduce tumor proliferation, prevent tumor metastasis. beta-Glucan as adjuvant to cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy demonstrated the positive role in the restoration of hematopiesis following by bone marrow injury. " http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17895634  for complete research study.

03/09/15: 6:59 pm EST: AUSTRALIAN MED SCHOOL RESEARCH SHOWS BETA GLUCANS REDUCE RISK FACTORS OF DIABETES AND COMPLICATIONS
As reported in Vascular Health Risk Management involving John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Acton, ACT, Australia, "Diabetes mellitus is characterized by high blood glucose level with typical manifestations of thirst, polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. ...The major risk is vascular injury leading to heart disease, which is accelerated by increased lipid levels and hypertension.  Management of diabetes includes: control of blood glucose level and lipids; and reduction of hypertension.
Dietary intake of beta-glucans has been shown to reduce all these risk factors  to benefit the treatment of diabetes and associated complications.  In addition, beta-glucans also promote wound healing and alleviate ischemic heart injury."  The complete study can be read at the PubMed website and link http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced: PMCID:PMC2663451.  (Note: The beta glucan used in the reported research was not provided by Nutritional Scientific Corporation (NSC), nor does NSC claim any of the findings of the research for NSC products)
03/01/15: 8:32 am EST: PERTUSSIS OR WHOOPING COUGH IN NATIONWIDE OUTBREAK IN 2015 WITH ONE DEATH
Pertusis, as well as measles, is breaking out across the U.S. and especially in California, Minnesota and Washington.  In 2015 California has reported 741 cases as of 2/12/15 with one infant death reported.  Minnesota has recorded 135 cases while Washington state had 97 cases through 2/21/15 compared to 16 cases in 2014.  Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis.  Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing that makes breathing difficult and is often referred to as whooping cough because of the whooping sounds due to deep breaths made during coughing fits with by those suffering from the disease.
02/27/15: 5:02 pm EST: LEWY BODIES DEMENTIA 2ND MOST FREQUENT FORM BEHIND ALZHEIMER DISEASE
You may not be familiar with Dementia with Lewy bodies but these tiny protein deposits in the cortex of the brain are now widely recognized as the second most common type of degenerative dementia after Alzheimer disease.  Dementia with Lewy bodies affects a person’s ability to reason and plan, concentrate, pay attention, remember and language abilities
Additionally, people with this form of dementia commonly experience visual hallucinations, which can be detailed and complex and can happen early on in the condition. They might also experience difficulty in judging distances, which can cause them to fall over for no apparent reason. it is quite common for people with a Lewy body dementia to experience extreme sleepiness and take long naps during the day. Recent research suggests that individuals may benefit from dementia medications called cholinesterase inhibitors.
02/16/15: 2:07 pm EST:  FLU CONTINUES AT EPIDEMIC LEVEL IN 2015
Epidemic influenza, especially the H3N2 mutated strain, continues in the United States in 2015 with the number of cases much higher than usual. The authorized flu shot this flu season is offering protection from flu of only 23% or less than 1 in 4 who take the shot, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC).  If you are 18 to 49 years old, the news is even worse because the current flu vaccine is only 12% effective.  The mutated H3N2 virus is an extremely virulent form of influenza. Tom Frieden, CDC Director, has stated this flu season is, "...a bad one, particularly for people 65 and older."
Forty-four states reported widespread flu activity, and 23 states and Puerto Rico reported high levels of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI).  Eleven children have died of flu in the United States in the past week, bringing total children deaths this flu season to 80.
02/09/15: 12:10 pm EST:  VACCINE DAMAGE CLAIMS AT $1.8 BILLION FROM NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT OF 1986
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, as amended established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (the "VICP" or "Program") (42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa-10 et seq.) as an alternative to traditional products liability involving the manufacturer as liable in any medical malpractice litigation for persons injured by their receipt of one or more standard childhood vaccines.  
Thus, if you have a legitimate vaccine claim, you must sue the U.S. Federal Government and the U.S. Government Vaccine Injury Program and not the vaccine Pharmaceutical manufacturer who is indemnified by the U.S. Government and immune from any vaccine damage liability claims.   
The lawyers against you in a vaccine damage claim are partially paid by you from income taxes you have paid since they are a part of the U.S. Federal Government's Civil Division, in the Office of Vaccine Litigation. Any claims you win are also paid by U.S. taxpayers and not the vaccine manufacturers who provided the vaccine causing damages. More than 2,319 people have been paid in excess of $1.8 billion (collectively) in vaccine damages since the Program's inception in 1988. Settlements equal an average of $776,197 per claim and 66.7 million annually.  Vaccines covered under the Program include those vaccines that alledgedly protect against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), polio, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella (chickenpox), Hemophilus influenzae type b, rotavirus, pneumococcal conjugate, trivalent influenza (seasonal flu), meningococcal conjugate and human papillomavirus.   
Individuals who seek damages from vaccine caused malfunctions from covered vaccines can file a claim against the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking compensation from the U.S. Vaccine Trust Fund because the vaccine maker has been granted immunity from liability by the U.S. Government.  Eligible vaccine damage claimants can recover compensation for vaccine injury-related medical and rehabilitative expenses, for pain and suffering and lost earnings.
02/06/15: 11:01 am EST: CDC REPORTS FOR 2013 HEROIN DEATHS SURGE 39%; COCAINE 12% AND OPIODS 1%
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in January 2015 released the CDC' Drug Overdose Mortality Data.  Drug overdose deaths due to #1 cause, prescription opiod drugs, showed a 1% increase for 2013; but disturbingly Heroin deaths increased a staggering 39% while overdose deaths from cocaine increased by 12%.
Prescription opiod painkillers are prescribed for pain management and work by reducing intensity of pain signals reaching the brain with areas of the brain that also control emotions.  Prescription opiods include but are not limited to Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet, Percodan, Demeral and Tylox; with prescriptions collectively for opiods rising an amazing 300% over the past 10 years.  In 2010 narcotic painkillers were prescribed in an amount sufficient to medicate every single adult, 24 hours a day for a month! 
02/05/15/: 8:56 pm EST:  02/28/15 Update: MEASLES CONTINUE TO SPREAD IN U.S. - 200+ CASES IN 19 STATES- 39 IN CANADA.  250,000 CASES WORLDWIDE WITH 145,000 DEATHS IN 2014
The recent measles outbreak at Disneyland now has resulted in 94 cases, with 203 total to date in 19 states.  Of those initially infected, 81% were unvaccinated and 19% partially or fully vaccinated. Note the unvaccinated included children too young before age 1 to be vaccinated and did not indicate whether any of the unvaccinated were recently distributed undocumented immigrant children (65,000+) previously without vaccinations placed in our schools nationally.  The CDC now indicates the original cases at Disneyland probably originated from persons attending Disneyland from out of the United States, but has not indicated to date whether vaccinated or unvaccinated. The more recent outbreaks in Chicago and other U.S. areas are still from undetermined sources.  In contrast, the Phillipines alone had 57,000 cases of measles with China having 100,000+ cases in 2014.  Worldwide there were 250,000 plus cases with 145,000 deaths from measles in 2014.
The International Medical Council on Vaccination reports in typical measles, a maculopapular (flat red) rash occurs first at the hairline, progresses caudally (directed toward the hind or tail), and is often accompanied by Koplik's spots (tiny white spots inside the mouth).  The infection is now also known to have been spread due to persons with measles, but before symptoms appeared, and in public locations including previously in California in physician clinics.The vaccine is a combination of a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) injection.  Controversy over the MMR vaccine continues with vaccine usage a personal decision after review of studies on the vaccine contents and physician consultation.
02/03/15: 7:44 am EST:  NEW YORK GOV'T ATTACKS "HERBAL CONCOCTIONS " FROM GNC, WALMART, TARGET AND WALGREENS
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has sent letters to GNC, Target, Walmart and Walgreens demanding the immediate stopping of selling of adulterated or mislabled herbal supplements private branded by the named stores.  The study on which the recall is issued is questioned by the herbal supplement industry, saying the new DNA evaluation technique used by New York state must be confirmed by Chromatography testing that is more definitive.  The testing was limited to only a few private label brands and did not evaluate any major name-brands of dietary and food supplements undistributed through the four named companies. Although, as is usual, efforts in the pharmaceutical supported media have attempted to smear the entire dietary supplement industry not implicated by these questionable testing procedures in New York state, a major pharmaceutical dominated state.
01/20/15 - 8:33 am EST:  DEMENTIA "LINKED" TO PRESCRIPTION AND OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUGS
A study from the U. of Washington of 3,434 people aged 65 and older has linked long-term usage of drugs including Tricyclic antidepressants; Antihistamines used to treat hay-fever and allergies; and Antimuscarinics for treating urinary incontinence, both prescription and over-the-counter, to dementia.  All of the studied drugs have an "anticholinergic" effect.  An anticholinergic agent is a substance that blocks the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous system.  
Leaflets accompanying the drugs studied already warn of the possibility of memory and attention span issues, plus dry mouth; but now a higher risk of dementia also appears present. Experts without explanation stated people taking the substances should not panic or stop taking the medicines studied. In particular, the study concluded people taking at minimum 10 mg/day of doxepin (antidepressant), 4 mg/day of diphenhydramine (sleep aid) or 5 mg/day of oxybutynin (urinary incontenance drug) for more than 3 years would be at greater risk for developing dementia.
01/16/15 - 6:45 am EST:  CDC REVEALS 2014 FLU VACCINE ONLY 23% EFFECTIVE - LESS THAN 1 IN 4 PROTECTED BY THE FLU SHOT.  ONLY 12% PREVENTION FOR 18-49 AGE GROUP OR 1 IN 8!
The epidemic influenza level for 2014-15 is higher than norm in the U.S. primarily due to a flu shot that this flu season is offering protection from flu to 23% or less than 1 in 4 who take the shot, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC).  If you are 18 to 49 years old, the news is even worse because the current flu vaccine is only 12% effective.  The mutated H3N2 virus is an exstremely virulent form of influenza. Tom Frieden, CDC Director, has stated this flu season is, "...a bad one, particularly for people 65 and older." 
The statistic surprising many also given by the CDC discloses normal benefits of a flu shot are effective against influenza for only about 60% of those taking the shot annually.   If all 350 million Americans took the flu shot in a regular year, 140 million would not be protected by the highly touted flu vaccine! This year only about 80 million would be protected.   http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm .
What do 140 million folks do for which the flu shot has not worked?  Wash hands frequently, avoid sugar laden products while eating a healthy diet, get moderate exercise, adequate sleep, minimize stress and nutritionally supplement with immune enhancers including a good multiple vitamin and mineral product including vitamin C, together with respiratory related nutritional supplements and the immune response normalizer, MG beta 1,3/1,6 glucan.
01/10/15 - 6:25 pm EST: CDC INVESTIGATING RECENT OUTBREAK OF SEVERE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS TRACED TO ENTEROVIRUS D68 (EV-D68).
The CDC and state public health laboratories have confirmed 1,153 cases of EV-D68, almost exclusively in children about 7 years old with many hospitalized, including 13 deaths from August to January 8, 2015. The EV-D68 virus is related to the paralyzing polio virus.  There is concern millions of Americans may have contracted mild EV-D68 infections that were untreated and untested.
01/09/15 - 9:48 am EST: CDC REPORTS INFLUENZA AT EPIDEMIC LEVELS IN UNITED STATES WITH 26 CHILDREN DEAD
Tom Frieden, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has announced the U.S. is now at epidemic levels of influenza this flu season. The proportion of deaths from influenza and pneumnia surpassed the "epidemic" threshold set by the CDC with 26 child related deaths reported to date. "Even in a good year, the flu caccine is not as effective as our other vaccines," Frieden says, noting that flu efficacy rates are about 60% to 65%. 
The CDC flu report also reveals the rate of flu-related hospitalizations is far in excess of norms for this period of the flu season. The proportion of out-patient visits for influenza-like illness was 5.5% or more than double the national baseline of 2.0%, with all regions of the U.S. reporting high levels of inflenza.  The primary reason for the high level of dangerous A H3N2 flu, is the mutated strain most virulent is not contained in the 2014-15 flu shots.  The CDC has warned that the mutated H3N2 strain circulating and not included in the current flu shot is linked to an influenza illness that is more severe than usual and twice as many  hospitalizations as normal.
12/23/14 - 3:57 pm EST: FDA WARNING AGAINST PURE POWDERED CAFFEINE - FATAL EVEN IN SMALL DOSES
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns consumers to avoid pure powdered caffeine because even a teaspoon of the pure caffeine powder can be lethal, equivalent to 25 cups of coffee.  The energy boost has made the pure caffeine powder, still available on the internet, popular with teens and young adults, but the FDA says people may not realize the powdered form is a pure chemical with the difference between a safe amount and lethal dose very small.  FDA legal action is planned against manufacturers to cease marketing.  Symptoms of caffeine overdose or toxicity include rapid or erratic heartbeat, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea and disorientation.  At minimum one teen death to date has been caused by consuming a lethal dose of pure powdered caffeine.
12/19/14 - 11:53 am EST: $373 MILLION IN MEDICARE PAYMENT PENALTIES FOR U.S. HOSPITALS WITH HIGHEST INFECTION & INJURY RATES DUE TO MEDICAL ERRORS - 1 IN 7 U.S. HOSPITALS
Obamacare mandates reductions in the form of penalties for the 25% of U.S. hospitals having the hightest rates of "hospital-acquired conditions,"  including infections from catheters, blood clots, bed sores and other complications considered avoidable.  Included in the 721 U.S. hospitals penalized for excessive medical errors were the renowned Cleveland Clinic and Women's Hospital in Boston. A recent Federal report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality did find frequency of medical errors nationally declined 17% between 2010 and 2013. Suggested areas for improvement are computerized versus handwritten physician instructions, better hand hygiene and checklists on procedures to follow during surgeries.
12/18/14 - 5:23 PM EST: 11TH DOCTOR DIES IN SIERRA LEONE PLUS 350 HEALTH WORKERS
Dr. Victor Willoughby, a senior physician in Sierra Leone, has died of Ebola HF.  Dr. Willoughby's death brings to 11 the number of physicians having died in this nation, together with 350+ healthcare workers in the region.  6,900 have now died in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.  In more bad area news, a warehouse full of critical medical supplies for fighting Ebola in Guinea was destroyed in an airport area fire.  While Ebola HF is declining in Guinea and Liberia at present, Sierra Leone continues increasing in epidemic rates in cases of Ebola HF.
12/16/14 - 4:53 pm EST: FEDERAL AGENTS ARREST OWNERS OF NEW ENGLAND COMPOUNDING CENTER INVOLVED IN FUNGAL MININGITIS OUTBREAK LEADING TO DEATHS OF 64 PERSONS
Barry Cadden, president and owner, Greg Conigliaro, of New England Compounding Center (NECC) were taken into custody by Federal agents.  According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), NECC produced the steroids linked to a fungal miningitis outbreak leading to the death of 64 persons and sickening of an additional 750.
12/14/14 - 11:56 AM EST: MALARIA KILLED 584,000 WORLDWIDE IN 2013 WITH 20,000 IN WEST AFRICA
While Ebola HF to date in 2014 has killed an estimated 6,800 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone; 20,000 deaths were attributed to Malaria in 2013 with 6.6 million cases estimated. According to Pedro Alonso, in charge of the Global Malaria Program for WHO, most clinics in West Africa that are not treating Ebola are closed with residents of the 3 countries in fear of contracting Ebola HF in area clinics.  A result is malaria cases are not being treated adequately and the situation is worsening.  The global mortality rate for malaria decreased 47% from 2000 through 2013; a reduction of 54%.  Malaria killed an estimated 584,000 people worldwide in 2013, including 453,000 children younger than 5; many suffering from malnutrition and substandard immune responses.  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-09/malaria-2014-deaths-may-top-20-000-in-ebola-hit-nations.html
12/09/14 - 7:41 am EST:  CDC-2014 FLU VACCINE NO PROTECTION FROM MUTATED H3N2 FLU VIRUS - CDC: "RATE OF HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH CAN BE TWICE AS HIGH OR MORE." DEATH RATE AVG 24,000+ ANNUALLY; COULD GO TO 48,000 IN 2014-15 SEASON.
In 2014 to date the Influenza A viruses, classified as H3N2, have been verified in influenza patients in most U.S. states.  The 2014-15 influenza activity to date has been mild, primarily in Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Massachusetts, but multiple cases of the H3N2 virus strain are an ominous indicator the current flu vaccine content may not be effective in preventing flu for many in the 2014-15 flu season.  CDC Director, Tom Frieden, stated in a CDC media release, "We know that in seasons when H3 viruses predominate, we tend to have seasons that are worse flu years with more hospitalizations from flu and more deaths from influenza....The rate of hospitalization and death can be twice as high or more."  Frieden continued, "...we're concerned that protection from vaccination against drifted H3N2 viruses may be lower than we usually see. These changes can signal that the immune response provided by vaccination won't protect as well for these viruses." http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/t1204-flu-season.html . 
According to the CDC, "Testing has found that 52% of more than 1,100 H3N2 virus samples were found to be antigenetically different, or "drifted," from the H3N2 virus used in this year's flu vaccine." This translates that the flu viruses selected to establish antibodies in the human body from the 2014 flu vaccine will be much less effective because the most common flu virus for 2014-15 has mutated to a different flu form of H3N2, not present in the current flu shot. The absence of this H3N2 flu strain that has caused the 3 most virilent flu outbreaks this decade in this years flu shot means many more hospitalizations and deaths from flu this season than originally estimated at about 25,000. The CDC Director further stated, that to date this flu season, five children have died from flu and outbreaks have occurred in schools and nursing homes.   
CDC Director Frieden stated the current flu vaccine, "may have some effectiveness against the drifted [mutated] strain."  Suggested by the CDC Director were antiviral medications that need to be taken 2 days before flu symptoms occur and do not prevent, but may shorten the duration and severity of flu symptoms. According to the NY Times, "The earlier they [antivirals] are given in the illness, the better they work, and all they usually do is shorten the illness by one day." http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/health/cdc-warns-that-flu-season-may-be-more-deadly-than-usual.html?_r=0 . Persons most susceptible to serious flu complications are children under 2, adults 65 and older, people with chronic pulmonary and cardiovascular problems and those with neurological and immunosuppressant disorders.  Plus, pregnant and postpartum women, people under 19 on long-term aspirin therapy, American Indians, the morbidly obese and nursing home and chronic-care facility residents.
All persons with impaired or substandard immune responses are at enhanced risk for influenza and should exercise moderately, sleep adequately, eat healthy, wash hands frequently, cover coughs, avoid areas of potential exposure to the extent possible and stay home if infected. Additionally, persons should nutritionally supplement to normalize personal immune responses which in turn are the human body's natural defenses against all pathogens seeking to harm the body, including influenza. Suggested are Vitamin C, Zinc and MG Beta glucan taken as directed as nutritional aids that nutritionally help contribute to immune response enhancement and normalization.
12/03/14 - 5:30 pm EST:  MEN WHO RECOVER FROM EBOLA SHOULD REFRAIN 3 MONTHS FROM SEX - SEMEN FOR 90 DAYS CAN STILL CARRY EBOLA VIRUS
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced men who recover from Ebola should abstain from sex for 90 days to minimize the risk of transmitting the virus by transfer of their semen.  Although the Ebola virus has been detected in male survivor's semen, there has not to date been a documented case of Ebola initiated through semen transferral.  Ebola has infected almost 16,000 people with 5,689 deaths to date.  In Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, where most cases and deaths have occurred in Western Africa, 600 new cases of Ebola HF were reported last week.
12/01/14 - 8:33 am EST:  FREE ELDERLY EYE EXAMS FOR CHECKING FOR DIABETIC EYE DISEASES
Diabetes can bring additional diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy and make a diabetic more susceptible than most to Cataracts and Glaucoma.  Diabetics with Type 2 should get a dilated eye exam at the time of diagnosis and annually thereafter.  Annual eye exams for Type 1 diabetics should begin five years after initial diagnosis after review with your personal physician.
Seniors over 65 with a cost issue in receiving a needed eye exam, may qualify for EyeCare America's program with the Foundation of the American Academy of Opthamology that provides eye exams and care at no out-of-pocket cost for eligible seniors.  More than 1.8 million have accessed eye care services through the program with details at www.eyecareamerica.org.
11/20/14 - 11:30 am EST:  CERTAIN GRACO AND CENTURY BABY STROLLERS FOUND TO HAVE CHILDREN' FINGER AMPUTATION RISKS
Severe cuts or finger amputation risks are a problem on almost 5 million Graco and Century-brand baby strollers being recalled in the U.S., according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  Children's fingers can be pinched by the folding hinges on the stroller' sides.  4 fingertip amputations, 4 partial fingertip amputations and a finger laceration have been reported to date due to the stollers involved. 
Model names being recalled are Aspen, Breeze, Capri, Cirrus, Glider, Kite, LiteRider, Sierra, Solara, Sterling and TravelMate Model Strollers and Travel Systems with manufacture dates ranging from 8/1/2000 through 9/25/2014. For additional information, including about free stroller repair kits, contact Graco at 1-800-345-4109 from 8am-5pm M-F.
11/18/14 - 4:59 pm EST: NURSES SEEK OSHA REGULATIONS FOR EBOLA RELATED EQUIPMENT FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS
Registered nurses associated with the largest U.S. nurses union, National Nurses United, today sought better workplace protection against Ebola in new OSHA equipment regulations.  According to the Washington Times, "National Nurses United said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) should flex its authority by mandating every hospital in America to provide "optimal" protective gear against the deadly virus that has killed roughly 5,000 in West Africa and infected two of the Dallas nurses who treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who flew to Texas and later died from Ebola. ...  This includes full-body protective suits that cannot be peneetrated by blood or viruses, and powered air respirators with a full cowl or hood to protect the face, head and neck."
Smaller rural hospitals having limited financial resources with insufficient budget funds in already difficult financial times would have difficulty meeting such OSHA equipment requirements without 3rd party support.  Such rural hospitals would not in most instances have qualified isolation facilities for Ebola patiens and would probably be exempted if not offering Ebola treatment from both treatment and equipment requirements, should same be authorized by OSHA.  Read more: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/nurses-union-calls-osha-mandate-optimal-ebola-gear/#!#ixzz3JSbQNRWt 
11/17/14 - 2:06 pm EST: SURGEON DR. MARTIN SALIA DEAD FROM EBOLA AT NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER BIOCONTAINMENT UNIT
Dr. Martin Salia died at 4 am today, Monday, 11/17/14, after the surgeon contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone and, after being transported and admitted to the Nebraska Medical Center, Biocontainment Unit in critical condition on 11/15/14.  
11/14/14 - 6:45 pm EST:  COMMON COLDS SEASON RETURNS WITH UNSEASONAL FRIGID WEATHER NATIONWIDE.  PUBLISHED DOUBLE-BLIND STUDY FINDS BETA 1,3/1,6 D GLUCAN REDUCED COLD INFECTIONS BY 25%
The European Journal of Nutrition has published results of a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, multicentric clinical trial, in which 162 healthy participants received Beta 1,3/1,6 D Glucan or a placebo.  Study results and conclusions in the clinical trial abstract stated, "A properly functioning immune system is crucial to defend against invading pathogens, including common cold viruses. "...supplementation with insoulble...(1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan reduced the number of symptomatic common cold infections by 25% as compared to placebo."...
"Beta glucan significantly reduced sleep difficulties caused by cold episode as compared to placebo.".."During a cold episode, the virus comes in contact with receptors on epithelial cells of the respiratory tract which in turn triggers a cascade of innate and adaptive immune response mediated by the release of inflammatory cytokines." ..."The present study demonstrated that yeast beta-glucan preparation increased the body's potential to defend against invading pathogens." 
To minimize cold exposure, wash hands often for 20 seconds or more; don't touch eyes, nose or mouth with fingers and avoid contact with people exhibiting cold symptoms.  If you get a cold: stay home and avoid contact with others, disinfect counter surfaces, dispose of tissues in containers, drink more quality water and keep your immune response in good condition.
The clinical trials report titled,  "Yeast (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan helps to maintain the body's defense against pathogens: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentric study in healthy subjects"  was the result of a study compiled by researchers Annegret Auinger, Linda Riede, [...] and Joerg Gruenwald. The study abstract and entire article in the December 2013 issue of the European Journal of Nutrition are available for review on Pub Med with PMID 23340963.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23340963%5Buid%5D   
11/14/14 - 11:28 pm EST:  LAUNDRY DETERGENT PODS A HEALTH HAZARD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN - MISTAKEN FOR CANDY
Accidental poisoning from ingredients in colorful laundry detergent pods have occurred in more than 17,000 children under age 6, according to a recent study published in the journal, "Pediatrics."  Of those cases of accidental poisonings, 4.4% or about 750 children were hospitalized and 7.5%, or almost 1,300, experienced a "moderate or major medical outcome."  Although rare, at minimum one infant death has occurred attributed to the detergent pods. 
Children who ingest ingredients from the detergent in the pods can immediately go into respiratory distress with intense vomiting.  If a child accidentally has eye contact with pod ingredients, exposure can cause mild to severe irritation, or even temporary vision loss. 
NSC News has found just one of the many common pod ingredients is sodium alkybenzene sulfonate, a substance known to be a skin irritant that is also corrosive to eyes.  In response to concerns, in 2012 Proctor and Gamble changed pod detergent containers to have a double lock on the lids.
The CDC has recorded a significant increase in the reported accidents associated with detergent pods as the detergent pods have become more popular and sales increased for usage in cleansing clothes and dishes.  Storage is often under a counter area easily accessible to young children that should be child-proofed for safety.
11/17/14 Update - 7:26 am EST:  OBAMACARE OPEN ENROLLMENT BEGINS 11/15/14 FOR YEAR 2015
HHS Secretary, Sylvia Matthews Burwell, has announced the website www.healthcare.gov will open for Obamacare enrollment on 11/15/14 and encourages sign-up during the sign-up period.  Secretary Burwell commented about the website, so troubled in 2014, "We will have things that won't go right. We will have outages, we will have down time...Something will happen. What we need is to be transparent, be fast and get it  fixed."  Original government estimates of 13 million signups for 2015 has been reduced to 9.9 million for subsidized private coverage. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has declared the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is a tax, although denied by the President and Administration spokes persons repeatedly.  At this time the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider a challenge to the subsidies in the next Court session.  If decided that Federal Exchanges cannot grant subsidies because the law is explicit in allowing only state exchanges to grant subsidies, about 50% of the 7.3 million Americans who have received subsidies from Federal Exchanges would  be disallowed from receiving a subsidy.  The Affordable Care Act law has been declared valid on this question in one federal appeals court based on probable intent and invalid in another federal appeals court stating the wording is unabiguous.  The IRS has issued a finding based on undisclosed authority to interpret the law that the Affordable Care Act subsidies are valid on all exchanges, federal and state, due to probable intent in spite of the actual limited wording.  The IRS position will eventually be governed by the U.S. Supreme Court ultimate decision on the issue.
Jonathan Gruber, MIT Professor who has been paid at minimum $4.3 million by the federal and state governments, including the U.S. Justice Dept., and who is the man described as the "Obamacare Architect" because of his personal statements as to  involvement in drafting the bill, has been recorded on a recently discovered video from his presence in a panel discussion on 10/17/13 at the University of Pennsylvania, Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, stating bill draft language was "tortured" to attempt to prevent reviewers, including the Congressional Budget Office, U.S. Senators and U.S. Representatives, from treating the bill as a tax and realizing the true cost, because if the bill had been transparent in informing Senators of being a tax and it's real cost, it would, according to Professor Gruber, not have passed into law. 
Further, Gruber pontificated, if difficult to understand and non-transparent, the stupidity of the American public and CBO would prevent realization it was in fact a tax. The President repeatedly stated Obamacare was not a tax in his speeches and TV interviews.  The Gruber statement represented an admission from his perspective the Administration knowingly misrepresented facts about the bill, knowing from inception it was a tax, based on the philosophy the "ends justified the means."  Other statements such as, "You can keep your doctor, period" and "You can keep your present policy if you want," were also misrepresentations made by many, including the President,  according to Gruber, to gain passage of the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare. Watch and hear the unedited video of Jonathan Gruber's admissions at http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/11/obamacare-architect-voter-stupidity-prompted-cost-concealing/?intcmp=trending .  The President has stated from Brisbane, Australia, that Gruber was not on his staff, he does not share Gruber's opinion of voters and Obamacare was completely transparent and thoroughly debated prior to passage.
11/10/14 - 6:55 pm EST: 18,000 NURSES TO STRIKE OVER PERCEIVED HOSPITAL READINESS FOR  EBOLA PATIENTS
On Tuesday, 11/11/14, a 2 day nurses strike will begin due to perceived lack of readiness for Ebola patients treatment in 21 Kaiser Permanente Hospitals and 65 clinics in Northern California. National Nurses United (NNU) will hold related  "days of action" in 16 states on 11/12/14 while representing 85% of nurses feel unprepared for Ebola.
Kaiser states Kaiser' staff is trained based on following CDC treatment recommendations; blaming NNU union leadership for any lack of preparedness.  A Kaiser spokesman stated, "We have repeatedly asked [them] to work with us on our Ebola strategy. They have refused."  The NNU contract expired in April of 2014 with renewal negotiations stalled over issues involving patient care.
11/15/14 Update - 8:15 am EST:  EBOLA INCREASES RAPIDLY IN SIERRA LEONE WHILE QUARANTINE LIFTED IN LIBERIA.  AS OF 11/11/14 14,383 EBOLA CASES WITH 5,165 DEAD IN WEST AFRICA
USA Today is reporting Sierra Leone has had an alarming increase in new Ebola cases, with 435 confirmed in the past week.  Almost 24% of the Ebola Cases in Sierra Leone have been reported in the most recent three weeks.  In Liberia the quarantine status has been removed by the Liberian government.  In Guinea, where the outbreak started, the cases according to WHO "remains intense.  No new cases of Ebola have been reported in the United States this past week and all Ebola quarantined persons in the U.S. has been released..
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports Africa has only 22% of the hospital beds needed to treat patients in that area.  Also, only about 50% of Ebola patients are being isolated appropriately to prevent Ebola spread with just 27% of the burial teams needed to stop the Ebola spread trained and in place.
11/03/14 - 7:10 pm EST: ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AF) ASSOCIATED WITH TWO-FOLD PLUS INCREASE IN ODDS FOR SILENT CEREBRAL INFARCTION (SCI) - A STROKE WITH NO OUTWARD SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS
The Annals of Internal Medicine has published a study in which researchers reviewed 11 studies involving the association between Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Silent Cerebral Infarction (SCI) or stroke.  Atrial Fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia that affects more than 2.7 in the U.S. who have up to 5 times greater risk for stroke and poorer post-stroke outcomes than those without Atrial Fibrillation.  In more negative news, Atrial Fibrillation also is associated with a 40% increase in the risk for cognitive impairment.  (Article: Association Between Atrial Fibrillation and Silent Cerebral Infarctions: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, S Kalantarian, et al)
10/29/14 - 10:17 am EST: U. S. STATE DEPT SHELVES PLANS FOR PRESENT TO BRING NON-AMERICAN EBOLA PATIENTS FROM OVERSEAS TO AMERICA FOR TREATMENT IN U. S. HEALTH FACILITIES
The Washington Times, in an article on Tuesday, October 28, 2014 stated, "The State Department has quietly made plans to bring Ebola-infected doctors and medical aides to the U.S. for treatment, according to an internal department document that argued the only way to get other countries to send medical teams to West Africa is to promise that the U.S. will be the world's medical backstop. 
Some countries 'are implicitly or explicitly waiting for medevac assurances' before they will agree to send their own medical teams to join U.S. and U.N. aid workers on the ground, the State Department argues in the undated four-page memo, which was reviewed by The Washington Times.
'The United States needs to show leadership and act as we are asking others to act by admitting certain non-citizens into the country for medical treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) during the Ebola crisis,' says the four-page memo, which lists as its author Robert Sorenson, deputy director of the office of international halth and biodefense.
A State Department official signaled Tuesday evening that the discussions had been shelved.  'There is no policy of the U.S. government to allow entry of non-U.S. citizen Ebola-infected to the United States. There is no consideration in the State Department of changing that policy,' the official said."

11/06/14 UPDATE - 6:20 pm EST: U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY ORDERS 21 DAY "CONTROLLED MONITORING" PERIOD FOR SOLDIERS POTENTIALLY EXPOSED IN EBOLA AREA OF WEST AFRICA - W H O ANNOUNCES 4,818 DEAD IN 8 COUNTRIES WITH 13,042 CASES OF EBOLA HF AS OF 11/02/14
U.S. Defense Secretary, Chuck Hagel,  has now ordered all U.S. military to go through a 21 day "controlled monitoring" period if having served in West Africa in an Ebola area.  Commander of the U.S. Army Africa, Major General Darryl A. Williams, is in a group of ten military personnel placed in "controlled monitoring" in the U.S. Military Installation in Vicenza, Italy for 21 days, after returning from West Africa.  "Controlled monitoring" would appear to be the definition of a quarantine, but Pentagon personnel refused to use the word "quarantine," possibly due to the Obama Administration's opposition to "quarantines" in the U.S. of returning Americans or those potentially exposed to Ebola in the West African nations. The American army personnel exhibited no symptoms of Ebola on arrival in Italy after having their plane met by Italian health authorities in protective equipment similar to that used by U.S. health care workers in handling potential and actual Ebola infected persons on arrival in the United States.
The World Health Organization has released an update that as of 11/02/14 there have been 4,818 deaths with 13,042 cases of Ebola HF in eight countries, including the United States.
10/28/14 - 5:06 am EST:  NY, NJ and ILCONTINUE 21 DAY QUARANTINE BUT ALLOW AT HOME FOR ARRIVALS WITH EBOLA POTENTIAL - NJ RELEASES FIRST QUARANTINEE EARLY!   NEW YORK CITY DOCTOR CONFIRMED WITH EBOLA HF AFTER DECLARED CLEAR ON ARRIVAL
Ebola HF virus is an extremely dangerous and highest level 4 biohazard meaning the Ebola HF virus with a 70% fatality rate causes severe fatal disease in humans and for which vaccines and other treatments are not available.   Ebola HF virus has the ability to rapidly mutate in response to attempts to control.  In contrast to government pronouncements that transfer is only by contact with Ebola infected body fluids, forms of Ebola virus have a history of being airborne in similar strains involving animals and potentially in the current strain in humans based on the newest scientific methods of airborne measurement.  USAMRIID virologists were fully aware as far back as 1990 that Ebola variants could become airborne and  (www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/commentary-health-workers-need-optimal-respiratory-protection-ebola)
Doctor, Craig Spencer, is in isolation in Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City in stable condition after being confirmed to have Ebola HF.  Dr. Spencer recently returned from treating patients in Guinea with Ebola and tested positive for the Ebola virus on Thursday, 10/23/14 after passing screening for Ebola on arrival in the United States.  A search for persons who had contact with Dr. Spencer after arrival is now ongoing, with his fiance now in isolation also for observation, but not diagnosed.  It is reported Dr. Spencer had gone bowling while taking a New York subway and taxi prior, supposedly, to becoming contagious after exhibiting Ebola symptoms.
New York, New Jersey and Illinois have partially yielded to Presidential pressure in allowing their 21 day quarantine to be at traveler's homes, including doctors and nurses who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa. While the quarantine 21 day period remains in effect, Kaci Hickox, the nurse quarantined in NJ after returning from West Africa and treating Ebola patients, has been released early prior to a 21 day period due to pressure from the CDC.  Hickox, a CDC employee, is now stating she will sue the state of New Jersey for her involuntary Ebola quarantine.  Almost no media resources have reported Hickox is associated with the CDC which, with the President and NIH, opposes the state quarantines  (http://gotnews.com/ebola-nurse-complaining-quarantine-left-wing-democrat-cdc-employee/ ) . 
Florida will still utilize a quarantine in isolation for observation for 21 days. The Obama administration is intensely insisting healthcare workers will be less likely to serve in Africa if the 21 day quarantine is implemented, while isolation proponents stated for public good, including the evidence by the New York doctor who showed no symptoms on arrival in the U.S. but now has Ebola, that isolation is warranted. States have the legal right to implement health quarantines in spite of federal opposition.  The Obama Administration believes voluntary individual quarantine will work although evidence in recent events, including the NY doctor with Ebola who went bowling and traveled on a NY subway, indicate otherwise.
In a Congressional Hearing on Ebola on 10/24/14, U.S. Representive John Mica from Florida commented he wanted to see more common sense demonstrated by government officials and suggested a quarantine.  Mica pointed out that the doctor [Dr. Craig Spencer] that recently contracted the disease in New York City had passsed through an airport without being detected by additional screening.  Representative Mica stated, "The testing at the airport isn't working, we need a quarantine in place - period - for those coming out of there [West Africa] or you're not going to stop this."  New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Florida quarantines were introduced by the States (not the federal government) after Representative Mica's statement.
In Ebola patient updates, nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson have been declared to be free of the Ebola virus by respective hospital personnel involved in their treatment
10/23/14 - 4:14 pm EST: CDC ADMITS DISEASE IMPORTED FROM 7,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AFTER UNLAWFUL ENTRY ACROSS U.S. SOUTHERN BORDER
As reported by the San Antonio Headlines Examiner on 10/22/14 in a report by Jack Dennis, "While analyzing hundreds of documents, articles and releases for this article, the Examiner discovered on Tuesday that the Center for Diseases Control (CDC) disclosed on a May 29, 2014 press release that, 'nearly all cases of measles this year have been associated with international travel by unvaccinated people.'  As thousands if illegal immigrants from South and Central America crossed over the U.S.-Mexico border, the CDC recognized that this was, 'the largest number of measles cases in the United States in the first five months of a year since 1994.' 
By the end of May, CDC also declared that 97 percent of the measles cases 'were associated with importations from at least 18 countries.  More than one in seven cases has led to hospitalization.'  From Jan. 1 to Oct. 11, 2014, the CDC announced that 599 confirmed cases of measles were reported with 18 outbreaks in 22 states. In 2013 and 2012 there were only 187 and 55 cases reported.
Hospitals throughout America are reporting record breaking numbers as their emergency rooms are overwhelmed beyond capacity.  Figures as of October 20, 2014 show the largest reported cases of these mystery illnesses included over 4,300 children at Children's Hospital Colorado. In just one day 540 children visited the Cincinati Children's Hospital and 340 cases were reported by a Mobile, Alabama children's hospital.  Medical labs testing confirm many of these cases are Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). Media reports show at least nine known deaths from EV-D68 in the U.S. in 2014."
The San Antonio Headline Examiner report continued, "Perhaps the White House doesn't want Americans to know that out of over 70,000 illegal immigrant children who crossed into the U.S. almost 48,000 came from Honduras, Guatemala and Salvador. In these countries measles and the EV-D68 virus are quite common. If we include these children's family and friends, not listed as 'unaccompanied,' over a quarter of a million people from Central and South America have entered the U.S. illegally this year [2014].  From 1970 to 2005 there were only 26 cases of EV-D68 ever reported in America.  The number in 2014 is approaching 1,000 cases in 40 states, with about 10% of those cases known to be causing a polio-type virus that has left 50 children with some degree of paralysis. 
Information from doctors, nurses, law enforcement and staff workers at immigration housing and transition facilities exposed enormous fears about the infectious diseases aliens were carrying as they process and care for them.  Thousands of these illegal children have been placed in public schools [throughout the United States], seen in hospitals, and are receiving medical care, without meeting normal immunization requirements that American children are expected to have. 
Dr. Jane Orient, Executive Director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, is especially concerned about the illegal immigrants from Central American children bringing these viruses into the U.S. ...'it only takes one infected child to infect the whole classroom,' Dr. Orient said.  The fact that the highest rates of TB in America are along the Mexican Border States is [also] hard to push as just coincidence... ."  ( http://www.examiner.com/article/cdc-admitted-disease-imported-as-states-data-reveals-illegal-immigrant-links )
10/22/14 - 8:24 am EST: WEST AFRICAN AIR PASSENGERS MUST ARRIVE IN U.S. IN ONE OF FIVE AIRPORTS FOR BASIC FEVER TESTING - NO PLAN BY U.S. GOVERNMENT TO MONITOR AFRICANS ENTERING U.S. ILLEGALLY ON SOUTHERN U.S. BORDER
The Guardian newspaper is reporting the Obama administration has invoked America's first Ebola-related restrictions, requiring airline passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to submit to basic tests for fever and questioning on possible Ebola HF exposure prior to departure from their site of original flight.  There are now no direct flights from these three countries into the U.S. 
White House officials insisted U.S. policy against wider travel restrictions was not shifting.  "Our views on the travel ban have not changed," said spokesman Josh Earnest. "The president has reached the conclusion, with the help of expert advisers, that a travel ban would only serve to put the American public at greater risk." (http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/21/us-limited-ebola-travel-restrictions-west-africa).  How a travel ban into the U.S. on those from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea would create a greater risk to the American Public of Ebola HF exposure was not explained.
A poll released 10/21/14 by ABC News/Washington Post found 67% surveyed in the U.S. favor a travel ban on travelers coming to the U.S. from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea while only 29% oppose such a ban. (www.washingtonpost.com/politics/polling).  Many in the U.S. Congress, Republicans and Democrats, have also expressed support for a temporary travel ban from the three West African nations, including the Republican Doctor's Caucus comprised of 16 members of the U.S. Congress which on 10/21/14 sent a letter to President Obama requesting a temporary travel ban on travelers coming to the U.S. from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea.
Five U.S. airports - New York's JFK, Newark, Dulles, Atlanta and Chicago - now have the additional Ebola screening protocols in place, which are designed to supplement exit screenings in the three countries.  Not all persons exposed to Ebola will have fever in early stages of exposure since the incubation period for Ebola iis 2-21 days.  While persons in flight might not be exposed if an Ebola carrier is not exhibiting fever, if Ebola does develop after landing in the U.S. and symptoms appear after that time, those in contact with body fluids from someone with Ebola would be subject to contracting the Ebola virus. 
Of note, Thomas Duncan, who flew into Dallas, TX from an itinerary originating in Liberia, had given false information, believed intentionally, to Liberian authorities that he had not been exposed to Ebola, when in fact he had carried an Ebola victim shortly before his flights into her home only hours before she died.  There is fear persons aware they are exposed to Ebola in the West African nations will seek treatment in the U.S. unavailable in their nations by falsifying their exposure prior to flying to the U.S. and arriving before symptoms begin during the 2-21 day incubation period.
Also, Fox 5 San Diego, California is reporting the federal government has confirmed six percent of the people from Africa who enter the U.S. do so illegally through the southern border.  But apparantly the U.S. government has no plan to monitor such people from Ebola countries who enter illegally and might be bringing Ebola virus with them. (http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/10/21/U-S-Border-Agent-We-Are-Not-Ready-For-Ebola )
10/21/14 - 6:09 pm EST: CDC TIGHTENS PREVIOUS INFECTION CONTROL GUIDANCE FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS - MULTIPLE PERSONS IN OBSERVATEION RELEASED AFTER 21 DAYS WITHOUT EBOLA SYMPTOMS
More than 42 persons have been released from observation status for Ebola HF symptoms and no new cases have been confirmed in 6 days in positive announcements relating to Ebola HF in the United States. The CDC is also tightening previous infection control guidance for healthcare workers caring for patients with Ebola; focusing on specific personal protective equipment (PPE).  Nurses involved in such healthcare with Ebola patients have complained personally and through national nurse organizations that training, equipment and applicable hospital supplies, including the process of putting on and taking off the equipment, have been lacking and inadequate.  Two nurses having treated an Ebola victim that has died have since contracted the disease and are now in isolation treatment. 
Natural News reports on 10/21/14, "As long as the U.S. southern border remains unprotected and air traffic from Ebola outbreak nations is allowed to freely enter the United States, we are almost certain to see additional cases of Ebola appearing in U.S. hospitals in the months ahead. Natural News has also uncovered proof that USAMRIID virologists were fully aware as far back as 1990 that Ebola variants could become airborne, spreading like influenza through air ducts that infected and killed hundreds of primates in U.S. Army laboratories." ( http://www.naturalnews.com/047344_Ebola_outbreak_containment_pandemic_preparedness.html )
The CDC stated 3 principles are essential for those treating Ebola HF patients, including (1) rigorous and repeated training in proper preparation and treatment ; (2) no skin exposure when personal protection equipment (PPE) is worn and (3) trained monitors to actively observe workers with PPE and to supervise each worker during the wearing and removal of PPE.  Most hospitals, already under financial strain from new requirements and limitations on reimbursements under the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and Medicare, are lacking present funding and personnel to fully implement and sustain the new CDC principles.

To coordinate United States efforts in combating the Ebola HF virus, President Barak Obama has appointed Ron Klaim, attorney from Washington D.C. on 10/17/14 as National Ebola Response Coordinator many call Ebola Czar.  Klaim is neither a physician nor health care expert, but has formerly served in prominent Democratic political positions as Chief of Staff for  Vice President Joe Biden and an attorney for Vice President Al Gore.  Ron Klaim is reputedly a legal expert in policy matters, but not in administration with no education, experience or training in managing and coordinating health matters or disease crisis.  Klaim, since his appointment, has been absent from the two recent meetings U. S. President Obama has chaired discussing Ebola and will not be attending the next Congressional hearing on Ebola on 10/24/14 .
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported Ebola virus is most prevalent in West Africa in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone with as of 10/17/14   4,546 deaths and 9,191 registered cases in West Africa alone, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  A second group of countries have now reported Ebola cases, including the United States (1 death to date), Spain, NIgeria and Senegal; with worldwide stats including these nations now 4,555 deaths and 9,216 confirmed cases with WHO predicting much higher levels in deaths and cases in coming months. The highest-level 1, CDC alert remains in effect in the United States in response to the Ebola HF crisis.   
In spite of a public and political outcry for stopping of flights from West Africa into the United States that might further infect U.S. residents until the Ebola epidemic is controlled, U. S. President Barak Obama has refused to issue the required government order. The President stated on 10/18/14 in his weekly radio show, "We can't just cut ourselves off from West Africa, where this disease is raging. ...Trying to seal off an entire region of the world - if that were even possible - could actually make the situation worse.  ... Before this is over, we may see more isolated cases here in America." 
According to WHO, "The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected animals or people."  Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, fever, external and internal bleeding.  In Ebola HF virus, immune cells in the human body are challenged with the destruction of the Ebola virus, but the immune system, especially when subpar, is hindered by the virus that destroys the immune cells abiliity to produce antibodies and the body to prevent blood clotting in response to the disease. The President, CDC, NIH and most physcians also to date maintain Ebola HF transmission is only by direct fluid contact. 
However, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota has advised the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) that, "there is scientific and epidemiologic evidence that Ebola virus has the potential to be transmitted via infectious aerosol particles," including exhaled breath containing airborne particles that in Ebola virus can remain viable up to 90 minutes ( www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/commentary-health-workers-need-optimal-respiratory-protection-ebola . Also see 10/17/14 NSC News on CIDRAP ADVISES CDC) .  The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) since 2001 has been a global leader in addressing public health preparedness regarding emerging infectious diseases and bio-security responses. 
There are no vaccines or treatments for Ebola virus to date approved by the FDA on a final basis. Suggested protocol for individuals is avoidance of the infected, frequent washing of hands, intake of quality water and maintenance of a strong immune system through nutrition, adequate rest, moderate exercise and medical school researche nutritional supplementation.
10/17/14 - 6:31 am EST:  AMBER VINSON HEALTH CARE WORKER CONTRACTS EBOLA - FLOWN TO EMORY UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA
Amber Vinson, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, is the second nurse who has tested positive for Ebola Virus, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services and is now in isolation in the hospital.  Vinson helped care for now deceased Thomas Eric Duncan who died 10/08/14 from Ebola in the hospital. Vinson is reported to live alone with no pets.  Amber Vinson classified as ill, but clinically stable, is now reported transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, GA. 
Amber Vinson had flown on Frontier Airlines flight number 1143 on 10/13/14 from Cleveland to Dallas-Fort Worth that landed Monday night at 8:16 pm CT. Vinson had reported having a low grade fever of 99.5 degrees before her initial flight on 10/10/14 and was given permission to fly by the CDC because her fever was below the CDC assumed threshold of 100.4 degrees for Ebola contraction. Vinson then reported a higher fever over 100.4 degrees on 10/14/14 after return from Cleveland, OH and was admitted into isolation at Texas Health Presbytrian Hospital in Dallas, Texas.
The woman, "exhibited no symptoms or sign of illness while on flight 1143, according to the crew," Frontier Airlines said in a public statement.  Earlier Vinson had flown from Dallas-Fort Worth to Cleveland on Frontier Flight 1142 on 10/10/14.  The CDC has asked all 132 passengers who were on board Flight 1143 on 10/13/14 to call a hotline: 1-800-232-4636.
CDC Director, Dr. Tom Frieden, in a public statement 10/15/14 has stated Amber Vinson, as a nurse who had treated a prior Ebola victim who died, should not have been allowed to fly on a commercial flight on 10/13/14 and such actions for those with exposure will be prevented in the future.  Although many have questioned why the borders are not closed and flights from West Africa and West Africans into the United States stopped by the federal government; President O'bama, the CDC and other Government Agencies have to date refused to take such actions which would demonstrate a national attempt to prevent entry into the U.S. by more Ebola infected persons from known Ebola epidemic status areas.
10/17/14 - 6:12 am EST:  CIDRAP ADVISES CDC AND WHO THAT EBOLA HAS POTENTIAL TO BE AEROSOL-TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASE, INCREASING RISK OF TRANSMISSION BY AIR
The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota has advised the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) that, "there is scientific and epidemiologic evidence that Ebola virus has the potential to be transmitted via infectious aerosol particles," including exhaled breath containing airborne particles that in Ebola virus can remain viable up to 90 minutes. ( www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/commentary-health-workers-need-optimal-respiratory-protection-ebola ) .  The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) since 2001 has been a global leader in addressing public health preparedness regarding emerging infectious diseases and bio-security responses. 
Although the Center for infectious Disease Research and Policy acknowledges that they were, "first skeptical that Ebola virus could be an aerosol-tranmissible disease" [airborne], they are, "now persuaded by a review of  experimental and epidemiologic data that this might be an important feature of disease transmission, particularly in healthcare settings." The President, CDC and other government health agencies, in addition to most physicians, to date in public hearings, protocols, and announcements have acknowledged a transmission path of solely direct contact and denied the possibility of airborne or aerosol transmission.
To quote from the CIDRAP Ebola commentary dated September 17, 2014 by Lisa M. Brosseau ScD and Rachael Jones PhD, "Medical and infection control professionals have relied for years on a paradigm for aerosol transmission of infectious diseases based on a very outmoded research and an overly simplistic interpretation of the data. ...Early aerobiologists were not able to measure small particles near an infectous person ...  In the 1940s and 50s, William F. Wells and other 'aerobiologists' employed now significantly out-of-date sampliing methods. ...
They concluded that organisms capable of aerosol transmission (termed 'airborne') can only do so at around 3 feet from the source.  Because they thought that only large particles would be present near the source, they believed people would be exposed only via large 'droplets' on their face, eyes, or nose. ...Modern research, using more sensitive instruments and analytic methods, has shown that aerosols emitted from the respiratory tract contain a wide distribution of particle sizes - including many that are small enough to be inhaled. 
Thus, both small and large particles will be present near an infectious person.  ...the important points are that virus-laden bodily fluids may be aerosolized and inhaled while a person is in proximity to an infectious person and that a wide range of particle sizes can be inhaled and deposited thoughout the respiratory tract." Quoting further from the CIDRAP commentary: "Some pathogens are limited in the cell type and location they infect. Influenza, for example, is generally restricted to respiratory epithelial cells, which explains why flu is primarily a respiratory infection and is most likely aerosol transmissible.  HIV infects T-helper cells in the lymphoid tissues and is primarily a bloodborne pathogen with low probability for transmission via aerosols. 
Ebola virus, on the other hand, is a broader-acting and more non-specific pathogen that can impede the proper functioning of macrophages and dendritic cells - immune response cells located in the epithelium. Epithelial tissues are found throughout the body, including in the respiratory tract.  Ebola prevents these cells [macrophages and dendritic immune cells] from carrying out their antiviral functions but does not interfere with the intitial inflammatory response, which attracts additional cells to the infection site.  The latter contribute to further dissemination of the virus and similar adverse consequences far beyond the initial infection site." 
The immune cells exposed to Ebola HF virus are prevented from creating essential antibodies needed to kill the virus, while the inflammation continues unabated throughout the body where the virus penetrates blood vessels and tissue, creating internal and external bleeding and fever.  By preventing blood clotting in the virus penetrated blood vessels and tissues, the Ebola HF virus can cause external hemorrhaging through blood droplets containing virus infected blood which then are potentially projected to animals and humans in the vicinity.
CIDRAP is warning surgical facemasks do not prevent transmission of Ebola, and healthcare professionals must immediately be outfitted with full-hooded protective gear and powered air-purifying respirators. CIDRAP's opinion on Ebola virus is there are "No proven pre- or post-exposure treatment modalities;" "A high case-fatality rate," and "Unclear modes of transmission." 
10/16/14 - 6:07 am EST: TEXAS NURSE NINA PHAM WHO CARED FOR EBOLA PATIENT, THOMAS ERIC DUNCAN, CONFIRMED WITH EBOLA VIRUS ACCORDING TO CDC AND THE TEXAS DEPT. OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES
Nurse, Nina Pham, who helped treat Thomas Eric Duncan during his second treatment occurence at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas, but prior to his death, has been confirmed to have an Ebola infection according to the CDC on Saturday, 10/11/14.  Pham is being transferred to the National Institute of Health facility in Washington DC on 10/16/14. The incident is the first transfer of the Ebola virus infection within the United States.  Dr. David Lakey, Commissioner of the Texas Dept. of State Health Services, has stated Nina Pham was not one of the 48 people who were identified as having had potential contact with Thomas Eric Duncan before his being placed in an isolation unit where he died on 10/8/14.  None of the 48 still being monitored who had contact with Duncan have to date shown signs of Ebola  infection.
Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC Director, stated the Ebola infection of Nina Pham who treated Duncan, contracted the disease due to a breach of protocol in treatment of Ebola patients, with the protocol breach, according to the CDC, yet to be identified although the female nurse was wearing protective gear.  The CDC does not monitor hospitals and has no authority to make sure hospitals in the U.S. comply with official guidelines. Each hospital in the United States enforces individual hospital infection control with standards that vary depending on funding and training time and facilities.  
Abbigail Tumpey, CDC Spokeswoman spearheading hospital education outreach stated, "There are 5,000 [5,723 actual] hospitals in the U.S. and I would say probably the number of them that have actually done drills or put plans in place is small." For many hospitals and health personnel, guideline posters and pamphlets have been the form of guidelines, although the CDC has announced several future training and guidelines symposiums for health professionals in the near future.  The decisions of whether to move or the process of moving a confirmed Ebola patient from one hospital to another are also under further review.
Full protection against Ebola is expensive involving special gowns, gloves, a mask and face shield. The putting on and taking off of the protective gear safely is a multistep, time-consuming, process with many steps needing training and drills.  One potential point of exposure is during glove removal if the wearer then touches the eyes or face. The federal government does not require hospitals to have an infection control specialist(s) and Medicare does not reimburse hospitals for hiring such staff many consider essential for proper training and standards enforcement.  
To date 85% of nurses surveyed reported their hospitals had not provided educational training sessions in which nurses could ask questions and interact in the sessions, according to a National Nurses United (NNU) survey of 1,900 nurses in 46 states and Washington DC in recent weeks.  76% of nurses surveyed by NNU responded their hospitals had not communicated any admission policy relating specifically to Ebola potential patients, while 37% believed their  hospitals had insufficient supplies for adequate response to an Ebola situation.  National Nurses United is the largest professional organization of U.S. registered nurses. Dr. David Lakey as Commisioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services said Dallas officials are investigating to understand how the virus was transmitted in the nurses case in Dallas, to improve health workers' procedures. 
10/12/14 - 2:45 pm EST: EV-D68 ENTEROVIRUS RESPIRATORY ILLNESS - 5 DEAD WITH 691 CONFIRMED CASES IN 46 STATES AND D.C., U.S.
http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks.html :  "The United States is currently experiencing a nationwide outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) associated with severe respiratory illness.  From mid-August to October 10, 2014, CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 691 people in 46 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68.  Of the specimens tested by the CDC lab, about half have tested positive for EV-D68. About one third have tested positive for an enterovirus or rhinovirus other than EV-D68.  Almost all the confirmed cases this year of EV-D68 infection have been among children. Many of the children had asthma or a history of wheezing.  EV-D68 has been detected in specimens from five patients who died and had samples submitted to the CDC for testing."  A national media doctor and epidemiologist has raised the question of any relationship between the 65,000 illegal immigrant children in recent months now relocated and in our schools in all continental states
10/11/14 - 10:45 am EST: EBOLA VIRUS NOW WITH 4,033 DEATHS AND 8,300 REGISTERED CASES IN WEST AFRICA
The Ebola virus is most prevalent in West Africa in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone with 4,033 deaths and 8,300 registered cases in West Africa alone, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  A second group of countries have now reported Ebola cases, including the United States (1 death to date), Spain, NIgeria and Senegal; with numerous other countries having suspected cases under investigation. The highest-level 1, CDC alert remains in effect in the United States in response to the Ebola HF crisis.   According to WHO, "The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected animals or people."  Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, fever and internal bleeding.  In Ebola HF virus, immune cells in the human body are challenged with the destruction of the Ebola virus, but the immune systems, especially when subpar, is hindered by the viurs in response to the disease.  There are no vaccines or treatments for Ebola virus to date approved by the FDA on a final basis. Suggested are avoidance of the infected, frequent washing of hands and maintenance of a strong immune system.
10/08/14 - 10:30 pm EST: THOMAS ERIC DUNCAN, FIRST EBOLA VICTIM DEAD IN UNITED STATES
Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, as the first person with Ebola in the U.S. has died.  Duncan had flown from Monrovia, Aftrica to Brussels, Belgium to Washington DC to Dallas, Texas to visit with his family, including his fiancee and son.  Duncan signed an exit form from Liberia, in which he represented he had no exposure to Ebola prior to his departure and hIs family still contends he was unaware.  Investigation has revealed Duncan prior to departure for the U.S. while in Monrovia, Africa, had carried his landlords' pregnant daughter into her home while she bled at the mouth.  The girl died the next day of Ebola virus, although Ebola as cause of death was denied by her family.
10/01/14 - 12:25 pm EST:  FIRST U.S. CASE OF EBOLA HF CONFIRMED BY THE CDC, WITH CRITICALLY ILL MALE EBOLA PATIENT NOW ISOLATED IN HOSPITAL IN DALLAS, TEXAS
The Center for Disease and Control (CDC) and local health authorities in Texas have confirmed a critically ill male patient in Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas has tested positive for Ebola HF.  The infected patient did not develop Ebola symptoms until four days after returning to the United States after departure from Monrovia, Liberia in West Africa on 9/19/14 and arrival in Dallas, TX on 9/20/14.
The unidentified male Ebola HF patient did not begin feeling ill with Ebola symptoms, including fever, until 9/24/14.  After examination, admission to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital into isolation occurred on Sunday, 9/28/14. The Liberian male patient came to the United States to visit family members and departed on a flight from Monrovia, Liberia to fly to Dallas, Texas.. 
Ebola HF is said to not be contagious until appearance of symptoms including fever and thus the CDC representative stated there is "zero risk" to anyone of contracting Ebola HF who traveled on the airline from Monrovia, Liberia to Dallas, Texas with the patient. The airline used from Brussels to the U.S. was United.  For details on Ebola HF including detailed disease information and development sequence, see also NSC News releases on the Ebola crisis from 9/30/14, 9/16/14, 9/09/14, 09/06/14, 8/28/14 and 8/11/14 below.
9/30/14 - 8:44 am EST: CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS SPREAD BY MOSQUITOS NOW WITH 1 MILLION+ CASES INCLUDING 1,125 IN THE U.S. IN 2014
An incredibly painful Chikungunya virus is spreading by infected mosquitos across the Americas with more than 1 million cases in the Caribbean, Central and South America.  In the United States there have been 1,125 case reported. in 2014, including 3 in Dallas County, Texas in September 2014.  Most cases to date in the U.S. have been brought back into the United States by travelers to heavily infected areas.  To date there is no known traeatment or vaccine with victims  given products and prescription drugs to help ease symptoms of severe pain and fever. 
The virus is seldom fatal but for primarily the elderly, can create on-going issues of chronic pain.  Technically, Chikungunya is an RNA virus belonging to the allpha virus genus of the family Togaviridae that was first reported in Tanzania in 1952.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported the Chikungunya virus in 40 countries to date located in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Those in areas of infected mosquito population should use DEET repellants as directed and clothing that covers exposed skin. Suspected cases should be reported to a physician immediately.
9/30/14 - 7:28 am EST:  3,091 NOW DEAD WITH 6,574 CASES.  HEALTH WORKERS NOW 375 CASES WITH 211 DEAD - NEW TREATMENT FACILITY FOR HEALTH WORKERS BEING CONSTRUCTED IN LIBERIA.
Healthcare workers involved with Ebola have themselves now contracted Ebola in 375 cases with 211 dead (Reuters).  A new 25 bed treatment center for healthcare workers is being constructed in Liberia to be staffed by 65 medical professionals.   U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in a new report issued 9/23/14 warned West African nations could become overwhelmed by the Ebola epidemic if up to 70% of Ebola patients are not in treatment centers or under professional care by late December 2014.  The worst case CDC scenario estimates without proper treatment in place and utilized forecast 550 thousand to 1.4 million cases of Ebola Virus victims could occur by mid-January 2015. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated 21,000 Ebola cases by November 1, 2014. 
Tom Frieden, CDC Director stated in a conference call to media, "A surge [of global support] now can break the back of the epidemic, but delay is extremely costly in terms of lives and effort. ...Even in dire scenarios, if we move fast enough, we can turn it around."  No reported Ebola virus cases are known to have originated in the United States to date (Two with one death now as of 10/13/14).  The immune system status of the great majority of  U.S. residents is vastly superior to those in Sub-Saharian Africa, together with much improved diets and significantly more health facilities to serve in case of emergencies; minimizing but not eliminating the threat of Ebola in the United States where a Level 1, the highest possible, health risk alert has been issued by the CDC and is in effect at present.
The death toll from Ebola HF in Western Africa has now passed 3,000 with 3,091 while Ebola cases are now estimated at 6,574 by WHO. The first of U.S. troops to assist in epidemic control are slowly beginning to function in Western Africa, together with 100 tons of medical supplies from the United States.  The epidemic has generated a worldwide response with the threat of expanding into areas other than Western Africa.  There are still no Ebola cases reported to have originated in the United States.  
While the Ebola HF situation is tragic, NSC News has reviewed other disease statistics and found Malaria in 2012 worldwide caused 627,000 deaths, with 200,900 of these in the Sub-Saharan Africa countires of Sierra Leone, Liberia , Guinea and Nigeria.  Nigeria alone had 180,000 deaths from Malaria in 2012, but the world response was tepid at best compared to the Ebola HF response. 
Tuberculosis (TB), both alone and in combination with the HIV virus, resulted in 2.3 million cases and 480,000 deaths in just Africa in 2012 (WHO) and 1.3 million deaths worldwide from 8.6 million cases of TB.  While the deaths related to Ebola  of 3,091 with 6,574 cases since March of 2014 are statistics of major concern, the 2012 reported deaths by the World Health Organization in African nations for Malaria and Tuberculosis of 680,900 (not a misprint) is both shocking and an indication of the devastated medical response systems of these West African nations in which citizens have widespread malnutrition and inadequate immune systems.
9/29/14 - 9:46 am EST: UPDATE - TUBERCULOSIS EXPOSURE NOW UPDATED TO 858 PATIENTS WITH FIVE INFANTS NOW CONFIRMED WITH TB IN EL PASO, TX
Providence Memorial Hospital (PMH) in El Paso, TX is reported by public health employees in El Paso, TX to have exposed to date 858 patients, primarily babies to Tuberculosis (TB), with five children now confirmed to have Tuberculosis.  The TB has been trasferred airborn from a hospital employee with active TB in the post-partum and newborn nursery areas of the  hospital between September 2013 and August 2014.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states TB is caused by a bacterium named Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is predominately located in the lungs, but can attack any location in the body including kidney, spine and brain. Tuberculosis is an airborn disease that can be fatal with 1.3 million deaths reported worldwide in 2012 from 8.6 million TB cases (WHO).
Tuberculosis is transmitted through the air from person to person when a person with TB in the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes or speaks and the nearby person breathes in the TB bacteria and becomes infected. Tuberculosis can remain inactive up to 30 years prior to becoming active. Those persons exposed in the El Paso hospital will each be screened to determine TB status after exposure, with collabortion of the local, state and CDC officials. Robert Resendes, Public Health Director of El Paso, Texas, sought to comfort parents and citizens by stating, "Infants who may happen to be infected with tuberculosis, cannot transmit that to anyone else - not to mom, not to siblings."
9/27/14 - 2:32 pm EST: ENTEROVIRUS D68 INFECTS 277, PRIMARILY CHILDREN IN 40 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Enterovirus D68 is reported to have hospitalized hundreds of children in 40 states and the District of Columbia, with 277 confirmed cases (CDC); many with severe respiratory challenges and several with potential paralysis having the virus in their bodies.  While Enteroviruses of more than 100 types are common this time of year, the distinguishing characteristic of Enterovirus D68 is the severity of respiratory issues.  The D68 Enterovirus form is particularly dangerous to immuno-compromised children and seniors, especially if a person is already susceptible to asthma or other respiratory health challenges.
Symptoms can include coughing, wheezing, rapid or labored breathing especially if involving neck muscles, not being able to catch one's breath, blue lips and for some but not all, a rash and/or fever.  Wheezing is common in asthmatics acquiring D68, with a respirator required for many in these situations. If a baby is unable to drink from a bottle in order to breathe, it is recommended to see a doctor.
The CDC states, "Non-polio enteroviruses are very common and can infect anyone.  Most people who get infected with these viruses do not get sick or  they only have mild illness, like the common cold.  But some people can have serious complications, especially infants and people with weakened immune systems.  There is no vaccine to protect you from non-polio enterovirus infections. Since many infected people do not have symptoms, it is difficult to prevent non-polio enteroviruses from spreading."
Enterovirus D68 can have serious complications as evidenced by more than 30 children being hospitalized recently in Kansas City, Missouri, with a reported 15% having been placed in intensive care.  No fatalities have been reported due to Enterovirus D68 to date. Recommended by the CDC is to wash hands with soap for at minimum 20 seconds.  Avoid touching and shaking hands, especially in social settings such as schools and offices.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.
Also suggested by many health professionals is the building up of the immune response while avoiding sugar and white refined products as foods that impair your immune response.  Get eight hours of sleep and moderate exercise.  Minimize stress, both personal and universal, as stress has a negative impact on your immune response.  Also suggested is nutritional supplementation with medical school researched immune cell enhancers that contribute to normalization and potentiation of the immune response.
9/16/14 - 6:08 pm EST: 3,000 MILITARY U.S. PERSONNEL ORDERED TO WEST AFRICA TO HELP FIGHT EBOLA BY PRESIDENT OBAMA
U.S. President Barack Obama has announced the sending of up to 3,000 U.S. military personnel to West Africa to help the overwhelmed health care systems of West Africa.  The United States through the Defense Department has requested almost $500 million in existing funds be reallocated toward training a goal of 500 healthcare workers a week, erecting 17 health care facilities with a targeted 100 beds each (Fox News) to serve as quarantine camps. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the death toll from Ebola HF now exceeds 2,500 with more than 5,000 infected with Ebola HF cases in West Africa.  While reported to not be transmitted airborne to date, the Ebola virus has now mutated more than 400 times in the most recent 24 days and, even if low probability, the mutation to become airborne would be a tremendous negative in containing the disease according to multiple members of the medical community.  Note, the scientific community does not classify projectile vomiting sending Ebola contaminated  fluids through the air to a second object or person as an airborne transfer, but only a fluids transfer.
The U.S. effort would further provide home health care kits to hundreds of thousands of West Africa area households.  A community-based campaign will also be implemented to train the area residents in how to care for exposed Ebola HF patients. The U.S. Military is to be utilized because of specialized knowledge in establishing quarantine camps.  The President stated the risk is low for Ebola HF to come to the United States but there is a risk both medically and security wise for the world and not just West Africa and thus a priority response is now essential for human health and welfare.
9/9/14 - 8:31 am EST:  EBOLA HF DEATHS AND CASES RAPIDLY INCREASE TO 2000+ DEATHS AND 3,600 CASES.   PRESIDENT OBAMA GIVES STATEMENT ON EBOLA STATUS
The Ebola HF epidemic in West Africa continues to rapidly increase in cases at 3,600, up from 3,069, in just weeks and in deaths an increase during the same period to 2,000+ (WHO), up from 1,552.  U.S. President Obama has stated a significant increase in U.S. assistance of $100 million and U.S. military involvement will be sought. AP has reported more than $600 million would be needed, according to those involved, in resolution of the Ebola outbreak. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected animals or people." Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, internal bleeding when the virus penetrates the blood vessels and tissue and fever. In Ebola HF virus, immune cells in the human body are challenged with the destruction of the Ebola virus that slows and hinders the immune response to the disease.  There are proposed treatments on fast track, but no vaccines or treatments for Ebola HF to date have been approved by the CDC on a final basis.
U. S. President Barack Obama, on Meet the Press on NBC last Sunday, 9/7/14, stated,  "We're going to have to get US military assets just to set up, for example, isolation units and equipment there [western Africa], to provide security for public health workers surging from around the world.  If we do that, then it's still going to be months before this problem is controllable in Africa.  If we don't make that effort now, and this spreads not just through Africa but to other parts of the world, there's the prospect then that the virus mutates.  It becomes more easily transmittable and then it could be a serious danger to the United States."
Tom Kenyon of the CDC said the keys to solving the outbreak will be isolating and treating the sick, monitoring their contacts for signs of disease and safely burying the dead.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued the highest level 1 CDC alert in response to the Ebola HF crisis in West Africa.       
9/6/14 - 8:22 am EST: WORLD AT PRESENT LOSING BATTLE AGAINST EBOLA HF ACCORDING TO U.N. BRIEFING
A missionary physician serving in Liberia has been diagnosed as positive for Ebola HF, according on 9/2/14 to the missionary organization SIM USA.  The unnamed doctor is the fourth physician from America to test positive for Ebola HF, while isolated at this time in the ELWA hospital in Monrovia, Liberia.  Missionary health provider, Nancy Writebol, and doctor, Kent Brantly, have previously been diagnosed with Ebola HF and returned to the U.S. for treatment, with both now recovered.  Previously, Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian American, fell ill and died of the disease in Nigeria.
The International Director of Doctors Without Borders, stated in a United Nations briefing on the disease status, "Leaders are failing to come to grips with this international threat. ...Six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it."  The Washington Post reported, "Separately, officials who are battling the outbreak in five African countries warned Tuesday morning [9/2/14] that the situation is reaching critical stage."
8/28/14 - 8:24 am EST:  BACK TO SCHOOL MARKS BEGINING OF COLD SEASON.  COLDS CAUSE 22+ MILLION LOST SCHOOL DAYS AND 276 MILLION LOST WORKDAYS ANNUALLY!
As most school-age children return to school, the togetherness increases the common cold occurences among the children, parents, kinfolk and millions more.   We have a tendency to dismiss having a cold as just something to be endured several times a year that isn't really a serious disease.   Not true.   In fact, over 62 million colds occur a year, causing more than 22 million lost school days in addition to 150 million of work days for those with colds and 126 million workdays for parents who stay home to treat family members with colds.  Estimates are 40% of time lost from work in the U.S. is due to the common cold, with 75 million+ physician visits a year in the U.S. costing 3+ billion dollars. 
Adults have 2-3 colds a year and 6-10 for children annually.  The common cold is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract.  Wash hands, don't touch the nose and eyes because the nose and eyes are the usual point of entry for the more than 100 different cold viruses. Eat a healthy diet, get adequate rest, moderately exercise and avoid those having cold symptoms.
In a PubMed (www.pubmed.gov) referenced study number 3762275, it was reported in publication, "Overall, the present study proved the safety and tolerability of an insoluble (1,3)-(1,6)-beta glucan preparation.  ...This indicates an improvement in the body's defense against pathogens. Notably, a reduction in common cold episodes of 20-25% was independently demonstrated ...for two different winter seasons, which underlines the robustness of the effect and biological relevance of the yeast (1,3)-(1,6 beta glucan preparation."  The published research involved 224 human subjects in a multi-cenetric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
Other health concerns are heightened in many areas this year where illegal immigrant children recently crossing our southern U.S. border are registering for admission to schools throughout the U.S., often claiming to be homeless without medical records or required immunizations, although to support staying in the U.S. they have claimed to be now staying with kin already in the United States.  Florida and Louisiana have announced areas being overwhelmed by the influx. Under federal law, the children cannot be asked if illegally in the U.S. 
Children of U.S. citizens entering the U.S. education system are not allowed to enter classes without documented immunization and medical records to protect the general welfare of the school population, but this requirement in many instances is being waived under federal edict for the illegal immigrant children newly arrived, even though tuberculosis and chicken pox have often been present in the detainment centers where the children are initially processed after illegal entry into the United States.
8/28/14 - 4:30 pm EST:  EBOLA HF DEATH TOLL INCREASES TO 1,552 WITH 3,069 CONFIRMED CASES - WHO STATES COULD EVENTUALLY BE IN EXCESS OF 20,000 CASES OF EBOLA HF
The World Health Organization (WHO) on 8/28/14 stated the Ebola HF outbreak in West Africa eventually could be in excess of 20,000 cases, or more than six times the current reported case level.  WHO also assumes actual cases may be 2 to 4 times higher than currently reported at 3,069 Ebola cases.  The death rate for Ebola during the current epidemic has averaged 52%, with up to 66% in some areas of West Africa. Past Ebola outbreak death rates have been as high as 90%. Through 8/27/14 reported deaths by the World Health Organization are 1,552 with 3,069 cases of Ebola.
Emory University medical personnel have announced 8/21/14 the release of Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol from Emory Hospital in Atlanta, GA, with both Dr. Brantly and Nancy Writebol pronounced by doctors as recovered and, "No public risk to health," on resuming private life.  Both Brantly and Writebol contracted the Ebola virus in Liberia, Africa while serving as medical missionaries.  The two Americans received the expirimental drug Zmapp during treatment, with Dr. Brantly also stating, "God saved my life." Dr. Brantly then thanked the millions worldwide who had prayed for his and Nancy Writebol's recoveries, while asking that those prayers continue for all suffering and threatened with the Ebola virus.
In Monrovia, Liberia,  an Ebola quarantine center has been attacked and looted by men who don't believe the Ebola HF epidemic is real.  3 patients were removed from the clinic by force on 8/16/14 by relatives and 17  patients suspected to be infected with Ebola fled into the the area during the attack, but are now back in an area hospital.  Now AP reports the Liberian Information Minister, Lewis Brown, has said the patients who fled have not yet been confirmed to have Ebola, but are now being tested.  The looters stole mattresses, bedding and medical supplies, suspected contaminated from the Ebola quarantine center. The patients activities while out of quarantine and the probable contaminated stolen supplies represent a serious potential  threat of expansion of the Ebola HF epidemic in the Monrovia, Liberia area.
The deadly Ebola HF virus epidemic continues to be limited in source locations to Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, with known tested cases in other locations proving negative to date.  However, the World Health Organization announced on 8/15/14 that, "Staff at the outbreak sites see evidence that the numbers of reported cases and deaths vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak."  The United Nations health agency stated WHO was prepared for the crisis to continue for months. Death and cases statistics are based on WHO data, in partnership with the Ministries of Health i Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.  
WHO on 8/12/14 endorsed use of experimental untested drugs to combat Ebola HF. The Liberian government has announced Liberia will receive at no cost the remainder of the current supply of the untested experimental drug, Zmapp, from Mapp Biopharmaceutical headquartered in San Diego, CA.  The experimental drug Zmapp is currently being administered to two U.S. citizens being treated at Emory Hospital in a special containment facility in GA, USA. (See NSC News 8/11/14 for details). 
The highest-level 1, CDC alert remains in effect in the United States in response to the Ebola HF crisis in West Africa.  As of this date, according to the CDC, there are still no known and confirmed Ebola HF cases found to have originated in the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on 8/09/14 that a preventative vaccine against the Ebola virus has been developed by British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, and could be available by 2015. Jean-Marie Okwo Bele, head of vaccines and immunization for WHO, stated on French radio, "And since this is an emergency, we can put emergency procedures in place...so that we can have a vaccine available by 2015."
On 8/8/14, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan declared a national emergency, following a declared state of emergency in Liberia on 8/6/14. For specifics on Ebola HF symptoms and characteristics, see the NSC News for 8/11/14.
8/11/14 - 11:39 am EST:  WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARES EBOLA HF CRISIS AN "INTERNATIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCY"  
On 8/8/14 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever epidemic in Africa as now an, "International Health Emergency."  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued the highest-level 1 CDC alert in response to the Ebola HF crisis in West Africa.
CDC Director, Tom Frieden MD MPH, on Thursday, 8/7/14 in a statement in a U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee hearing, reported the spread of Ebola to the USA is "inevitable" and will probably originate from international air travel (www.naturalnews.com). 
But, Dr. Frieden added he does not think there will be a "large Ebola outbreak" in the U.S.  Dr. Frieden on 8/06/14 said on Twitter, "Ops Center moved to Level 1 response to given the extension to Nigeria & potential to affect many lives." A CDC Level 1 alert means increased staff and resources of the CDC will be devoted to the Ebola outbreak, according to the CDC. The Level 1 alert is the first issued by the CDC since an alert in 2009 related to the H1N1 influenza pandemic.
The Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (Ebola HF) virus is fatal in 50-90% of cases.  Several suspected Ebola cases in the U.S. have been found negative for the Ebola HF virus and to date there are no confirmed and publicly announced U. S. sourced cases.  Better percautionary measures and facilities for treatment in the U.S., according to the CDC in earlier annoncements, are anticipated to minimize any significant Ebola HF threat in the United States. 
U.S. citizens, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, both infected with the Ebola virus in Africa, are quarantined in Emory Hospital as a CDC monitored facility in Atlanta, GA, to prevent spread of the disease during their further treatment in the U.S.  Both  have shown improvement after ongoing treatment with the experimental Zmapp treatment.  
Doctors at Emory hospital in GA treating the Ebola patients from Africa have indicated their present treatment program is primarily keeping a patient's body strong until body natural defenses can hopefully overcome the health challenge of the Ebola virus, while administering the experimental Zmapp, never tested for safety or effectiveness in humans. The experimental treatment (not a vaccine) known as Zmapp is made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego with funding from the U.S. government. Only extremely limited amounts of the Zmapp treatment exist to date, according to the manufacturer.
According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control (www.CDC.gov) on 8/06/14, "With the experimental Zmapp treatment the monoclonal antibodies bind to the virus, so that the human immune system can clear the virus."  The Wall Street Journal reported on 8/3/14, "But good supportive care, such as fluids to replace those lost in vomiting and diarrhea, medication to bring down fevers, and antibiotics for complications can improve a patient's chances by keeping the immune system as strong as possible to fight off the virus."  
Chief Operating Officer of WHO, Margaret Chan, reported, "...60 doctors, nurses and health care workers had now lost their lives trying to save others." A Nigerian nurse has also died of Ebola HF since the announcement.  According to WHO, "The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected animals or people." Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, internal bleeding when the virus penetrates blood vessels and tissue, external bleeding and fever.  In this form of Ebola virus, immune cells are challenged with the  destruction of the Ebola virus transferred by body fluids contact and droplets distributed by projectile vomiting of someone suffering from Ebola HF.  The ebola HF virus has an incubation period of 2 to 21 days.
If a person with active Ebola HF projectile vomits and/or due to hemorrhagic fever suffers external bleeding through orifices caused by Ebola virons preventing blood clotting after penetrating blood vessels and body tissue, the projected droplets and infected blood can transfer to nearby  humans or animals. This is especially a risk of exposure to those giving treatment or in airline travel involving those near persons with the Ebola virus exhibiting symptoms; particularly vomiting, external bleeding or excessive sweating.  Check with your airline if traveling in or to Africa for alerts regarding limitations on air travel.
Micronized beta 1,3/1,6 glucan has been demonstrated in U.S. Medical School animal testing to help contribute to nutritional normalization and potentiation of immune cells and the body's natural defense or immune system.   A strong immune system in the best condition possible is essential to avoid or hopefully able in time to overcome the Ebola virus after exposure.  To further enhance your immune response, eat a healthy diet avoiding sugar and white refined products.  Get adequate rest, moderate exercise, 8 glasses of quality water daily and minimize stress. Pray for both those exposed now in the world and for a cessation of the spread of this dangerous and deadly viral hemorrhagic fever.  
Watch for medical bulletins on Ebola HF from international, national and local health officials in your area for updates and updates at NSC News as this extremely serious health threat is now declared by WHO to be an international health emergency.  The Ebola HF virus is not yet known to be sourced in the U.S., but plan and prepare yourself and your family while being and staying informed.
Notify your personal healthcare provider immediately if you suspect personal or acquaintance exposure to the Ebola HF virus, or if experiencing symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, internal and/or external bleeding, together with flu-like symptoms.  Suggested to contribute to nutritional normalization of your immune cells is 10 mg of MG Beta Glucan in NSC-100 Extra Strength taken twice daily in the morning and evening. 
Note MG Beta Glucan does not prevent, treat or cure Ebola virus or any disease.  At present there is no approved FDA treatment or known cure for the Ebola virus. Check the CDC (www.CDC.gov)  and WHO (www.who.int) websites for updated Ebola information. Other health links, particularly the Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com), the British Broadcasting Corporation (www.bbc.com/news)  and Natural News ( www.naturalnews.com), also provide timely information on the Ebola crisis.
8/4/14 - 7:00 am: PUBLISHED RESEARCH  4/28/14 ON BETA 1,3/1,6 GLUCAN - SAFE AND IMMUNE STRENGTHENING

Immune-modulatory effects of dietary Yeast Beta-1,3/1,6-D-glucan.

Author information
Abstract
Beta-glucans are a heterogeneous group of natural polysaccharides mostly investigated for their immunological effects. …The effects mainly depend on the source and structure of the beta-glucans. In the meantime, several human clinical trials with dietary insoluble yeast beta-glucans have been performed. 
 
The results confirm the previous findings of in vivo studies. The results of all studies taken together clearly indicate that oral intake of insoluble yeast beta-glucans is safe and has an immune strengthening effect.

8/4/14 - 7:04 am - RESEARCH REPORT ON BETA GLUCAN BENEFITS TO SKIN
 Skin: Ber L., “The Skin Connection;” Natures Impact, Dec 1997. Quote: "The effect of a cosmetic regimen containing beta-1,3-glucan on the signs of aging in the skin was evaluated in 150 women, ages 35 to 60. A 27 percent improvement in skin hydration was observed after eight weeks of using the regimen twice a day. A measurable improvement in lines and wrinkles at the end of the study reached 47 percent, firmness and elasticity increased by 60 percent and skin color improved by 26 percent."
8/04/14 - 8:36 am - HARVARD RESEARCH FINDS BETA 1,3/1,6 GLUCAN FORM BETTER THAN CHEERIO’S OAT BETA GLUCAN FORM FOR HDL CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT
Cholesterol Control: Robert Nicolosi, Stacey J Bell, Bruce R Bistrian, Isaac Greenberg, R Armour Forse and George L Blackburn, "Cholesterol Benefits from Beta 1,3/1,6 Glucan Purified from Yeast Cell Wall," Nutrition and Infection Laboratory, Harvard Medical School; the Centers for the Study of Nutrition and Medicine and for Nutritional Research, and Clowes Surgical Metabolism Laboratory, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Vol. 70, No. 2, 208-212, August 1999. 
 
Quote:"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on serum lipids of a yeast-derived ß-glucan fiber in 15 free-living, obese, hypercholesterolemic men. ...The yeast-derived ß-glucan fiber significantly lowered total cholesterol concentrations and was well tolerated…The link between elevated plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations and the risk of developing coronary artery disease has been clearly established…Elevated plasma cholesterol and, in particular, LDL-cholesterol concentrations are associated with increased risk of coronaryartery disease, whereas an elevated of HDL-cholesterol concentrationis inversely correlated with the incidence of cardiovascular…The yeast-derived ß-glucan fiber lowered total cholesterol and raised HDL-cholesterol concentrations significantly. …
Unlike the significant increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations observed 4 wk after the end of the study for subjects receiving the yeast-derived ß-glucan, none of the 24 studies of oat products reported significant changes in HDL concentration. …Because higher HDL-cholesterol concentrations are associated with a reduced risk of developing coronary artery disease, there may be unique benefits of using the yeast-derived ß-glucan, and perhaps psyllium, rather than the oat products."  Note:The research utilized beta 1,3,glucan from a source other than NSC.
