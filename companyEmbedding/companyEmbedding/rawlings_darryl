Home> About us> EntrepreneurshipEntrepreneurshipInsideAbout usOur valuesOur global approachOur leadersGlobal reviewEntrepreneurshipEntrepreneur Of The YearOur people and cultureDiversity and inclusivenessOur historyOur awardsOur alumniOur Knowledge advantageCorporate responsibilityEY/Ethics hotline Share	Entrepreneurs make a difference. They not only have great ideas, but also the drive to make them a reality. They use their fresh thinking and hard work to create positive social change – bringing new concepts and products to market, and creating jobs and wealth.	We have long recognized the potential of entrepreneurs. Over the past three decades, we have been working with entrepreneurs, adapting our experience, industry capabilities and resources to work for entrepreneurial, fast-growth companies. We work with a range of businesses, from those receiving their first venture funding through to large mid-cap companies, whose value may be measured in billions of dollars.	Our commitment to entrepreneurial companies, in both emerging and developed economies around the world, helps ensure that we’re working with more of tomorrow’s global leaders, today. EY Entrepreneur Of The Year® –  celebrating entrepreneurs	We started the Entrepreneur Of The Year Awards program to celebrate successful entrepreneurs, so they could share their stories, inspire others and receive the recognition they deserve. Our first program took place in 1986 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States	By 1987 it was held across 11 US cities. And in 1993 the program started to expand internationally. Today the program spans more than 140 cities in 50 countries, which together represent more than 90% of the global economy.	Over the past five years, more than 6,500 entrepreneurs joined the Entrepreneur Of The Year alumni. A “who’s who” of both developed and emerging markets, these alumni include many household names. Over half of today’s top 100 NASDAQ companies have won Entrepreneur Of The Year, and most received the award before they achieved top 100 status.	Ten years ago we decided to go global and started World Entrepreneur Of The Year. Held annually in Monaco, Entrepreneur Of The Year country winners compete for the World Entrepreneur Of The Year title. Past winners include Michael Spencer of ICAP plc, Guy Laliberté of Cirque du Soleil and Narayana Murthy of Infosys Technologies.     Nature or nurture?	Entrepreneurs turn excellent ideas into successful businesses. But where does this capacity come from? We look into the mind of the entrepreneur.     Entrepreneurial insights We interviewed more than 40 of the world's leading entrepreneurs and captured their thought- provoking observations in this unique collection of video conversations.

Home> About us> Entrepreneurship> Entrepreneur Of The Year> Darryl RawlingsDarryl Rawlings Share 		Darryl Rawlings 		2015 Road to Palm Springs 		Darryl Rawlings never forgot his dog Mitzi, who was hit by a car and had to be euthanized because his parents couldn’t afford veterinary care. Darryl was just 14, but he vowed to someday find a solution that would spare other families that same painful choice.	   		  		CEO		Trupanion		Seattle, WA		Founded: 2000 		Years later, he sold a successful international cigar business and launched Trupanion, which provides medical insurance for cats and dogs across the US and Canada. Trupanion is the second-largest pet medical insurance provider in North America and the fastest-growing. In 2014, they became the first to go public. 		Darryl brought value and transparency to the industry. Other insurers limit payouts, but Trupanion created a product that pays 90% of the actual veterinary invoice with no payout limits. They use more than 1.2 million pricing categories that include more than 400 cat and dog breeds in 43,000 zip codes across North America to price their product. That lets Trupanion offer plans that cater to each pet’s needs. 		Darryl is a data-driven CEO. Monitors around the Seattle headquarters display real-time performance metrics for all employees to see. His long-term vision isn’t just to gain a few percentage points of penetration in the market. He’s aiming for 10-15%.

Darryl Rawlings
CEO

Darryl Rawlings is an animal lover and serial entrepreneur. As Trupanions CEO and founder, he brought transparency and value to the pet insurance business. His appreciation of the special relationship between pets, pet owners and veterinarians led him to invent a new kind of pet insurance. Trupanion insurance is designed to ensure that pet owners and veterinarians can make the best decisions about a pets health. It does not punish pet owners for making claims. It is the only pet insurance that has no limits. Trupanion is an industry leader in terms of its product, but also in terms of its organization. In order to provide high quality customer service, Darryl developed the concept of Territory Partners, who work closely with veterinarians and are vested in the long-term success of Trupanion. Everything about the company is designed to create long-term alignment between all stakeholders. Darryl was born in Vancouver, Canada, and studied business at BCIT. Before his launch as an entrepreneur, he worked as Director of Sales and Marketing at Telos Engineering, where he was responsible for cellular network sales in North and South America and Africa. Before that, he sold encryption technology to the cellular and military markets at Cycomm International. In 1994 he founded his first business, the Canadian Cigar Company. As an international importer of over 1,000 varieties of quality cigars, the Canadian Cigar Company served international cigar club proprietors, four-star hotels and bars, exclusive golf resorts, and retail stores. Darryl successfully grew the company and sold it in 1999. He used the proceeds from the sale to found Trupanion (as Vetinsurance, in Canada) in 1999. Between 1999 and 2005 Darryl refined his pet insurance product and business model in Canada. In 2004 the company became the first profitable North American pet health insurance provider, and a year later had grown by 4% per month for the previous twenty-four months, with the highest rates of retention and consumer satisfaction in the industry. In 2005, Darryl decided to expand into the United States and to become the first North American pet insurance provider to become licensed to do its own underwriting. In 2007, the company raised $22 million from Maveron (a leading VC fund specializing in consumer branded products), RenaissanceRe ($4 billion reinsurance company) and a large private equity group. The company was rebranded as Trupanion. In 2008, a Series B round followed. Darryl balances his time between building the worlds best pet insurance company and his wife Caroline and their two young sons, Sam and Bennett. Occasionally he gets in a day of boating.

Darryl Rawlings
CEO




The Trupanion team is headed up by Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Darryl Rawlings. Darryl is an animal lover who brought transparency and value to medical insurance for cats and dogs, driven by the mission “to help the pets we all love receive the best veterinary care.” His appreciation of the special relationship between pets, pet owners, and veterinarians led him to invent a new kind of medical insurance for cats and dogs. The Trupanion policy was designed in partnership with veterinarians to ensure that pet owners and veterinarians can make the best decisions about a pet’s health, so they can focus on the pet's recovery, not the pet owner’s finances.
In the Trupanion offices, Darryl is a progressive leader focused on transparency and employee fulfillment. He’s a very involved CEO who keeps a pulse on his employees, continually addressing challenges and driving change. In fact, his desk sits in the middle of one of the front lines of the business, the Contact Center, to ensure he stays grounded and in tune with employee and pet owner interests. Staying true to the passion that built Trupanion, Darryl encourages every employee to bring their pets to work and employs a Pet Director and professional dog walking service to ensure the pets are well taken care of while at the office. Subsequently, after experiencing the high cost of quality childcare in the US compared to Canada, he made a vow to employees to build a free onsite childcare center — a promise he kept in January 2015 when the doors opened. 
As Trupanion’s CEO for more than 15 years, Darryl is the longest-sitting CEO of a medical insurance company for pets in North America. Darryl strives to maintain a healthy work-life balance between building the world’s best provider of medical insurance for cats and dogs and spending time with his family. He married the love of his life, Caroline, in 2003 and they enjoy adventures with their two young sons, Sam and Bennett, their English Bulldog Tristen, cat Hallie, and parakeet Q. When Darryl is not in the office advocating for veterinarians, pet owners, and pets, he likes to spend as much time in the water with his family as he can — they can often be found enjoying the sunshine from their boat. Darryl is also passionate about surfing and, true to his Canadian roots, hockey.

“Trupanion has redefined Pet Insurance.”

Darryl Rawlings is pet owner and serial entrepreneur. As Trupanion’s CEO and founder, he brought transparency and value to the pet insurance business. His appreciation of the special relationship between pets, pet owners and veterinarians led him to invent a new kind of pet insurance.
Trupanion’s pet insurance offers cat and dog insurance in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Trupanion is self-underwritten by the American Pet Insurance Company, allowing Trupanion to offer a simple, customizable pet insurance policy with no payout limits and 90% coverage of veterinary bills. Enrolled pets receive lifetime coverage for diagnostic tests, surgeries, and medications if they get sick or are injured, with no incident, annual or lifetime limit.

MO: What inspired you to start Trupanion?
Darryl: In 1998, I saw a large gap between the penetration rate (level of acceptance) of pet insurance between North America and Europe. Europe was far ahead of North America in terms of pets insured. This was strange to me knowing how pet owners in North America feel about their pets, so it was obvious to me that we could do better.
MO: How did your experience and background help you develop Trupanion and ultimately lead to its success?
Darryl: I am a pet owner, so the idea of pet insurance was something I myself explored to protect my own pet. Having the consumer’s perspective was invaluable to me in developing a product that was cost effective but had the highest value on the market. This experience combined with the cooperation of the animal health community is what drove our vision and strategy.
MO: How challenging was it to put together and implement a corporate culture that really reflected your values and vision?
Darryl: Corporate culture is constantly evolving. It is something that needs to be nurtured and fostered continuously and we do that by listening to the needs of our team members and doing our best to meet those needs. For example, our team members enjoy the option to bring their pet to work and we have two full-time dog walkers available to keep the dogs happy and healthy. It makes our team members happy to be able to have their pets by their side and makes them that much more empathetic to our customers. Our company is centered on our promise to do what we say. It takes empowered, passionate people to live up to that promise.
MO: Where does your entrepreneurial spirit come from? Who or what were your early influences or inspirations?
Darryl: My goal in life has always been to be able to live a fulfilling and rewarding life. To do this, I needed to find a career that had a vision or cause that excited and inspired me. If I would have found that in an existing company, I would have applied. But instead, I was driven to start a company I could feel passionate about, and I still love what I do 13 years later.
MO: How often do you get feedback from the pet owners that you’ve helped? Do you have any success stories that illustrate how Trupanion is making a difference in the lives of pets and their owners?
Darryl: We receive positive, heartwarming stories every day from policyholders we have helped. The feedback is so inspiring and really reinforces our passion for the work we do. Pet owners have been able to save their pets’ lives; afford better, more effective treatment options; and keep their life savings or credit lines in tact – all because of our product. Here are a few examples:

MO: How does your business model allow you to cover 90% of actual veterinary costs for policy holders?
Darryl: Structurally we are simply more efficient than any other provider of pet insurance, as we have been able to decrease administrative costs and overhead as a percentage of premiums year over year. In addition, we have the highest value proposition in the industry, pricing all policyholders appropriately in like groups to ensure that pet owners with average pets will have at least 70 cents of every dollar they pay in premiums paid back in the way of claims over the life of their pet. And our goal is get that number to 80 cents.
