Videotron Centre
Quebecor is the manager of the Videotron Centre, a public arena in Québec City, until 2040. Construction of the state-of-the-art, 18,259-seat facility began in September 2012 and the venue opened in September 2015.It offers a diverse program of sports and cultural entertainment, including major events and shows featuring locally, nationally and internationally known performers. The Videotron Centre is also the home of the Remparts de Québec, a Québec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) team.
Gestev
Gestev is a dynamic event designer and organizer that has made a name for itself in Québec and internationally. Among other things, it is known for its high organization and production standards: it has injected a party-time component into every event, made them accessible to all, expanded their reach and implemented environmentally responsible management. The Snowboard Jamboree, Red Bull Crashed Ice, Vélirium cycling event, Sprint Québec, FINA Synchronised Swimming World Cup and Transat Québec Saint-Malo sailing race are just a few of the major events organized by Gestev.
Major junior hockey teams
Since 2011, the Armada de Blainville-Boisbriand hockey team has been owned by Quebecor, Joël Bouchard, Jean-Sébastien Giguère, Daniel Brière, Ian Laperrière and Pierre Gendron.The team has won the division championship and many individual and team trophies. It plays its home games at the Centre d'Excellence Sports Rousseau (CESR) on Grande-Allée Boulevard in Boisbriand.
The Remparts de Québec hockey team has been owned by Quebecor since 2014.Since the creation of the Remparts in 1969, hockey greats-to-be such as Maurice Filion, Guy Lafleur and Patrick Roy have played on the team. High points of the team’s history include the dream years during which the Remparts won the Memorial Cup in 1971 and the President’s Cup three times in the 1970s.In 2006, the Remparts won the Memorial Cup again. In 2006-2007 season, the team set a new league season attendance record, which it has since broken several times.

Our founder, Pierre Péladeau, believed that when life has been good to you, it is important to give something back.This principle is an integral part of Quebecor's corporate culture. Every year, Quebecor provides financial assistance to a large number of worthy causes  in the vital fields of health, community services, education, the environment and entrepreneurship. And Quebecor supports arts and culture in many ways.   
In 2007, Quebecor conceived and launched Éléphant: The memory of Québec cinema, a large-scale project to digitize in HD, restore and preserve Québec's heritage of feature films and make it accessible.More than 200 movies are now available 24/7 on Videotron’s illico video-on-demand service (channel 900), illico.tv and illico mobile. The films are also being gradually added, in the original version with subtitles, to iTunes in Canada, the U.S., France and all other European and African countries where French or English is one of the official languages. The Éléphant website at www.elephant.canoe.ca contains the largest existing database and information bank on Québec cinema.
In the arts, Quebecor supports many organizations and events such as SACEF’s Ma première Place des Arts contest, the Correspondances d'Eastman, Espace Félix-Leclerc, the Festival International de la poésie de Trois-Rivières and Montréal Museum Day.Quebecor has been the major partner of the Théâtre du Rideau Vert since 2005.
Quebecor publishes a yearly Bilan culturel. Click on the links below to access these reports detailing the activities of Quebecor and its subsidiaries in the cultural sphere and their contribution to promoting Québec arts and culture. Every year, the financial support and gifts in kind they provide add up to hundreds of millions of dollars.

(QBR.A)(QBR.B)(QI), Quebecor Media Inc. (QMI) and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDP) announced today that they have reached an agreement (the Agreement) regarding a partial sale of CDP''s 45.3% interest in QMI, with respect to which the parties have agreed on a value of $2.75 billion.The Agreement provides for the completion of the following two transactions:the repurchase by QMI of 20,351,307 shares of QMI held by CDP, representing approximately 36.4% of CDP''s interest before closing, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion, payable in cash; andthe purchase by QI of 10,175,653 shares of QMI held by CDP, representing approximately 18.2% of CDP''s interest before closing, in consideration of the issuance to an affiliate of CDP of $500 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures of QI, which are convertible into QI Class B Subordinate Shares (the Convertible Debentures). Upon completion of these transactions, which is currently expected on or around October 11, 2012 (subject to a financing condition in favour of QMI and customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals), CDP will hold 25,439,134 shares of QMI, representing a 24.6% interest in QMI (excluding the dilution from options under QMI''s stock option plan)."The terms and conditions of the Agreement were determined with a view to meeting certain fundamental objectives, including those of ensuring that QI and QMI continue to enjoy a sufficient level of operational and financial flexibility and maintaining a debt level favourable to ongoing refinancing of the maturities of QMI''s various debt instruments. Considering the expected financial performance of QMI, we believe that the price paid is fair," said Jean-François Pruneau, Chief Financial Officer of QI and QMI."We are convinced of QMI''s potential to create value. For this reason, we are retaining a substantial stake in the company", said Michael Sabia, President and Chief Executive Officer of CDP.Cash purchase by QMIQMI intends to finance the repurchase of the 20,351,307 shares of QMI held by CDP by accessing financial markets.The parties'' intention in entering into this Agreement is to enable the immediate monetization by CDP of a significant portion of its interest in QMI. CDP will also have the ability to sell its remaining shares in QMI on or after January 1, 2019 through an initial public offering (IPO), therefore completing the monetization of its investment in QMI.Purchase by QI and issuance of convertible debentures by QIThe Convertible Debentures will have a term of six years expiring in 2018 and will bear interest at an annual rate of 4.125%, payable semi-annually in cash, in QI Class B Subordinate Shares or with the proceeds from the sale of QI Class B Subordinate Shares.At maturity, the Convertible Debentures will be payable in cash by QI at the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to prior redemption, conversion, purchase or repayment.One day prior to maturity (the Redemption Date), QI may redeem the outstanding Convertible Debentures by issuing that number of QI Class B Subordinate Shares obtained by dividing the outstanding principal amount by the then current market price of a QI Class B Subordinate Share, subject to a floor price of $38.50 per share (that is, a maximum number of 12,987,013 QI Class B Subordinate Shares corresponding to a ratio of $500 million to the floor price) and a ceiling price of $48.125 per share (that is, a minimum number of 10,389,610 QI Class B Subordinate Shares corresponding to a ratio of $500 million to the ceiling price).At any time prior to the Redemption Date, QI may redeem or convert, in whole or in part, the outstanding Convertible Debentures, subject to the terms of the trust indenture to be entered into among QI and Computershare Trust Company of Canada at closing (the Indenture).The Convertible Debentures will be convertible, at all times prior to the maturity date, into QI Class B Subordinate Shares by the holder in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.In all cases, QI has the option to pay an amount in cash equal to the market value of those shares, being the product of (a) the number of QI Class B Subordinate Shares that would have otherwise been issued and (b) the then current market price of a QI Class B Subordinate Share.A registration rights agreement granting demand registration rights and piggy-back registration rights to CDP in respect of the Convertible Debentures and the underlying QI Class B Subordinate Shares will be entered into at closing.CDP''s remaining interest - Exit rightThe Agreement, which does not result in any balance sheet obligation for QMI or QI, provides that on or after January 1, 2019, CDP will have exit rights, including requiring that QMI carry out an IPO or selling CDP''s remaining interest in QMI to a financial third party, without providing any right of first refusal or first offer to QI or QMI. In addition to the exit rights described above, demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights will be granted by QMI in favour of CDP by way of a separate agreement at closing.Changes to the QMI shareholders'' agreement In order to allow the exercise by CDP of the exit rights referred to in the previous paragraph, the parties have agreed to amend the shareholders'' agreement between QI, CDP Capital d''Amérique investissements inc. (formerly Capital Communications CDPQ inc.) and QMI dated October 23, 2000, as consolidated and amended by a shareholders'' agreement dated December 11, 2000.Subject to the amendments referred to above, the material terms and conditions of the shareholders'' agreement will remain unchanged. The existing shareholders'' agreement can be consulted on SEDAR, under the profile of QI, at www.sedar.com.ClosingThe transactions contemplated in the Agreement are currently expected to be completed on or around October 11, 2012, subject to a financing condition and customary closing conditions for transactions of this nature and regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy or sell securities in any jurisdiction.

Quebecor Media Inc. Consolidated Financial Statements Summaries (PDF)Supplementary Disclosure (PDF)  2006 highlights    Quebecor Media Inc.’s revenues up $308.0 million to $3.01 billion. Operating income up $69.2 million to $802.8 million Videotron Ltd.’s operating income increases by $99.2 million (24.0%). Quebecor Media posts net loss of $169.7 million, compared with net income of $96.5 million in 2005, due to loss on debt refinancing and impairment of goodwill in the Broadcasting segment. The refinancing operations will significantly reduce future financial expenses that would otherwise have been incurred. Videotron annual customer growth: +234,800 for cable telephone service, +154,000 for cable Internet access, +149,000 for illico Digital TV, +66,300 for all cable television services combined (i.e. analog service plus illico Digital TV). Videotron launches wireless telephone service. Nurun Inc. makes two strategic acquisitions in China and Spain.   Montréal, Québec – Quebecor Media Inc. generated total revenues of $3.01 billion in 2006, an increase of $308.0 million or 11.4%. All of Quebecor Media’s business segments, with the exception of Broadcasting, reported higher revenues. Quebecor Media’s operating income rose $69.2 million (9.4%), to $802.8 million in 2006, mainly as a result of higher operating income in the Cable segment ($99.2 million or 24.0%). “Quebecor Media continued growing its revenues and operating income in 2006,” said Pierre Karl Péladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor Inc. “The strong performance was spearheaded by the Cable segment, which posted significant increases in revenue and operating income driven by record customer growth for its digital cable television, Internet access and cable telephone services. Upheaval continued in the business environment for the Broadcasting and Newspapers segments with the growth of new media and proliferation of content distribution platforms, leading to changing consumer habits. Quebecor Media’s strategy in response to these changes has been to turn the new challenges into business opportunities by, among other things, pursuing a convergence strategy.” Quebecor Media recorded a net loss of $169.7 million in 2006, compared with net income of $96.5 million in 2005. The unfavourable variance of $266.2 million was essentially due to the impact of the recognition of a $342.6 million loss on debt refinancing in 2006 (compared with a $60.0 million loss in 2005). The refinancing operations will significantly reduce Quebecor Media’s financial expenses in comparison with the expenses that would otherwise have been incurred. Recognition of a $148.4 million non-cash charge for goodwill impairment in the Broadcasting segment and a $31.6 million non-cash charge for impairment of broadcasting licences also contributed to the unfavourable variance. These unfavourable factors were partially offset by the impact of the $69.2 million increase in operating income and a $60.7 million decrease in financial expenses in 2006. Fourth quarter 2006 In the fourth quarter of 2006, Quebecor Media’s revenues increased by $91.6 million (12.1%) to $847.8 million. All of Quebecor Media’s business segments reported higher revenues. Quebecor Media’s operating income rose by $26.0 million (12.2%), compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, to $239.4 million, mainly because of a $29.3 million (26.5%) increase in operating income in the Cable segment. Quebecor Media recorded a net loss of $97.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with net income of $58.4 million in the same period of 2005. The unfavourable variance of $155.5 million was mainly due to recognition in the fourth quarter of 2006 of non-cash charges totalling $179.2 million for impairment of goodwill and of a broadcasting licence. Reporting of financial resultsof Quebecor World Inc. and Quebecor Inc. delayed In the third quarter of 2006, Quebecor World announced that it planned to release its annual audited financial statements, Management Discussion and Analysis and press release for the 2006 fiscal year in late March 2007. Exceptionally for the 2006 fiscal year, these documents will be released later than usual to complete, for the first time, the assessment of internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and thereafter the required reports of Quebecor World’s auditor on such assessment and on the annual financial statements.

The $229.2 million (21.2%) increase was due primarily to customer growth. The segment generated operating income of $512.5 million in 2006, a $99.2 million (24.0%) increase due mainly to the higher revenues, including increases in some rates, which were partially offset by increases in some operating costs, primarily as a result of customer growth. Videotron grew its customer base by the following numbers during 2006:  234,800 more customers for cable telephone service (163,000 in 2005, the year the service was launched) 154,000 for cable Internet access, the largest annual growth in absolute terms since the service was launched in 1998 (135,400 in 2005) 149,000 for illico Digital TV, the largest annual growth in absolute terms since the service was launched in 1999 (140,900 in 2005) 66,300 for all cable television services combined, i.e. net increase for analog service and illico Digital TV, the largest net annual growth for cable television services since 1999 (53,500 in 2005). Videotron’s monthly average revenue per user increased by $9.51 (18.3%) from $51.86 in 2005 to $61.37 in 2006. In 2006, Videotron launched a wireless telephone service and rolled it out in several regions of Québec. The Cable segment generated free cash flows from operations of $138.6 million in 2006, compared with $168.6 million in 2005, a $30.0 million decrease. The positive impact of the increase in operating income was outweighed by an unfavourable variation in the net change in non-cash balances related to operations and an $82.7 million increase in additions to property, plant and equipment, including investment in network modernization and the cable telephony project. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Cable segment recorded revenues of $362.9 million, an increase of $63.8 million (21.3%). The segment’s operating income increased by $29.3 million (26.5%) to $139.8 million. Newspapers segment In 2006, the Newspapers segment’s revenues amounted to $928.2 million, a $12.6 million (1.4%) increase. Advertising revenues grew 3.1%, including increases at the free dailies and the community newspapers. Circulation revenues decreased by 3.8%. Distribution, commercial printing and other revenues combined declined by 1.3%. At the community newspapers, revenues grew by $10.9 million (4.2%) in 2006. At the urban dailies, revenues increased by $1.7 million (0.3%). Within this group, the revenues of the free dailies in Montréal, Toronto, Vancouver and Ottawa increased by 55.0% from 2005. Operating income decreased by $14.6 million (-6.6%) to $207.6 million in 2006. At the urban dailies, operating income declined by $9.8 million (-6.0%). The higher revenues did not entirely offset increases in operating expenses, such as newsprint and distribution costs, including advertising and promotion expenditures for the purpose of increasing the circulation of the Toronto Sun and Le Journal de Montréal. Labour costs were lower in 2006, mainly because of savings generated by the labour dispute at Le Journal de Montréal. The combined operating losses of the free dailies decreased by 25.9%. At the community newspapers, operating income increased by $4.7 million (6.5%), mainly because of the higher revenues, which were partially offset by increases in operating expenses, including labour and distribution costs. The Newspapers segment generated free cash flows from operations of $29.0 million in 2006, compared with $107.9 million in 2005, a $78.9 million decrease caused primarily by a $42.3 million increase in additions to property, plant and equipment due to progress payments made to acquire six new presses to print some of Quebecor Media’s newspapers. Lower operating income, expenditures made in connection with restructuring programs, and the unfavourable impact of the net change in non-cash balances related to operations were also factors in the decrease in free cash flows from operations. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Newspapers segment’s revenues increased by $3.9 million (1.6%) to $246.7 million and operating income decreased $5.8 million (-8.4%) to $63.5 million. In November 2006, Sun Media Corporation launched two new free dailies in the Ottawa area, 24 Hourstm in English and 24 Heuresmc in French. Construction of the printing plant in Saint-Janvier-de-Mirabel, Québec, is proceeding on schedule. The first press was commissioned on September 15, 2006 and is being used to print some Québec community newspapers. As of December 31, 2006, construction of the building and the mailroom was almost complete. On October 15, 2006, printing of The Ottawa Sun was also transferred in its entirety to the Saint-Janvier-de-Mirabel facility. Broadcasting segment The Broadcasting segment recorded revenues of $393.3 million in 2006, an $8.1 million (-2.0%) decrease. Revenues from broadcasting operations grew by $2.5 million (0.8%), mainly because of higher subscription revenues at the specialty channels (Mystère, argent, Prise 2, lcn, mentv and Mystery), revenues from broadcast rights and exclusive rights, revenues from commercial production, and advertising revenues at Sun TV. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the advertising revenues of the TVA Network. Distribution revenues declined by $7.4 million in 2006, primarily as a result of decreased revenues from theatrical and video releases of films. Publishing revenues increased by $1.0 million (1.3%) in 2006. The Broadcasting segment generated operating income of $42.1 million in 2006, a $10.9 million (-20.6%) decrease. Operating income from broadcasting operations declined by $8.9 million (-16.0%). The increased revenues and the impact of cost-control measures at Sun TV, as well as improved profitability at the specialty channels, did not entirely offset the impact of lower revenues and higher operating expenses at the TVA Network, including content-related costs. Operating income from distribution operations decreased by $2.0 million, mainly because of weaker results from theatrical and video releases than in 2005. Operating income from publishing operations increased by $1.1 million compared with 2005, mainly as a result of reductions in some operating costs, including printing and promotion. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the revenues of the Broadcasting segment amounted to $119.9 million, a slight $0.3 million (0.3%) increase. Operating income increased by $2.1 million (12.5%) to $18.9 million, primarily as a result of more favourable results from publishing operations. Leisure and Entertainment segment The revenues of the Leisure and Entertainment segment increased by $60.4 million (23.6%) to $315.8 million in 2006, due mainly to the impact of the acquisition of Sogides ltée in December 2005, as well as a 3.1% increase in the revenues of Archambault Group Inc. The Leisure and Entertainment segment’s operating income decreased by $7.7 million (-28.5%) to $19.3 million in 2006 because of weaker operating results, on a comparable basis, in the Books division, resulting primarily from the impact of the lower revenues at the publishing houses, including the academic segment, as well as a decrease in the operating income generated by Archambault Group, caused mainly by distribution and production operations. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the revenues of the Leisure and Entertainment segment increased by $17.4 million (19.8%) to $105.1 million. Operating income totalled $10.0 million, a $1.6 million (-13.8%) decrease. Interactive Technologies and Communications segment The Interactive Technologies and Communications segment’s revenues rose by $8.8 million (13.5%) to $73.9 million in 2006, reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Shanghai-based China Interactive Limited in January 2006 and of Madrid-based Crazy Labs Web Solutions, S.L. in July 2006, the recruitment of new customers and increased sales to existing customers. The segment’s operating income increased by $3.6 million (92.3%) to $7.5 million in 2006. The impact of customer growth, higher operating margins and the recognition in the fourth quarter of 2006 of federal research and development tax credits from previous years outweighed the unfavourable effect of exchange rate fluctuations and increases in some operating costs. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Interactive Technologies and Communications segment’s revenues increased by $3.8 million (23.5%) to $20.0 million and its operating income quadrupled to $3.3 million, compared with $0.8 million in the same period of 2005, an increase of $2.5 million. Internet/Portals segment Canoe Inc. recorded total revenues of $64.9 million in 2006, a $14.9 million (29.8%) increase. The revenues of the Progisia Informatique consulting division increased by 57.2% in 2006, mainly because of improved market positioning, as well as work done for subsidiaries of Quebecor Media. All revenue streams of the special-interest portals grew in 2006, resulting in an overall increase of 24.8%. Revenues at the general-interest portals increased by 11.2%, primarily as a result of higher advertising revenues. Operating income rose by $2.8 million (26.7%) to $13.3 million in 2006, mainly as a result of the revenue growth, which was partially offset by increases in some operating costs, including labour costs and advertising and promotion costs. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Internet/Portals segment’s revenues increased by $3.7 million (25.7%) to $18.1 million and its operating income decreased by $1.2 million (-31.6%) to $2.6 million. Impairment of goodwill and of broadcasting licences During the fourth quarter of 2006, Quebecor Media completed its annual impairment test for goodwill and for its broadcasting licences. Based on the results, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the Broadcasting segment’s goodwill and broadcasting licences was impaired. The advertising revenue base of general-interest broadcasters is under pressure due to fragmentation of the television audience. Quebecor Media therefore reviewed its business plan and recorded a total non-cash impairment charge in the amount of $180.0 million in 2006: $148.4 million, without any tax consequences, for goodwill ($144.1 million net of non-controlling interest) and $31.6 million for the broadcasting licences ($12.5 million net of income tax and non-controlling interest). Financing In 2006, Quebecor Media refinanced the totality of its Notes. The Senior Notes and Senior Discount Notes that were refinanced were repurchased in three stages, the first block on July 19, 2005, the second on January 17, 2006, and the third on July 15, 2006. Sun Media Corporation also repurchased part of its term loan “B” on December 29, 2006. In respect of these repurchases, Quebecor Media recognized a total loss on settlement of debt of $342.6 million in 2006 ($219.0 million net of income tax), compared with a $60.0 million loss on settlement of debt in 2005 ($41.0 million net of income tax). The loss includes the amount by which the total $1.4 billion consideration paid exceeded the book value of the notes and the related cross-currency swap agreements, and the write-down of deferred financial expenses. The refinancing operations will significantly reduce Quebecor Media’s financial expenses in comparison with the expenses that would otherwise have been incurred. Definitions Operating income In its analysis of operating results, the Company defines operating income or loss, as reconciled to net (loss) income under Canadian GAAP, as net (loss) income before amortization, financial expenses, reserve for restructuring of operations, impairment of assets and other special charges, gain on re-measurement of exchangeable debentures, loss on debt refinancing, (gain) loss  on sales of businesses and other assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, dividends on Preferred Shares of a subsidiary, net of income tax, non-controlling interest and the results of discontinued operations. Operating income as defined above is not a measure of results that is consistent with Canadian GAAP. It is not intended to be regarded as an alternative to other financial operating performance measures or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity. It is not intended to represent funds available for debt service, dividends, reinvestment or other discretionary uses, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. Management believes that operating income is a meaningful measure of performance. The Company considers the media and printing segments as a whole and uses operating income in order to assess the performance of its investment in Quebecor World and Quebecor Media. Management and our Board of Directors use this measure in evaluating the Company’s consolidated results as well as results of the Company’s operating segments. As such, this measure eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets, and it is unaffected by the capital structure or investment activities of the Company and of its segments. Operating income is also relevant because it is a significant component of the Company’s annual incentive compensation programs. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company’s segments. Other financial measures that take into account these costs, such as free cash flows from operations, are also used by the Company. In addition, measures like operating income are commonly used by the investment community to analyze and compare the performance of companies in the industries in which the Company is engaged. The Company’s definition of operating income may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Free cash flows from operations The Company uses free cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. Free cash flows from operations represent funds available for business acquisitions, the payment of dividends on equity shares and the repayment of long-term debt. Free cash flows from operations is not a measure of liquidity that are consistent with Canadian GAAP. It is not intended to be regarded as an alternative to other financial operating performance measures or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Free cash flows from operations is considered to be an important indicator of the Company’s liquidity and is used by its management and Board of Directors to evaluate cash flows generated by the Company’s segments’ operations. The Company’s definition of free cash flows from operations may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Average monthly revenue per user Average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, is an industry metric that the Company uses to measure its average cable, Internet and telephony revenues per month per basic cable customer. ARPU is not a measurement that is consistent with Canadian GAAP, and the Company’s definition and calculation of ARPU may not be the same as identically titled measurements reported by other companies. The Company calculates ARPU by dividing its combined cable television, Internet access and telephony revenues by the average number of its basic cable customers during the applicable period, and then dividing the resulting amount by the number of months in the applicable period.
