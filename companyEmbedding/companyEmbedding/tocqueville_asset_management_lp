TocquevilleInsightsCaveat Emptor 




Caveat Emptor
By Paul Kleinschmidt on September 17, 2015
Buyer beware: ETF’s may not be what they appear
Exchange Traded Funds (ETF’s) have been all the rage the past few years as money has flowed out of actively managed portfolios and into investment vehicles that mirror various indices. After all, portfolio managers rarely outperform the broader stock indices and the overwhelming majority of actively managed portfolios have underperformed their benchmarks over the past few years. Furthermore the difference in fees can have a meaningful impact on long term compounding of returns, or so the thinking goes.
Allegedly, research analysts of today have more sophisticated systems and processes at their disposal and, notwithstanding Reg FD, have greater access to information than even before. Throw in the continued proliferation of index funds to the mix and some media and famed investors have noted that a much more efficient market makes it nearly impossible for even the best money managers to offer comparable returns and less risk than the broader markets. A  more likely reason, in our view,  is that we are in the midst of a liquidity driven market which has pushed shares of the most widely owned and largest companies higher. Since these are the stocks found in the most widely used indices, which are weighted by market capitalization, the indices may have over-estimated the strength of the markets as a whole. For example, small capitalization names, particularly on the value side, have considerably lagged the indices.
However, we believe there are signs pointing to a change in these conditions, possibly setting the stage for more of a ‘stock-pickers’ market. Maybe; maybe not. What is certain is that investors have flocked to ETF’s in recent years, pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into these vehicles in an attempt to lower management fees and mimic market or sector returns; but, as The Wall Street Journal recently noted,  ETF investors may be in for a rude surprise. When the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1,000 points on August 24th, “Dozens of ETFs traded at sharp discounts to the sum of their holdings, worsening losses for many fund holders who sold during the panic.” In fact, brand name ETF’s, meant to do nothing more than track major indices exhibited deeply disconcerting behavior. The $66 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, to name just one, was down 26% in intraday trading, while the S&P 500 index fell only as much as 5.3% during the session. While this ‘flash crash’ in ETF’s didn’t last long, the price action exhibited was concerning to say the least. There has been plenty of speculation as to what may have caused this worrying event; Rule 48, algorithmic trading, or perhaps less liquidity in the markets overall as a result of recent banking regulations. No one knows for certain and there do not appear to be any fixes in the works. While it’s just a hunch, it certainly feels as though the last chapter to this story has yet to be written.
Managing wealth for successive generations is tougher work than it may appear at first blush. To combat the eroding forces of inflation and taxation, coupled with a demand for income from an increasing number of family members as the years wear on, is a distinct challenge. However there are a few golden rules that are instrumental in meeting the challenges of multi-generational wealth management. Among them is, as Benjamin Graham put it, avoiding “really dreadful losses”. Sometimes those types of losses occur by taking outsized risks and sometimes they occur by buying good businesses selling at euphorically high price levels. What’s clear now is that ETF investors should no longer consider themselves immune from “really dreadful losses” simply because they have switched to passively managed investment vehicles. Again, as Mr. Graham put it, “The intelligent investor realizes stocks become less risky, not more, as their prices fall.” This, we believe, is something an ETF will never realize. Using market opportunities when the “baby is thrown out with the bath water” can provide active managers with a focus on a margin of safety an opportunity to buy excellent companies that have previously been too expensive to own, a key feature of long term value investing. Given the recent wild gyrations, we believe it behooves wealth owners and their trusted advisors to question whether or not lower fees and rote investing are worth the accompanying risk.

Our Firm





Our Firm
Tocqueville Asset Management L.P. was founded in 1985 as an independently owned partnership focusing exclusively on the long-term growth and preservation of our clients’ capital.
Our firm follows two guiding principles:

Provide excellent client service.
Avoid speculation and resist fads.




How Are We Different?












Autonomy
Tocqueville is a wholly independent, privately owned partnership. This eliminates the corporate conformity often found in public companies – a conformity that arises from the need to provide short-term shareholder value.
It also allows for an alignment of interests: Portfolio managers at Tocqueville invest alongside clients, putting our own capital into the same investments that we recommend to our clients. And our autonomy ensures that we never sell products or services that our clients do not need. The term “relationship manager” does not exist at Tocqueville.





Meeting Your Needs
Our respectable investment returns notwithstanding, we measure our success by the long-term relationships we develop with people who have come to us to preserve, protect, and enhance their capital. Consequently, our firm’s focus is to provide our clients with outstanding service, rather than marketing the investment flavor of the day.
What does outstanding service mean to you? You want access: to your investments, to your investment team, at any time. We are dedicated to providing that access, to responding rapidly to your needs. And the measure of our service is a client with financial peace of mind.





Time
We evaluate the success of our investment decisions over years rather than weeks or quarters, and we avoid the noise and hyperbole of Wall Street and its attendant media by relying upon rigorous proprietary research to buttress those decisions. The term “relationship manager” does not exist at Tocqueville.
Focusing on the signal rather than the noise, while taking a long-term perspective, allows us to look past ephemeral investment schemes and seek out more durable opportunities.

Few would dispute that the twelve-year (and still counting) bull market in gold has been the opportunity of this investment lifetime. Even fewer have participated.

How Tocqueville Asset Management L.P. Simplified Compliance with Laserfiche Forms













Laserfiche Solution Contributed by: Linda Schecter, Records Retention Officer, Tocqueville Asset Management
Tocqueville Asset Management L.P. is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor that provides portfolio management services to high net-worth individuals, institutional clients and mutual funds. As a financial services firm, Tocqueville has to comply with SEC, FINRA and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance regulations, among others. One such regulation requires employees to report any financial transactions that they’ve performed each quarter. Using Laserfiche Forms, Tocqueville streamlined this process completely.
Legacy Process
With over 100 employees, the legacy quarterly transaction reports process was time consuming and paper-heavy.

The compliance officer had to create the document and use mail merge to fill out each employee’s name on the form.
He would print the cover sheet and form,  staple them together, then hand them out individually to employees.
The employee signed the form and returned it by either hand-delivering it to the compliance department or sending it via interoffice mail.
Occasionally, a form would be incomplete and had to be returned for revision and resubmission.
The compliance officer kept a manual checklist of who completed the form and who still had to turn it in.

Laserfiche Forms
Employees are now emailed a link to the quarterly transaction report in Laserfiche Forms. The employee enters his three digit phone extension, which is used to auto-populate information in the form from the employee database.
The employee fills out a quarterly transaction report in Laserfiche Forms
The employee selects the appropriate option regarding their security transactions, uploads any required documentation and applies an electronic signature before submitting the form. The form cannot be submitted until all required information is entered.
The employee signs the form by either typing a signature or drawing it with a mouse or stylus
As soon as the form is submitted, it is saved into the Laserfiche repository and Laserfiche Workflow takes over.
Laserfiche Workflow
The compliance officer reviews each form and changes the status in the Laserfiche metadata to either approved or rejected. If the form is rejected, the submitter is notified by email and has to re-submit the form. Laserfiche Workflow then removes the first submission and replaces it with the new submission.

Approved forms are stored in the employee’s folder.
Approved quarterly transaction reports are saved in the employee’s Laserfiche folder
Short-cuts to the specific folder with the report are created in the Quarterly Transaction Report folder for easier viewing by the compliance officer.
The compliance officer can view all quarterly transaction reports through the use of short-cuts
Laserfiche Workflow sends three emails to the compliance department when they request them:

A list of all employees who haven’t submitted a form. This report is generated by compiling a list of all employees who submitted the form based on information stored in the form’s metadata against a list of all active employees pulled from an employee database.



A list of forms that have been submitted and need review. This report is created by compiling a list of all submitted forms with a pending review status.
A list of all submitted forms and their status, alphabetized by employee name.


Here is the workflow that sends the emails:

Benefits of Laserfiche
Automating the quarterly transaction reporting process with Laserfiche has resulted in the following benefits for Tocqueville Asset Management:

Printing and manual distribution of paper forms has been eliminated, saving time and money.
More employees submit the forms immediately. The first time this process was launched, 40 responses were received within 24 hours.
The chief compliance officer can quickly see which employees have not submitted a form, allowing him to follow up with each employee directly.
