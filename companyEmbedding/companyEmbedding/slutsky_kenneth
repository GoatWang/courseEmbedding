                        Ken combines specialized tax knowledge with a wide range of experience to help clients accomplish their business and personal planning goals. His work includes advising on business deals, trusts and estates, and investment management. A strategic thinker, Ken believes that successful tax planning requires flexibility and the capacity to move beyond a traditional linear approach. He thrives on complex projects that have many interrelated tax and nontax factors. Working closely with his clients, Ken immerses himself in the facts–as well as the key tax principles and business considerations–and applies his significant technical knowledge to develop effective solutions.
