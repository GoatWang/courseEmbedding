Samba Gourmet is proud to bring to the U.S. Brazil's favorite bonbon - the original brigadeiro® (bree.ga.day.row) ~ photos ©Silvia Aronson




We are Samba Gourmet, the first brigadeiro wholesaler in the United States. 
Our goal is to make this delicious truffle known and loved by every single person in America.
We are proud to make our brigadeiros with the finest ingredients available in the market. Besides being unique, our product is all natural, using no artificial coloring, no high fructose corn syrup and no preservatives.
We have recently been awarded the bronze medal on “Top Luxury Caramel” during the Best Chocolatiers & Confectioners in America Awards. It’s the first time the brigadeiro wins such award outside of Brazil!
Brigadeiro’s sweet texture is halfway between truffle and fudge. The first bite is unique, it melts in your mouth. 
Look for our products locally in South Florida or at www.amazon.com







    Don't miss it!

Here you can feature an article about your company or product, take your time and write whatever you feel would interest our visitors. Articles are a great way to express your opinions and knowledge about your business experience.
Example,
We have an entire suite of services that make us a great online City business directory.  It is targeted toward local consumers, visitors and tourists visiting the area and carries virtually everything one can imagine.
This local business directory includes legal firms, financial services, health care products, and fashion for the whole family, real estate, automotive repairs shops, beauty parlours, insurance agencies, and many more.
To begin with, each business must provide a profile of the company and showcase their services and products on the premium digital storefront that consumers visit.  In addition, We have made it much easier for consumers to quickly contact the business with any questions they may have.
A hyperlink has been provided so that each person can send an email or even visit the company's website for more information.  This can be done from anywhere, including using a mobile phone or PDA handheld device.
Moreover, should the potential customer want to visit the business premises there is no need to call in for directions.  All they have to do is click on the button provided and the directions and map to the premises they are looking for will be quickly downloaded. Using our S.M.A.R.T design for touch screen ease of use in addition to making our website light such that pages download in record time, the visitor does not need to sit and wait for the pages to load in order to get information, maps or directions needed.  This has made us very easy to work with and navigate.
A great advantage to using this City business directory is that we have created social utilities where consumers can chat with each other.  This helps the consumers get first hand information and feedback on how the businesses they would like to deal with operate. Among other things provided are informative articles and blogs that one can read to gain more information on various products and services showcased.
Moreover, if one is visiting the City and is unfamiliar with the area, there is no need to worry in the event of a mishap such as automotive failure.  The tourist or visitor can quickly look up the closest repair shop using their mobile phone or PDA and have their needs met.  The same applies to finding great restaurants in which to dine and one-of-a-kind places that they may have heard of and wanted to visit.
Some businesses even showcase commercials that anyone visiting the site can watch.  This gives potential clients a good idea of what to expect from the company.  We have gone the extra mile to ensure that every person visiting our site is well informed before engaging the services of any business showcased on it.
