			We Helped Reinvent Online EducationNow We’re Re-Reinventing It 

Ten years ago, the Noodle Partners team helped reinvent online education. But ten years is an eternity in a tech-driven field. So now we’re re-reinventing how higher ed happens online. Measured against traditional Online Program Managers (OPMs), Noodle Partners brings programs online less expensively, with greater agility and in better alignment with universities’ goals.















			Creating anOnline Program Is EasyMaking It Great Is Not		

Online education is no longer a novel or niche idea. It is the fastest growing segment in higher education, accounting for 20% of all enrollees and 30% of graduate-level certificates and degrees. It’s also getting increasingly competitive, as more and better programs are launched every semester. As a university administrator, you need to go online quickly, economically and elegantly, creating programs that students can’t wait to tell their friends about and that professors want to teach. Noodle Partners will help you reimagine what online learning can be.

			A Noodle Approach		

Noodle Partners helps colleges and universities create and manage first-rate online and hybrid programs. We’re a new generation of OPM. Leveraging our expert staff, funding and tech — along with $1.5 billion of investment in our technology and service providers – we can bring you more control, less risk and lower cost. Further, we do so with a collaborative approach that can help you transform your campus-based programs even as you grow your online presence.

			High Quality,Less Riskand Lower CostChoose Any Three		

Compared to traditional OPMs, we’re far less expensive – generally between $15,000 and $30,000 less per student over the life of a program.


We’re also more flexible: we strive to leverage a school’s internal capacity and can tap our network of providers to respond quickly to marketplace changes, competitive challenges, and opportunities. Importantly, our model is far less risky to the university, both financially and operationally. Our interests are aligned with yours. The Noodle Partners team has the experience and track record of having created and managed dozens of top-rated programs.

			Better Than Rolling Your Own		

Working with us is better than going it alone. Schools that try to build online programs without help generally fail to meet their academic and financial goals. Noodle Partners will set clear goals and work with you to achieve them. But we won’t stop you from doing lots of things yourself — in fact, we’ll help you build on and expand your internal capacities.
Learn more












			The Re-Reinventors		

The people at Noodle Partners have designed, built and managed online programs with some of the country’s most exacting universities. We’ve done it while working at other OPMs and at technology-savvy universities. Our CEO founded and ran 2U, and several of our key team members were among the leadership team at 2U. Our COO ran two of the three largest higher ed marketing businesses. And our Chief Academic Officer built several groundbreaking online programs while at USC.

			Talk to UsEven If You Love Another OPM		


If you think you’d like to work with Noodle Partners, give us a call. And if you don’t think you’d like to work with Noodle Partners, give us a call anyway. We’d love to talk with you about your institution, what it has accomplished online and what you would like it to accomplish.

Noodle Partners raises $4 million to help colleges deliver degrees online

Noodle Partners Inc., a new education venture from the founder of The Princeton Review and 2U Inc., John Katzman, has raised $4 million in venture funding to help colleges and universities deliver high-quality certificate and degree programs online.
Philadelphia-based Osage Venture Partners led the investment in Noodle Partners and was joined by New Markets Venture Partners, 500 Startups and others.
Katzman tells TechCrunch that the challenge in delivering online education at the college and university level has changed dramatically over the last decade, and not just because of the rise of smartphones.
“People did not believe that higher ed could be as good online as a campus-based program. That’s because the first wave was full of for-profits that were just not very good schools. Today, there are many great schools online and we know the problem is not the medium. The new challenge is building and offering programs that are great, but also lower the cost of higher education,” Katzman said in 2008, when he co-founded 2U Inc. with Chip Paucek and Jeremy Johnson.
Trump University, and the University of Phoenix (owned by Apollo Education) are two famous examples of unscrupulous, for-profit online schools in that earlier wave. These organizations sold students on useless degrees and costly seminars that would leave them more in debt than anything else.
College enrollment in the U.S. has declined for five straight years, according to the most recent available data from the National Center for Education Statistics. That correlates with a 34% increase in the cost for undergraduate tuition, fees, room, and board at public colleges and universities, and a 25% increase at private non-profit institutions between 2004 and 2014.
Katzman believes that offering more of their degree programs online, and at a higher quality than ever before, will help colleges reverse that trend.
New York-based Noodle Partners offers colleges and universities help setting up an online degree program, instructional design for courses within the program, recruiting, tech support, and measuring student engagement along the way to course completion. The startup charges for setup and a flat fee per student.
Other companies doing this work (called “online program management”) will typically take a large percent of tuition they help schools generate from their online offerings, cutting into the school’s already challenged margins.
Competitors to Noodle Partners include 2U, the company Katzman started but with which he is no longer affiliated, Academic Partnerships, HotChalk, Keypath, Pearson Embanet, Wiley Education Solution and others.
Osage Venture Partners’ Nate Lentz said he backed Noodle Partners believing, “Something needs to change the cost curve in higher ed.”
The investor expects Noodle Partners to use its funding to roll out its OPM services and technology to top colleges and universities in the U.S., and expand enrollment in online programs at the schools where the company is already working today.

Show moreFood You want to feed your family healthy food, but making the best choices can be difficult, especially if you're on a budget or short on time   or if you or any members of your family have special dietary needs. Fortunately, Walmart makes it easy to plan meals and stock up on delicious and nutritious food that is also affordable. Barbecue essentials Anytime is a great time to fire up the barbecue. Grab some hot dogs, hamburgers, steaks, chops, corn on the cob and whatever else you like to grill and get ready for a fun food fest. Of course, barbecue essentials don't necessarily need to be cooked on a grill. Don't forget the: Chips and snacks, like pistachios and mixed nuts, almonds and snack crackers Dips and spreads, including salsa, guacamole and black bean dip Side dishes of rice, mac and cheese and pasta salad beans and chili Condiments, like ketchup, mustard, mayo and more You'll also find Walmart's lowest prices on picnic items like paper plates, napkins, plastic cups, plasticware and more, should you want to take your meal to the great outdoors. Beverages From water and juice to coffee, beer and wine, you'll find a wide variety of delicious and refreshing beverages at Walmart, all at Every Day Low Prices. Explore the varied selection of juices, where you'll find common favorites like apple, orange and cranberry juice as well as mixed fruit and vegetable juices and much more. Browse the soft drinks: colas, root beer, cream soda, fruit sodas and more in both standard and sugar-free varieties, including options from popular brands such as Coca Cola, Pepsi and A&W. If you've been exercising, try sports drinks, like Gatorade, to keep yourself hydrated and maybe a caffeinated energy drink to keep yourself going throughout the day. There is also a large selection of hot beverages, including coffee, tea and hot cocoa, plus adult beverages, including beer, wine and spirits. To turn an ordinary glass of water into a more appealing beverage, consider powdered drink mixes and drink enhancers, which come in a wide range of flavors and include diet and fortified options featuring vitamins and electrolytes. Healthy options Are you confused by all the nutritional information that's available? Walmart's Great For You products feature a simple icon that lets you know you're choosing a healthy item. That includes lots of the foods nutritionists say people should get more of, including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and lean meats. It's also easy to find foods that meet special requirements. Simply filter your grocery searches by dietary need and you'll find products that are: Gluten free Sugar free Sodium free Fat free Nut free Dairy free There are also natural, organic, vegetarian, kosher and halal options. Walmart makes it easier to find the foods you want while simultaneously meeting your dietary requirements. No matter what type of special diet you are looking for, there are options that will help you make the right food choices day in and day out. Organic foods If you prefer to feed your family with natural or organic foods, enjoy Walmart's inventory of organic delights, which are made without artificial ingredients; they're grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers. A food is labeled as organic by the way farmers grow and process their agricultural products, like different meats, fruits, vegetables, grains and dairy products. Organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution. The farmers who grow organic produce don't use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds. For example, organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants, while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds. So what makes a product organic for certain? The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) established a certification program that requires all organic-labeled foods to meet strict government standards first. These standards regulate how such foods are grown, handled and processed. Thus, any product labeled as organic must be USDA certified. You could look through a variety of foods and check for the organic label on each one, but it s a much easier shopping process when everything can be found together, in one convenient location. Whatever your dietary goals or requirements are, you can easily find foods that meet your needs at Walmart. Just filter your search by dietary need and you'll find a large selection of delicious foods. Save Money.
