Dollar Tree Appoints Gregory M. Bridgeford to Its Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































Dollar Tree Appoints Gregory M. Bridgeford to Its Board of Directors

CHESAPEAKE, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR), North America’s leading operator of 
      discount variety stores, announced today that Gregory M. Bridgeford has 
      been appointed as a new independent director to the Company’s board.
    

      Mr. Bridgeford, age 61, is a seasoned retail executive, recently 
      retiring in 2014 after a successful 32-year career with Lowe’s 
      Companies, Inc. At Lowe’s, Bridgeford was promoted to chief customer 
      officer in 2012, after serving as executive vice president of business 
      development since 2004. Bridgeford joined Lowe’s in 1982 and served in 
      leadership roles of increasing responsibility, including vice president 
      of corporate development, senior vice president of merchandising, senior 
      vice president of marketing, and executive vice president of business 
      development where he oversaw corporate research, strategic planning, 
      business process improvement, international development, and real 
      estate, engineering and construction.
    

      Macon Brock, Chairman of the Board stated, “We are delighted to welcome 
      Greg to our board of directors. Greg is a proven retail leader with a 
      long track record of success. At Dollar Tree, our focus has always been 
      on the customer. We are confident that Greg’s demonstrated success in 
      merchandising, marketing and strategic planning roles will be valuable 
      assets to our board as we continue to grow both our Dollar Tree and 
      Family Dollar businesses.”
    

      Mr. Bridgeford commented, “I am pleased to have the opportunity to join 
      the Dollar Tree board. I have long-admired the Company’s disciplined 
      approach to managing and growing its business while maintaining a fixed 
      price-point at $1.00 per item. The recent acquisition of Family Dollar 
      diversifies its business model and supports the Company’s efforts to 
      serve more customers in more markets. I look forward to contributing to 
      the Dollar Tree board in its continuing efforts to be the leader in the 
      value retail sector.”
