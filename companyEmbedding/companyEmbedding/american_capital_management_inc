In addition, companies are selected that possess the necessary profitability and financial strength to support their growth. We believe that companies with these characteristics provide a favorable risk/reward ratio over time.

ECONOMIC & INVESTMENT OUTLOOK APRIL, 2017

                     What a difference a year makes! It has been a profitable and comfortable start to 2017 compared to a volatile first quarter last year.  The first five days, week, month and quarter were all up, so the odds favor another double-digit return this year.  Furthermore, the often discussed “Great Rotation” may be starting. Inflows into equities surpassed $118 billion since the election and were four times the size of inflows into bonds.  This is a small offset to bond inflows that dwarfed equities by $650 billion since March 2009, but highlights the power if these trends were reversed.  Given the healthy start to the year, is there anything to worry about?  There are always worries, but the markets thrive on healthy skepticism.  Fortunately, politics and valuation top the list, not the growth outlook.  Investors remain concerned that bipartisan politics will derail progress and the market may be overbought following a 13% gain since the election.  A healthy correction (5-10%) could occur anytime, but we focus longer term and believe equities are attractive based on moderate growth, low interest rates and subdued inflation.

Our Approach





Philosophy
Strategy
 

Specializing in Small Growth Companies
ACM specializes in managing portfolios of quality small and medium sized growth companies – the most innovative and more rapidly growing sector of the U.S. economy.
Unique Approach


    	            	We believe that above average returns can be achieved by owning a diversified group of companies growing 50% greater than the average company in the S&P 500.
                    

We believe that our firm and investment approach is unique relative to most investment management organizations.  ACM specializes in our market segment and we are dedicated to this effort.  We are consistent and select our investments from a universe list of 100 companies focused on revenue size rather than market capitalization.  The list represents a quality group of companies within our market segment that possesses the necessary profitability and financial strength to support their growth.  Our approach provides us with the opportunity to hold companies for an extended period of time as they grow from small to medium sized corporations.  We invest for the long term and own our investments considerably longer than the industry average.  This has resulted in above average returns, lower turnover and greater tax efficiency.  In addition, our investment strategy and longer term approach result in greater “takeover” activity thereby enhancing returns to our clients.  Since we emphasize growth companies, the majority of our potential investments are focused on healthcare and technology – two of the more rapidly growing sectors of our economy.  We are small and flexible, a major advantage today.

Managing Investments




All accounts are individually managed by a portfolio manager dedicated to your relationship and tailored to your needs and objectives.  We emphasize equities for capital appreciation, supplemented by convertible bonds and fixed income investments when appropriate.

Our investment decision making process is based upon an interplay of our Investment Committee, portfolio managers and external research and recommendations. Our Investment Committee meets regularly to discuss topics of strategic importance to determine our intermediate to longer term investment strategy. We review the overall international economic environment, interest rate trends, corporate profits, domestic and international political factors, stock market valuations, technical factors and the relative attraction of smaller company investments to the overall market. These meetings determine our overall asset allocation mix as we manage our portfolios in conjunction with the needs and objectives of our clients.
Our portfolios typically own 20-30 investments with initial positions of approximately 2%-5% of the portfolio.  We reduce positions when investments appear substantially overvalued, represent an excessive percentage of the portfolio’s total assets or are experiencing deteriorating fundamentals.
