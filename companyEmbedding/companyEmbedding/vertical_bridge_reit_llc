Vertical Bridge On A Roll
About an hour ago, Vertical Bridge, a privately-owned REIT focused on the ownership of wireless communication towers, announced acquisitions of towers from iHeartMedia and U.S. Cellular. iHeartMedia has agreed to sell a select portfolio of its tower assets to Vertical Bridge for up to $400 million. This transaction, which is still subject to due diligence and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in Q1 2015. “This is a great example of how we continue to optimize our balance sheet and maximize liquidity — and how we continually review our entire portfolio of assets to ensure we operate them in the most efficient way possible and invest our resources in the highest return opportunities,” said Richard J. Bressler, President and Chief Financial Officer of iHeartMedia, Inc. There will be no impact on the company’s broadcast capabilities and operations; at closing, the company will enter into a lease with respect to the sold tower assets that will ensure the ability of its broadcast operations to continue without interruption. “We are excited to add this high quality tower portfolio to our existing assets,” said Alexander L. Gellman, CEO of Vertical Bridge Holdings, LLC. “We are looking forward to a strong partnership with iHeartMedia. In addition to being a premier broadcast portfolio, these sites already have many broadband telephony and data tenants and the capacity and potential to add many more. With this latest transaction, Vertical Bridge now has approximately 2,000 revenue producing sites that are owned or under definitive agreement.”
U.S. Cellular also announced today that they have entered into an agreement with Vertical Bridge to sell 595 towers for approximately $159 million. This transaction is also expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. “Vertical Bridge is excited to acquire this portfolio of core towers in large metropolitan markets,” said Gellman. “Many of these sites are in locations that would be very difficult to replace. We are also happy to work again with a quality counterparty like U.S. Cellular.” Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and TD Securities (USA) LLC served as financial advisors to U.S. Cellular on this transaction. “We are very pleased to announce this transaction,” said Kenneth R. Meyers, U.S. Cellular president and CEO. “We will use the proceeds from the sale of these non-strategic assets to invest in other long-term investments that position U.S. Cellular for future growth opportunities.”

We are the largest owner of broadcast towers and the largest private owner and manager of broadband towers in the US. We have experienced leasing and operations teams with specialists located at our Headquarters in Boca Raton as well as managers in the field, all devoted to serving your co-location needs. We are committed to providing an efficient and seamless leasing process.

We provide Build-to-Suit tower services across the country for all wireless carriers and can take on a project at any stage of development. We have the ability to deploy large amounts of capital to handle projects of any size, and our team has built thousands of towers for customers in all 50 states. We work with local municipalities, carriers, and site acquisition resources to find sites that resolve issues with coverage gaps or capacity to implement a fast and flexible solution for our clients. 
For more information on our development services, contact our Development Team. 


Vertical Bridge utilizes a master/sub lease structure.  This allows us to bring you more business than you would be able to get on your own due to our pre-negotiated master lease agreements.  Carriers want ease and speed, and the master/sub-lease agreements that we use at Vertical Bridge are the mechanism that provide it.  


For tower owners looking to generate income through a sale of assets, Vertical Bridge can work with you to ensure you receive the value envisioned. We close deals quickly and for the best possible price, whether it’s for one or 100 towers. We turn around a valuation analysis without delays and follow through with a swift closing. Vertical Bridge’s expertise in maximizing revenue also helps owners who do not want to sell, but want incremental income, by managing and marketing market assets through our rich database of interested clients and tenants. 
For more information on making money from your assets, contact our M&A Team. 


With increasing demand for data usage as people use the internet to manage more and more aspects of their lives, the wireless industry has had to evolve quickly and seamlessly. We offer a variety of structures for small cell and IoT co-locations, allowing our customers to provide better capacity and coverage without bigger footprints. Antennas no longer have to mean large, visible structures. 
For more information on our small cell structures, contact our Real Estate Team.


At Vertical Bridge, we make it our priority to ensure our valued landlords are satisfied. Our landlords have an opportunity to receive a lump sum payment or structured payout verses the current lease rent payments. 
Cash today can be a tremendous advantage in meeting current financial plans and goals.  At Vertical Bridge we strive to meet the varied requests of our landlords and offer several income options for convenience. 
Do you have a tower or rooftop antenna on your property that is owned by Vertical Bridge?

About Us





 

 Vertical Bridge is the largest private owner and manager of communication infrastructure in the U.S.  We own or master lease towers, rooftops, billboards, utility attachments and other site location assets, and we lease them to telecommunications carriers and other users of wireless technology. 
Vertical Bridge sites and assets are located in hard-to-zone areas, and offer significant opportunities to our clients to enhance their subscribers’ experience via improved network performance. 
Vertical Bridge offers some of the best solutions in the industry because we are: 
Geographically dispersed including urban, suburban, traffic corridor and rural locations
Frequently located in areas with no other competing or available structures
Built for capacity, which allows for more additional communications tenants in the future 
Provide large ground space, which allows carriers room to place on-the-ground equipment, including C-RAN hubs
Constructed to meet or exceed applicable standards
History
Since our company was founded in 2014, Vertical Bridge has quickly emerged as the largest private owner and manager of communications infrastructure in the United States, dedicated to providing our customers with superior service in a dynamic communications market. Vertical Bridge currently has more than 55,000 sites nationwide, including 5,600 wireless and broadcast towers, 7,000 master lease rooftop and land assets and 43,000 billboards. These assets have been assembled through more than 100 asset acquisitions and 75 real estate portfolios. Vertical Bridge also has the largest broadcast tower portfolio in the U.S. and on average the tallest tower portfolio in the US.

Whether you are a small real estate owner or a large, publicly traded REIT, Vertical Bridge is a proven partner.
If you’d like more information on partnering with Vertical Bridge, contact our Real Estate Team.






                        REITS and Rooftops                    

                        Landowners                    

                        Utility Owners                    

                        Billboard Owners                    


Vertical Bridge has an unparalleled focus on co-locating telecom infrastructure on non-owned assets. We have created hundreds of millions of dollars in recurring revenue for our clients by leasing unused or un-leasable portions of their properties. 
Building owners look to Vertical Bridge to bring income to otherwise unused space on their rooftops. We employ world class systems and workflows, and unlike many of our competitors, our systems are designed from the ground up to accommodate the unique needs of building owners. Our owner's portal is a web-site specifically designed for each owner, and it is an up to the last second snapshot of rent roll, pending deals, deals signed, other reports and a document repository.
 


As the largest privately held tower owner and operator in the U.S., Vertical Bridge offers tremendous advantages to landowners. Our experience and knowledge allows us to eliminate the middle man so landowners generate more income. Additionally, our national scope and private company structure allow us to find quick and efficient solutions as well as adapt to our landowners' needs, resulting in greater benefits and customer service.  
Safety, reliability and limited access to your structures are our number one priority, and our dedicated team of former utility experts is second to none.


Vertical Bridge has a proven long term track record of helping utility owners generate revenue from their assets. We work closely with owners to bring them new revenue by adding assets to existing utility structures such as communications and transmission towers, generating facilities, water tanks, and substations. We place assets at the front of carriers’ target lists to maximize income opportunities, and our experienced leadership and knowledge allow us to manage the process for owners, according to their processes, so their employees can stay focused on their businesses.


At 40-80 feet in height, billboards have become an attractive asset class for telecommunications providers. Vertical Bridge can market your billboards to carriers and maximize your revenue opportunity – both short and long term. We can also manage all aspects of the process so your employees can stay focused where they need to: your core business.
