                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Whenever additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Partner is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, as required by Partnership business obligations, remaining Partners may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case the allocation of profits or losses among all the Partners will be adjusted to reflect the aggregate change in Capital Contributions by the Partners.

Any advance of money to the Partnership by any Partner in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt owed by the Partnership and not an increase in Capital Contribution of the Partner. This liability will be repaid with interest at rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Partners within the limits of what is required or permitted in the Act. This liability will not entitle the lending Partner to any increased share of the Partnership's profits nor to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Partners as may be determined by a majority of the Partners.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Accounts") will be maintained for each Partner and their Initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any Additional Capital Contributions made by any Partner will be credited to that Partner's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Partner on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Capital Contributions.

Financial Decisions

Decisions regarding the distribution of profits, allocation of losses, and the requirement for Additional Capital Contributions as well as all other financial matters will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Profit and Loss

Subject to any other provisions of this Agreement, the net profits and losses of the Partnership, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the Partners in equal proportions (the "Profit and Loss Distribution").

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Partnership will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Partner. The books and records of the Partnership will reflect all the Partnership’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Partnership.

Annual Report

As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Partnership will furnish to each Partner an annual report showing a full and complete account of the condition of the Partnership. This report will consist of at least the following documents:

a statement of all information as will be necessary for the preparation of each Partner's income or other tax returns;

a copy of the Partnership's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year; and

any additional information that the Partners may require.



Banking and Partnership Funds

Fiscal Year

Audit

Any of the Partners will have the right to request an audit of the Partnership books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Partnership. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Partners. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Partners for any fiscal year.

Management

Except as all of the Partners may otherwise agree in writing, all actions and decisions respecting the management, operation and control of the Partnership and its business will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Contract Binding Authority

Each Partner will have authority to bind the Partnership in contract.

Tax Matters Partner

The tax matters partner will be ____________________________ (the "Tax Matters Partner"). The Tax Matters Partner will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all tax returns and reports for the Partnership and make any related elections that the Partners deem advisable.

A Tax Matters Partner can voluntarily withdraw from the position of Tax Matters Partner or can be appointed or replaced by a majority vote of the other Partners. In the event of a withdrawal of the Tax Matters Partner from the Partnership, the remaining Partners will appoint a successor as soon as practicable.

Meetings

Regular meetings of the Partners will be held as required.

Any Partner can call a special meeting to resolve issues that require a vote, as indicated by this Agreement, by providing all Partners with reasonable notice. In the case of a special vote, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was held.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Partners.

Admitting a New Partner

A new Partner may only be admitted to the Partnership with a majority vote of the existing Partners.

Any new Partner agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Partner will execute such documents as are needed to effect the admission of the new Partner. Any new Partner will receive such business interest in the Partnership as determined by a unanimous decision of the other Partners.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Any Partner will have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership at any time. Written notice of intention to withdraw must be served upon the remaining Partners at least three (3) months prior to the withdrawal date.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A Dissociated Partner will only exercise the right to withdraw in good faith and will act to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Partners as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Events resulting in the involuntary withdrawal of a Partner from the Partnership will include but not be limited to: death of a Partner; Partner mental incapacity; Partner disability preventing reasonable participation in the Partnership; Partner incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Partner; criminal conviction of a Partner; Expulsion of a Partner; Operation of Law against a Partner; or any act or omission of a Partner that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Partnership into disrepute.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A trustee in bankruptcy or similar third party who may acquire that Dissociated Partner's interest in the Partnership will only acquire that Partner's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Partner or be admitted as a Partner of the Partnership or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Dissociation of a Partner

Where the dissociation of a Partner for any reason results in the dissolution of the Partnership then the Partnership will proceed in a reasonable and timely manner to dissolve the Partnership, with all debts being paid first, prior to any distribution of the remaining funds. Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

The remaining Partners retain the right to seek damages from a Dissociated Partner where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the Dissociated Partner or where the Dissociated Partner had breached their fiduciary duty to the Partnership or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Partnership or to the reputation of the Partnership.

Dissolution

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Partnership may be dissolved only with the unanimous consent of all Partners.

Distribution of Property on Dissolution of Partnership

In the event of the dissolution of the Partnership, each Partner will share equally (the "Dissolution Distribution") in any remaining assets or liabilities of the Partnership.

Upon Dissolution of the Partnership and liquidation of Partnership Property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Partnership assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Partnership obligations to current Partners;

in satisfaction of Partnership debt obligations to current Partners; and then

to the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.



The claims of each priority group will be satisfied in full before satisfying any claims of a lower priority group. Any excess of Partnership assets after liabilities or any insufficiency in Partnership assets in resolving liabilities under this section will be shared by the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Partnership will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Partnership assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Partners. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Partners. A withdrawing Partner's interest will be based on that Partner's proportion of the Dissolution Distribution described above, less any outstanding liabilities the withdrawing Partner may have to the Partnership. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Partnership despite the withdrawal of any individual Partner.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Partnership books immediately prior to valuation.

Goodwill

The goodwill of the Partnership business will be assessed at an amount to be determined by appraisal using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Title to Partnership Property

Title to all Partnership Property will remain in the name of the Partnership. No Partner or group of Partners will have any ownership interest in such Partnership Property in whole or in part.

Voting

Any vote required by the Partnership will be assessed where each Partner receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Force Majeure

A Partner will be free of liability to the Partnership where the Partner is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure, such as earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event where the Partner has communicated the circumstance of said event to any and all other Partners and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate said event.

Duty of Loyalty

No Partner will engage in any business, venture or transaction, whether directly or indirectly, that might be competitive with the business of the Partnership or that would be in direct conflict of interest to the Partnership without the unanimous written consent of the remaining Partners. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Partners. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this clause will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Duty of Accountability for Private Profits

Each Partner must account to the Partnership for any benefit derived by that Partner without the consent of the other Partners from any transaction concerning the Partnership or any use by that Partner of the Partnership property, name or business connection. This duty continues to apply to any transactions undertaken after the Partnership has been dissolved but before the affairs of the Partnership have been completely wound up by the surviving Partner or Partners or their agent or agents.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Partner will devote such time and attention to the business of the Partnership as the majority of the Partners will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Partnership business.

No Partner may do any act in contravention of this Agreement.

No Partner may permit, intentionally or unintentionally, the assignment of express, implied or apparent authority to a third party that is not a Partner in the Partnership.

No Partner may confess a judgment against the Partnership.

No Partner will have the right or authority to bind or obligate the Partnership to any extent with regard to any matter outside the intended purpose of the Partnership.

Any violation of the above Forbidden Acts will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Indemnification

All Partners will be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all claims of any nature, whatsoever, arising out of a Partner's participation in Partnership affairs. A Partner will not be entitled to indemnification under this section for liability arising out of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Partner or the breach by the Partner of any provisions of this Agreement.

Life Insurance

The Partnership will have the right to acquire life insurance on the lives of any or all of the Partners, whenever it is deemed necessary by the Partnership. Each Partner will cooperate fully with the Partnership in obtaining any such policies of life insurance.

Meetings

Any Partner can call a special meeting to resolve issues that require a vote, as indicated by this Agreement, by providing all Partners with reasonable notice. In the case of a special vote, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was held.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Partners.

Admitting a New Partner

A new Partner may only be admitted to the Partnership with a majority vote of the existing Partners.

Any new Partner agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Partner will execute such documents as are needed to effect the admission of the new Partner. Any new Partner will receive such business interest in the Partnership as determined by a unanimous decision of the other Partners.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Any Partner will have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership at any time. Written notice of intention to withdraw must be served upon the remaining Partners at least three (3) months prior to the withdrawal date.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A Dissociated Partner will only exercise the right to withdraw in good faith and will act to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Partners as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Events resulting in the involuntary withdrawal of a Partner from the Partnership will include but not be limited to: death of a Partner; Partner mental incapacity; Partner disability preventing reasonable participation in the Partnership; Partner incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Partner; criminal conviction of a Partner; Expulsion of a Partner; Operation of Law against a Partner; or any act or omission of a Partner that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Partnership into disrepute.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A trustee in bankruptcy or similar third party who may acquire that Dissociated Partner's interest in the Partnership will only acquire that Partner's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Partner or be admitted as a Partner of the Partnership or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Dissociation of a Partner

Where the dissociation of a Partner for any reason results in the dissolution of the Partnership then the Partnership will proceed in a reasonable and timely manner to dissolve the Partnership, with all debts being paid first, prior to any distribution of the remaining funds. Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

The remaining Partners retain the right to seek damages from a Dissociated Partner where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the Dissociated Partner or where the Dissociated Partner had breached their fiduciary duty to the Partnership or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Partnership or to the reputation of the Partnership.

Dissolution

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Partnership may be dissolved only with the unanimous consent of all Partners.

Distribution of Property on Dissolution of Partnership

In the event of the dissolution of the Partnership, each Partner will share equally (the "Dissolution Distribution") in any remaining assets or liabilities of the Partnership.

Upon Dissolution of the Partnership and liquidation of Partnership Property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Partnership assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Partnership obligations to current Partners;

in satisfaction of Partnership debt obligations to current Partners; and then

to the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.



The claims of each priority group will be satisfied in full before satisfying any claims of a lower priority group. Any excess of Partnership assets after liabilities or any insufficiency in Partnership assets in resolving liabilities under this section will be shared by the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Partnership will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Partnership assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Partners. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Partners. A withdrawing Partner's interest will be based on that Partner's proportion of the Dissolution Distribution described above, less any outstanding liabilities the withdrawing Partner may have to the Partnership. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Partnership despite the withdrawal of any individual Partner.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Partnership books immediately prior to valuation.

Goodwill

The goodwill of the Partnership business will be assessed at an amount to be determined by appraisal using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Title to Partnership Property

Title to all Partnership Property will remain in the name of the Partnership. No Partner or group of Partners will have any ownership interest in such Partnership Property in whole or in part.

Voting

Any vote required by the Partnership will be assessed where each Partner receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Force Majeure

A Partner will be free of liability to the Partnership where the Partner is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure, such as earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event where the Partner has communicated the circumstance of said event to any and all other Partners and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate said event.

Duty of Loyalty

No Partner will engage in any business, venture or transaction, whether directly or indirectly, that might be competitive with the business of the Partnership or that would be in direct conflict of interest to the Partnership without the unanimous written consent of the remaining Partners. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Partners. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this clause will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Duty of Accountability for Private Profits

Each Partner must account to the Partnership for any benefit derived by that Partner without the consent of the other Partners from any transaction concerning the Partnership or any use by that Partner of the Partnership property, name or business connection. This duty continues to apply to any transactions undertaken after the Partnership has been dissolved but before the affairs of the Partnership have been completely wound up by the surviving Partner or Partners or their agent or agents.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Partner will devote such time and attention to the business of the Partnership as the majority of the Partners will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Partnership business.

Forbidden Acts

No Partner may do any act in contravention of this Agreement.

No Partner may permit, intentionally or unintentionally, the assignment of express, implied or apparent authority to a third party that is not a Partner in the Partnership.

No Partner may do any act that would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership.

No Partner may confess a judgment against the Partnership.

No Partner will have the right or authority to bind or obligate the Partnership to any extent with regard to any matter outside the intended purpose of the Partnership.

Any violation of the above Forbidden Acts will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Indemnification

All Partners will be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all claims of any nature, whatsoever, arising out of a Partner's participation in Partnership affairs. A Partner will not be entitled to indemnification under this section for liability arising out of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Partner or the breach by the Partner of any provisions of this Agreement.

Liability

A Partner will not be liable to the Partnership, or to any other Partner, for any mistake or error in judgment or for any act or omission done in good faith and believed to be within the scope of authority conferred or implied by this Agreement or the Partnership.

Liability Insurance

The Partnership may acquire insurance on behalf of any Partner, employee, agent or other person engaged in the business interest of the Partnership against any liability asserted against them or incurred by them while acting in good faith on behalf of the Partnership.

Life Insurance

The Partnership will have the right to acquire life insurance on the lives of any or all of the Partners, whenever it is deemed necessary by the Partnership. Each Partner will cooperate fully with the Partnership in obtaining any such policies of life insurance.

Amendments

This Agreement may not be amended in whole or in part without the unanimous written consent of all Partners.

The Partners submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of The State of Alabama for the enforcement of this Agreement or any arbitration award or decision arising from this Agreement.

What is a Partnership Agreement?
A partnership agreement is a contract between two or more business partners that is used to establish the responsibilities, and profit and loss distribution of each partner, as well as other rules about the general partnership.
Who needs a Partnership Agreement?
Any two or more people who run a for-profit business together, including family (spouses), friends or colleagues, should have a Partnership Agreement.
Types of Partnerships
General Partnership: A general partnership is a business structure involving two or more general partners who have formed a business for profit. Each partner is equally liable for the debts and obligations of the business, as well as the actions of the other partner(s).
Limited Partnership: A limited partnership includes at least one general partner who has unlimited liability in the company and a limited partner who is only liable for his or her portion of ownership.
Limited Liability Partnership: A limited liability partnership is a type of partnership in which each partner is only liable for his or her own actions.
What is included in a Partnership Agreement?
The partnership contract includes information about the business itself, business partners, profit and loss distribution, as well as management, voting methods, withdrawal and dissolution.
Capital Contribution
Each partner receives a percentage of ownership based on his or her capital contribution.
Profit and Loss Distribution
As agreed to by partners, profits and losses can be distributed by:

Fixed Percent: This number is a fixed percentage (e.g. 45, 55). The numbers must add up to 100% between all partners.
Equal Share: Profits and losses are distributed evenly between partners.

Management and Voting
Partnerships can be managed by a designated managing partner or through majority voting by all partners.
Voting can be carried out through three possible methods:

Proportional to Contributions: Voting powers reflect each partner's capital contribution.
Proportional to Profit Share: Voting powers are assigned according to profit distribution.
Equal Vote: Voting power is equal, and each partner is assigned one vote.

Partnership Withdrawal
If the partner contract permits withdrawal, a partner may make an amicable exit so long as he or she is adhering to the notice period, probation period, and other terms specified in the agreement.
There are two forms of partnership withdrawal:

Voluntary: A general partner decides to leave the business for personal reasons, such as retirement.
Non-voluntary: A partner exits from the partnership against his or her consent, such as through incarceration or death.

Partners may indicate how assets are distributed between partners in the event of dissolution.

$0.00 USD
						




All Partners will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Partner will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Partners.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Partnership provided that the interests of the Partners are not affected, except with the unanimous consent of the Partners. No Partner will be required to make Additional Capital Contributions. Whenever additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Partner is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, as required by Partnership business obligations, remaining Partners may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case the allocation of profits or losses among all the Partners will be adjusted to reflect the aggregate change in Capital Contributions by the Partners.

Any advance of money to the Partnership by any Partner in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt owed by the Partnership and not an increase in Capital Contribution of the Partner. This liability will be repaid with interest at rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Partners within the limits of what is required or permitted in the Act. This liability will not entitle the lending Partner to any increased share of the Partnership's profits nor to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Partners as may be determined by a majority of the Partners.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Accounts") will be maintained for each Partner and their Initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any Additional Capital Contributions made by any Partner will be credited to that Partner's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Partner on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Capital Contributions.

Financial Decisions

Decisions regarding the distribution of profits, allocation of losses, and the requirement for Additional Capital Contributions as well as all other financial matters will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Profit and Loss

Subject to any other provisions of this Agreement, the net profits and losses of the Partnership, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the Partners in equal proportions (the "Profit and Loss Distribution").

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Partnership will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Partner. The books and records of the Partnership will reflect all the Partnership’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Partnership.

Annual Report

As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Partnership will furnish to each Partner an annual report showing a full and complete account of the condition of the Partnership. This report will consist of at least the following documents:

a statement of all information as will be necessary for the preparation of each Partner's income or other tax returns;

a copy of the Partnership's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year; and

any additional information that the Partners may require.



Banking and Partnership Funds

The funds of the Partnership will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Partners.  Partnership funds will be held in the name of the Partnership and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Fiscal Year

The fiscal year will end on the ______ day of ________________ of each year.

Audit

Any of the Partners will have the right to request an audit of the Partnership books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Partnership. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Partners. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Partners for any fiscal year.

Management

Except as all of the Partners may otherwise agree in writing, all actions and decisions respecting the management, operation and control of the Partnership and its business will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Contract Binding Authority

Each Partner will have authority to bind the Partnership in contract.

Tax Matters Partner

The tax matters partner will be ____________________________ (the "Tax Matters Partner"). The Tax Matters Partner will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all tax returns and reports for the Partnership and make any related elections that the Partners deem advisable.

A Tax Matters Partner can voluntarily withdraw from the position of Tax Matters Partner or can be appointed or replaced by a majority vote of the other Partners. In the event of a withdrawal of the Tax Matters Partner from the Partnership, the remaining Partners will appoint a successor as soon as practicable.

Meetings

Regular meetings of the Partners will be held as required.

Any Partner can call a special meeting to resolve issues that require a vote, as indicated by this Agreement, by providing all Partners with reasonable notice. In the case of a special vote, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was held.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Partners.

Admitting a New Partner

A new Partner may only be admitted to the Partnership with a majority vote of the existing Partners.

Any new Partner agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Partner will execute such documents as are needed to effect the admission of the new Partner. Any new Partner will receive such business interest in the Partnership as determined by a unanimous decision of the other Partners.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Any Partner will have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership at any time. Written notice of intention to withdraw must be served upon the remaining Partners at least three (3) months prior to the withdrawal date.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A Dissociated Partner will only exercise the right to withdraw in good faith and will act to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Partners as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Events resulting in the involuntary withdrawal of a Partner from the Partnership will include but not be limited to: death of a Partner; Partner mental incapacity; Partner disability preventing reasonable participation in the Partnership; Partner incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Partner; criminal conviction of a Partner; Expulsion of a Partner; Operation of Law against a Partner; or any act or omission of a Partner that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Partnership into disrepute.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A trustee in bankruptcy or similar third party who may acquire that Dissociated Partner's interest in the Partnership will only acquire that Partner's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Partner or be admitted as a Partner of the Partnership or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Dissociation of a Partner

Where the dissociation of a Partner for any reason results in the dissolution of the Partnership then the Partnership will proceed in a reasonable and timely manner to dissolve the Partnership, with all debts being paid first, prior to any distribution of the remaining funds. Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

The remaining Partners retain the right to seek damages from a Dissociated Partner where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the Dissociated Partner or where the Dissociated Partner had breached their fiduciary duty to the Partnership or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Partnership or to the reputation of the Partnership.

Dissolution

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Partnership may be dissolved only with the unanimous consent of all Partners.

Distribution of Property on Dissolution of Partnership

In the event of the dissolution of the Partnership, each Partner will share equally (the "Dissolution Distribution") in any remaining assets or liabilities of the Partnership.

Upon Dissolution of the Partnership and liquidation of Partnership Property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Partnership assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Partnership obligations to current Partners;

in satisfaction of Partnership debt obligations to current Partners; and then

to the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.



The claims of each priority group will be satisfied in full before satisfying any claims of a lower priority group. Any excess of Partnership assets after liabilities or any insufficiency in Partnership assets in resolving liabilities under this section will be shared by the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Partnership will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Partnership assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Partners. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Partners. A withdrawing Partner's interest will be based on that Partner's proportion of the Dissolution Distribution described above, less any outstanding liabilities the withdrawing Partner may have to the Partnership. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Partnership despite the withdrawal of any individual Partner.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Partnership books immediately prior to valuation.

Goodwill

The goodwill of the Partnership business will be assessed at an amount to be determined by appraisal using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Title to Partnership Property

Title to all Partnership Property will remain in the name of the Partnership. No Partner or group of Partners will have any ownership interest in such Partnership Property in whole or in part.

Voting

Any vote required by the Partnership will be assessed where each Partner receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Force Majeure

General Partnership Agreement
Partnership Contract
Articles of Partnership
Business Partnership Agreement

What is a Partnership Agreement?
A partnership agreement is a contract between two or more business partners that is used to establish the responsibilities, and profit and loss distribution of each partner, as well as other rules about the general partnership.
Who needs a Partnership Agreement?
Any two or more people who run a for-profit business together, including family (spouses), friends or colleagues, should have a Partnership Agreement.
Types of Partnerships
General Partnership: A general partnership is a business structure involving two or more general partners who have formed a business for profit. Each partner is equally liable for the debts and obligations of the business, as well as the actions of the other partner(s).
Limited Partnership: A limited partnership includes at least one general partner who has unlimited liability in the company and a limited partner who is only liable for his or her portion of ownership.
Limited Liability Partnership: A limited liability partnership is a type of partnership in which each partner is only liable for his or her own actions.
What is included in a Partnership Agreement?
The partnership contract includes information about the business itself, business partners, profit and loss distribution, as well as management, voting methods, withdrawal and dissolution.
Capital Contribution
Each partner receives a percentage of ownership based on his or her capital contribution.
Profit and Loss Distribution
As agreed to by partners, profits and losses can be distributed by:

Fixed Percent: This number is a fixed percentage (e.g. 45, 55). The numbers must add up to 100% between all partners.
Equal Share: Profits and losses are distributed evenly between partners.

Management and Voting
Partnerships can be managed by a designated managing partner or through majority voting by all partners.
Voting can be carried out through three possible methods:

Proportional to Contributions: Voting powers reflect each partner's capital contribution.
Proportional to Profit Share: Voting powers are assigned according to profit distribution.
Equal Vote: Voting power is equal, and each partner is assigned one vote.

Partnership Withdrawal
If the partner contract permits withdrawal, a partner may make an amicable exit so long as he or she is adhering to the notice period, probation period, and other terms specified in the agreement.
There are two forms of partnership withdrawal:

Voluntary: A general partner decides to leave the business for personal reasons, such as retirement.
Non-voluntary: A partner exits from the partnership against his or her consent, such as through incarceration or death.

Partnership Dissolution
Partners may indicate how assets are distributed between partners in the event of dissolution.
Potential ways a partnership may be dissolved:

All partners agree on a specified end date
All projects have been completed or the purpose of the partnership has been fulfilled
Upon death of a partner
Bankruptcy of a partner or the partnership
A partner withdraws

Related Documents:

Notice of Withdrawal from Partnership: A notice used to inform partners of the intended withdrawal of a partner from a business partnership. 
Assignment of Partnership Interest: Used to transfer partnership interest from one partner to another.

Joint Venture Agreement: A document used to spell out the details in which two parties unite resources for a common goal or project.

IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Partners entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:
	

Formation

Agreed Value

$0.00 USD
						




All Partners will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Partner will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Partners.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Partnership provided that the interests of the Partners are not affected, except with the unanimous consent of the Partners. No Partner will be required to make Additional Capital Contributions. Whenever additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Partner is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, as required by Partnership business obligations, remaining Partners may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case the allocation of profits or losses among all the Partners will be adjusted to reflect the aggregate change in Capital Contributions by the Partners.

Any advance of money to the Partnership by any Partner in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt owed by the Partnership and not an increase in Capital Contribution of the Partner. This liability will be repaid with interest at rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Partners within the limits of what is required or permitted in the Act. This liability will not entitle the lending Partner to any increased share of the Partnership's profits nor to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Partners as may be determined by a majority of the Partners.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Accounts") will be maintained for each Partner and their Initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any Additional Capital Contributions made by any Partner will be credited to that Partner's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Partner on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Capital Contributions.

Financial Decisions

Decisions regarding the distribution of profits, allocation of losses, and the requirement for Additional Capital Contributions as well as all other financial matters will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Profit and Loss

Subject to any other provisions of this Agreement, the net profits and losses of the Partnership, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the Partners in equal proportions (the "Profit and Loss Distribution").

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Partnership will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Partner. The books and records of the Partnership will reflect all the Partnership’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Partnership.

Annual Report

As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Partnership will furnish to each Partner an annual report showing a full and complete account of the condition of the Partnership. This report will consist of at least the following documents:

a statement of all information as will be necessary for the preparation of each Partner's income or other tax returns;

a copy of the Partnership's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year; and

any additional information that the Partners may require.



Banking and Partnership Funds

The funds of the Partnership will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Partners.  Partnership funds will be held in the name of the Partnership and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Fiscal Year

The fiscal year will end on the ______ day of ________________ of each year.

Audit

Any of the Partners will have the right to request an audit of the Partnership books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Partnership. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Partners. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Partners for any fiscal year.

Management

Except as all of the Partners may otherwise agree in writing, all actions and decisions respecting the management, operation and control of the Partnership and its business will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Contract Binding Authority

Each Partner will have authority to bind the Partnership in contract.

Tax Matters Partner

The tax matters partner will be ____________________________ (the "Tax Matters Partner"). The Tax Matters Partner will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all tax returns and reports for the Partnership and make any related elections that the Partners deem advisable.

A Tax Matters Partner can voluntarily withdraw from the position of Tax Matters Partner or can be appointed or replaced by a majority vote of the other Partners. In the event of a withdrawal of the Tax Matters Partner from the Partnership, the remaining Partners will appoint a successor as soon as practicable.

Meetings

Regular meetings of the Partners will be held as required.

Any Partner can call a special meeting to resolve issues that require a vote, as indicated by this Agreement, by providing all Partners with reasonable notice. In the case of a special vote, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was held.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Partners.

Admitting a New Partner

A new Partner may only be admitted to the Partnership with a majority vote of the existing Partners.

Any new Partner agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Partner will execute such documents as are needed to effect the admission of the new Partner. Any new Partner will receive such business interest in the Partnership as determined by a unanimous decision of the other Partners.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Any Partner will have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership at any time. Written notice of intention to withdraw must be served upon the remaining Partners at least three (3) months prior to the withdrawal date.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A Dissociated Partner will only exercise the right to withdraw in good faith and will act to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Partners as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Events resulting in the involuntary withdrawal of a Partner from the Partnership will include but not be limited to: death of a Partner; Partner mental incapacity; Partner disability preventing reasonable participation in the Partnership; Partner incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Partner; criminal conviction of a Partner; Expulsion of a Partner; Operation of Law against a Partner; or any act or omission of a Partner that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Partnership into disrepute.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A trustee in bankruptcy or similar third party who may acquire that Dissociated Partner's interest in the Partnership will only acquire that Partner's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Partner or be admitted as a Partner of the Partnership or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Dissociation of a Partner

Where the dissociation of a Partner for any reason results in the dissolution of the Partnership then the Partnership will proceed in a reasonable and timely manner to dissolve the Partnership, with all debts being paid first, prior to any distribution of the remaining funds. Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

The remaining Partners retain the right to seek damages from a Dissociated Partner where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the Dissociated Partner or where the Dissociated Partner had breached their fiduciary duty to the Partnership or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Partnership or to the reputation of the Partnership.

Dissolution

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Partnership may be dissolved only with the unanimous consent of all Partners.

Distribution of Property on Dissolution of Partnership

In the event of the dissolution of the Partnership, each Partner will share equally (the "Dissolution Distribution") in any remaining assets or liabilities of the Partnership.

Upon Dissolution of the Partnership and liquidation of Partnership Property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Partnership assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Partnership obligations to current Partners;

in satisfaction of Partnership debt obligations to current Partners; and then

to the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.



The claims of each priority group will be satisfied in full before satisfying any claims of a lower priority group. Any excess of Partnership assets after liabilities or any insufficiency in Partnership assets in resolving liabilities under this section will be shared by the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Partnership will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Partnership assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Partners. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Partners. A withdrawing Partner's interest will be based on that Partner's proportion of the Dissolution Distribution described above, less any outstanding liabilities the withdrawing Partner may have to the Partnership. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Partnership despite the withdrawal of any individual Partner.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Partnership books immediately prior to valuation.

Goodwill

The goodwill of the Partnership business will be assessed at an amount to be determined by appraisal using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Title to Partnership Property

Title to all Partnership Property will remain in the name of the Partnership. No Partner or group of Partners will have any ownership interest in such Partnership Property in whole or in part.

Voting

Any vote required by the Partnership will be assessed where each Partner receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Force Majeure

A Partner will be free of liability to the Partnership where the Partner is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure, such as earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event where the Partner has communicated the circumstance of said event to any and all other Partners and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate said event.

Duty of Loyalty

No Partner will engage in any business, venture or transaction, whether directly or indirectly, that might be competitive with the business of the Partnership or that would be in direct conflict of interest to the Partnership without the unanimous written consent of the remaining Partners. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Partners. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this clause will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Duty of Accountability for Private Profits

Each Partner must account to the Partnership for any benefit derived by that Partner without the consent of the other Partners from any transaction concerning the Partnership or any use by that Partner of the Partnership property, name or business connection. This duty continues to apply to any transactions undertaken after the Partnership has been dissolved but before the affairs of the Partnership have been completely wound up by the surviving Partner or Partners or their agent or agents.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Partner will devote such time and attention to the business of the Partnership as the majority of the Partners will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Partnership business.

Forbidden Acts

No Partner may do any act in contravention of this Agreement.

No Partner may permit, intentionally or unintentionally, the assignment of express, implied or apparent authority to a third party that is not a Partner in the Partnership.

No Partner may confess a judgment against the Partnership.

No Partner will have the right or authority to bind or obligate the Partnership to any extent with regard to any matter outside the intended purpose of the Partnership.

Any violation of the above Forbidden Acts will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Indemnification

All Partners will be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all claims of any nature, whatsoever, arising out of a Partner's participation in Partnership affairs. A Partner will not be entitled to indemnification under this section for liability arising out of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Partner or the breach by the Partner of any provisions of this Agreement.

Liability

A Partner will not be liable to the Partnership, or to any other Partner, for any mistake or error in judgment or for any act or omission done in good faith and believed to be within the scope of authority conferred or implied by this Agreement or the Partnership.

Partnership Agreement
Alternate Names:
A Partnership Agreement is also known as:

General Partnership Agreement
Partnership Contract
Articles of Partnership
Business Partnership Agreement

What is a Partnership Agreement?
A partnership agreement is a contract between two or more business partners that is used to establish the responsibilities, and profit and loss distribution of each partner, as well as other rules about the general partnership.
Who needs a Partnership Agreement?
Any two or more people who run a for-profit business together, including family (spouses), friends or colleagues, should have a Partnership Agreement.
Types of Partnerships
General Partnership: A general partnership is a business structure involving two or more general partners who have formed a business for profit. Each partner is equally liable for the debts and obligations of the business, as well as the actions of the other partner(s).
Limited Partnership: A limited partnership includes at least one general partner who has unlimited liability in the company and a limited partner who is only liable for his or her portion of ownership.
Limited Liability Partnership: A limited liability partnership is a type of partnership in which each partner is only liable for his or her own actions.
What is included in a Partnership Agreement?
The partnership contract includes information about the business itself, business partners, profit and loss distribution, as well as management, voting methods, withdrawal and dissolution.
Capital Contribution
Each partner receives a percentage of ownership based on his or her capital contribution.
Profit and Loss Distribution
As agreed to by partners, profits and losses can be distributed by:

Fixed Percent: This number is a fixed percentage (e.g. 45, 55). The numbers must add up to 100% between all partners.
Equal Share: Profits and losses are distributed evenly between partners.

Management and Voting
Partnerships can be managed by a designated managing partner or through majority voting by all partners.
Voting can be carried out through three possible methods:

Proportional to Contributions: Voting powers reflect each partner's capital contribution.
Proportional to Profit Share: Voting powers are assigned according to profit distribution.
Equal Vote: Voting power is equal, and each partner is assigned one vote.

Partnership Withdrawal
If the partner contract permits withdrawal, a partner may make an amicable exit so long as he or she is adhering to the notice period, probation period, and other terms specified in the agreement.
There are two forms of partnership withdrawal:

Voluntary: A general partner decides to leave the business for personal reasons, such as retirement.
Non-voluntary: A partner exits from the partnership against his or her consent, such as through incarceration or death.

Partnership Dissolution
Partners may indicate how assets are distributed between partners in the event of dissolution.
Potential ways a partnership may be dissolved:

All partners agree on a specified end date
All projects have been completed or the purpose of the partnership has been fulfilled
Upon death of a partner
Bankruptcy of a partner or the partnership
A partner withdraws

Related Documents:

Notice of Withdrawal from Partnership: A notice used to inform partners of the intended withdrawal of a partner from a business partnership. 
Assignment of Partnership Interest: Used to transfer partnership interest from one partner to another.
Partnership Amending Agreement: Used to amend or modify the terms of a partnership agreement.
Joint Venture Agreement: A document used to spell out the details in which two parties unite resources for a common goal or project.
LLC Operating Agreement: Similar to a partnership contract, an LLC Operating Agreement outlines the rights and responsibilities of its members and establishes the rules and operating details for a limited liability company. 
Business Plan: A comprehensive document defining a company's mission, values, goals, marketing and sales plan, financial projections, employee and management information.

					Common Questions
What is a Partnership?A partnership  is a form of business organization in which two or more individuals (partners) manage and operate the business with a view to making a profit. Each partner shares a fixed proportion of the partnership profits and losses.What is the difference between a General Partnership and other types of partnerships?A General Partnership is a business model consisting of two or more persons (general partners) where each partner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the partnership (joint and several liability). Each partner is responsible for the outcome of any legal action (lawsuit) regardless of whether the partner was personally involved in the actions that led to the lawsuit. LegalContracts.com's Partnership Agreement is designed for use with a General Partnership.A Limited Partnership consists of at least one General Partner as well as one or more Limited Partners. Similar to a General Partnership, the General Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. The liability of a Limited Partner is limited to the amount of capital they contributed to the partnership.In a Limited-Liability Partnership , each partner is only liable for their own actions (and the acts of employees under their direct supervision) and not for the negligent acts of other partners. Limited-Liability Partnerships are commonly used by accounting firms and law firms.What is a Partnership Agreement?A partnership agreement is an agreement between two or more persons (partners) setting out the terms and conditions under which they will operate a for-profit business partnership. The partnership agreement will describe the cash contribution requirements for each partner, the distribution of profits and losses between partners, as well as other duties and obligations. The general partnership agreement does not have to be filed or registered.What partnership name should I use?The name of the Partnership should be distinguishable from the name of any other existing business entity (corporation, partnership, LLC, etc.). If you pick a name that is too similar to an existing business you may be asked to change it. A corporate name search is recommended.

					Common Questions
What is the fiscal year?The fiscal year is a 12-month accounting period of business operations beginning at any date. A company can schedule their fiscal year-end to coincide with a less busy time of the business year. A retail company that is very busy during the holiday season may elect to have a non-calendar fiscal year-end during a less busy period. That way they will have time to count inventories and prepare financial statements with minimal interference from the busy holiday season.What is the difference between Cash method and Accrual method of accounting?Cash: A method of recording earnings and expenses only upon receipt or payment without regard to when they occurred or were incurred.Accrual: A method of recording earnings and expenses as they occur or are incurred, without regard to the actual date of collection or payment.What is Goodwill?Goodwill is the value of a business beyond the market value of its assets. It is a reflection of the Company's competitive advantage through reputation,  location, brand name, and good customer service. Goodwill may include other intangible assets such as patents or proprietary technology. Goodwill is usually determined by generally accepted accounting methods.What is a Tax Matters Partner?The Tax Matters Partner is the Partner selected by the Partnership  to represent the company to the Internal Revenue Service and to make decisions on behalf of the Partnership concerning taxation issues. The Internal Revenue Code requires that the company designate a Partner for this purpose.The Tax Matters Partner prepares and submits all tax returns and reports as required by the taxation legislation.Why does the annual report always include the federal income tax report?The annual report will always include the federal income tax report because each Partner will need that information to file their personal income tax. The Partnership itself does not usually pay income tax. Partnership income passes un-taxed to the Partners in the form of a distribution or dividend which is then taxed as personal income.

					Common Questions
How can the Partnership be managed?The day-to-day management of the company can be performed by an individual Managing Partner or through the equitable participation of all Partners through majority votes where necessary. Note that where there is a Managing Partner, many substantial issues will still be resolved by a vote of all Partners.What is a managing partner?A partnership may have a managing partner who is responsible for managing the business. The managing partner will make all the day-to-day decisions of the partnership. All partners in a general partnership will have the right to participate in the management and control of the partnership unless the management obligations are delegated to one or more managing partners in the partnership agreement.What is meant by binding the Partnership in contract?In general, each Partner is deemed to be an agent of the company and each Partner is therefore able to commit the company to business contracts that are within the normal business activities of the company.In general, it is good practice to specify who has authority to bind the company in contract and then to ensure that all customers and suppliers have knowledge of who has authority and who does not.

 (eg. 51, 100, etc.)



Percent vote required to amend any part of this Agreement:

 (eg. 51, 100, etc.)





					Common Questions
Why require minimum voting levels?The rights of all Partners, including minority Partners, need to be respected. Some business decisions can substantially change the nature of the business, possibly greatly increasing the risk to individual Partners. In general, all Partners should have a voice in any decisions that could substantially affect their business interests.What are the voting methods?On issues where Partners are required to vote, voting may be proportional to each Partner's relative Capital Contribution or proportional to each Partner's relative profit entitlement or there may be an equal vote where each Partner gets one vote.Even though the Partnership will be managed day-to-day by a Managing Partner there will still be substantial issues that require a vote of the Partners. 




					Actions Requiring Unanimous Consent
				
Select the issues that require the unanimous consent of all Partners:


Incurring Partnership liabilities over a fixed amount.
All Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the Partnership. Where expansion of the Partnership requires a significant financial investment involving a large debt load, the interests of all Partners must be considered before proceeding with that additional risk.


Single liability expense limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Incurring single transaction expenses over a fixed amount.
All Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the Partnership. To protect the interests of all Partners, the unanimous consent of all Partners may be required when making substantial purchases.


Single transaction expense limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Sale of any Partnership asset with fair market value over a fixed amount.
Sale of significant Partnership assets should require the unanimous consent of all Partners so that the interests of all Partners are protected. An individual Partner should not be permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership property. An individual Partner should also not be allowed to use Partnership property as collateral for a loan (either a personal loan or a Partnership loan).


Fair market value limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Hiring an employee with annual salary over a fixed amount.

Annual salary limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Firing of any employee.



Releasing any Partnership claim except for payment in full.
Where the Partnership has a claim against another person or business entity or where a debt is owed to the Partnership, it is in the best interest of the Partnership and the individual Partners if these obligations owed to the Partnership are paid in full. If an obligation is to be released for less than full consideration it is important that the interests of all Partners are considered.




Assignment of ownership rights of Partnership property.
Individual Partners do not have property rights in Partnership property. In order to protect the interests of all Partners from unauthorized behavior involving Partnership property, the Partners may want to have more control over the use, lending and sale of Partnership property.




Endangering the ownership or possession of Partnership property.
Individual Partners do not have property rights in Partnership property. The interests of all Partners must be considered where Partnership assets are put at risk either by loaning to a third party or placing the asset in an environment where the asset is subjected to theft or loss.




Assignment of check signing authority.




					Common Questions
Why require unanimous consent?In general, business decisions will be resolved by a majority vote of the Partners. However where the impact on individual Partners will be significant, the Partnership may wish to resolve these decisions through a unanimous vote in order to protect the interests of all Partners.What is meant by "Incurring liabilities or expenditures over a fixed amount"?Where normal operations or an extraordinary expansion of the Partnership requires a significant financial investment involving additional expenses or a large debt load, the interests of all Partners must be respected and the unanimous consent of all Partners may be required before proceeding with that risk. Undertaking modest expenses may be resolved with a simple majority vote however, incurring expenses over a certain amount should require a unanimous vote. You will be asked to enter an amount. Any expenditures over that amount will require the unanimous consent of all Partners.

Initial period of prohibition on withdrawal:


									Not Required
								
									Three Months

					Common Questions
Why have a period of prohibition on withdrawal?Partners in a Partnership have a duty to act in the best interest of the Partnership and each other. By enforcing a prohibition on withdrawal, individuals will be motivated to take their responsibility as a Partner seriously and commit to at least a minimum period with the Partnership. The other Partners can then feel comfortable relying on the commitment of their fellow Partners to the purpose and goals of the Partnership.Where a Partner withdraws prior to the end of the initial period of prohibition, that Partner may be subject to penalties that reasonably reflect the damages done to the Partnership by that early withdrawal including, but not limited to, lost Partnership earnings.How does a partnership end?The Partnership can end by agreement of the Partners or the Partners can expressly agree that the Partnership will end at a specified date, or upon completion of certain tasks. In some jurisdictions the Partnership may end on the death or bankruptcy of a Partner unless the Partnership Agreement expressly states otherwise.How does a partner leave?Where there is no Partnership Agreement, the Partners can make a written submission to the other Partners to withdraw from the Partnership. A Partnership Agreement should protect the Partnership and the remaining Partners from the unexpected withdrawal of an essential Partner. If the voluntary withdrawal of a Partner offends a term of the Partnership Agreement, then the withdrawing Partner may be liable for any damages suffered by the Partnership or the remaining Partners.Can a partner transfer their interest?Yes, a Partner can transfer their interest in the Partnership, if the Partnership agreement does not restrict a transfer. If an individual Partner becomes bankrupt then a third party may have a claim against that Partner's interest in the Partnership. However, depending on the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the recipient of a transferred interest may not be given any power to vote or to participate in decision-making. The rights and obligations of a recipient of a Partnership interest may be limited to the profits and losses of the Partnership. This is to ensure that the remaining Partners are not affected by the extravagance or incompatible notions of an unexpected new Partner.How can assets be distributed on dissolution?When a Partnership is dissolved, the proceeds from the sale of the assets may be distributed among the Partners either in proportion to their respective capital contributions or in proportion to the designated profit/loss sharing ratios.Note: The distribution method on dissolution may be different from the method used for ongoing profit and loss distribution. For example, to get the Partnership started, one Partner may provide technical expertise while another Partner provides cash. They may share ongoing profits on a 50/50 basis but in the event of the dissolution  of the company the cash investor may expect to get back 100% of his cash investment.




					Duty of Loyalty
				
Can Partners participate in activities that compete with the Partnership?


Yes

No






After leaving, a Partner cannot compete against the Partnership for:


								Three Months
							
								Six Months
							
								One Year
							
								Two Years
							
								Three Years
							
								Four Years
							
								Five Years
							
								Ten Years
							





					Common Questions
What is the Duty of Loyalty?Partners owe each other, and the Partnership, a fiduciary duty. Unless permitted in the Partnership Agreement, a Partner cannot compete with the Partnership by participating in a similar business in the same geographical area, and cannot take opportunities for themself that the Partnership may want to pursue, nor act either willfully or recklessly in a manner that will harm the Partnership. After leaving, why can't a partner compete?Where the Partner or manager leaves for any reason and the Partnership survives the dissociation, it will be in the best interest of the Partnership to prevent dissociated Partners or managers from participating in competing ventures. It is presumed that a Partner or manager has had access to confidential information while working at the Partnership. It would be unfair to use that information to participate in a competing venture.

					Common Questions
How should I refer to people and terms in the clause?Do not use several names or words to refer to the same person or thing as it could cause confusion and ambiguity by appearing to introduce new or different people or items.Certain words were capitalized and defined already in this agreement. For example, a partner is called the "Partner".  Use the same predefined terms in your additional clauses.Do not use pronouns such as: they, us, we, our, you, or me. Pronouns may be ambiguous and can cause confusion. e.g.:Wrong: If a Partner's ownership interest becomes available for sale, we have a right to first purchase:Right: If a Partner's ownership interest becomes available for sale, the remaining Partners have a right to first purchase.How do I draft the clause in plain English?Plain English means language that is simple and conveys ideas with the greatest possible clarity and avoids using legalese.Legalistic StylePlain Englishat the present time nowdue to the fact that because; sinceduring such time aswhilefor the duration ofduringinasmuch asbecause; sincein the event thatif notwithstanding the fact that although; even ifprior to before   pursuant to under; in accordance with subsequent toafter that certainawith reference toaboutMiscellaneous tipsDo not abbreviate words.Use numerals, not words, to denote amounts.Try not to repeat or contradict what has already been stated in the Partnership Agreement.Only put one paragraph per additional clause.Order your additional clauses in a logical sequence.Make sure your meaning is clear.Spell-check your clause.

									Unsure
								
									Specify Date
								












					Common Questions
Do I need witnesses?It is a good idea to have your signatures witnessed even though most documents and contracts do not require a witness for them to be legally valid. Many banks and other institutions have their own internal policies about signing requirements, and may refuse to accept documents that are not witnessed regardless of the fact that the documents are legally valid. If you want to avoid bureaucratic hold-ups, it may be a good idea to have your document witnessed.Who can be a witness?Generally, the person you choose to witness a document should have no financial or other interest in the agreement. A neutral third party is the best choice. A neutral third party is someone not related to either party and who does not benefit from the contract. Ideally a witness will observe the parties signing the document and then the witness will sign the document as proof that they witnessed the parties signing. The witness is not usually required to know or understand the contents of the document.How do I file my Partnership Agreement?You do not file your general partnership agreement. The general partnership agreement is simply an agreement between the partners. Only where there is limited liability for the owners, such as LLP, LLC, and corporations, are companies required to register. The partners in a general partnership have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership.

					Common Questions
What is a Partnership?A partnership  is a form of business organization in which two or more individuals (partners) manage and operate the business with a view to making a profit. Each partner shares a fixed proportion of the partnership profits and losses.What is the difference between a General Partnership and other types of partnerships?A General Partnership is a business model consisting of two or more persons (general partners) where each partner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the partnership (joint and several liability). Each partner is responsible for the outcome of any legal action (lawsuit) regardless of whether the partner was personally involved in the actions that led to the lawsuit. LegalContracts.com's Partnership Agreement is designed for use with a General Partnership.A Limited Partnership consists of at least one General Partner as well as one or more Limited Partners. Similar to a General Partnership, the General Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. The liability of a Limited Partner is limited to the amount of capital they contributed to the partnership.In a Limited-Liability Partnership , each partner is only liable for their own actions (and the acts of employees under their direct supervision) and not for the negligent acts of other partners. Limited-Liability Partnerships are commonly used by accounting firms and law firms.What is a Partnership Agreement?A partnership agreement is an agreement between two or more persons (partners) setting out the terms and conditions under which they will operate a for-profit business partnership. The partnership agreement will describe the cash contribution requirements for each partner, the distribution of profits and losses between partners, as well as other duties and obligations. The general partnership agreement does not have to be filed or registered.What partnership name should I use?The name of the Partnership should be distinguishable from the name of any other existing business entity (corporation, partnership, LLC, etc.). If you pick a name that is too similar to an existing business you may be asked to change it. A corporate name search is recommended.

					Common Questions
What is the fiscal year?The fiscal year is a 12-month accounting period of business operations beginning at any date. A company can schedule their fiscal year-end to coincide with a less busy time of the business year. A retail company that is very busy during the holiday season may elect to have a non-calendar fiscal year-end during a less busy period. That way they will have time to count inventories and prepare financial statements with minimal interference from the busy holiday season.What is the difference between Cash method and Accrual method of accounting?Cash: A method of recording earnings and expenses only upon receipt or payment without regard to when they occurred or were incurred.Accrual: A method of recording earnings and expenses as they occur or are incurred, without regard to the actual date of collection or payment.What is Goodwill?Goodwill is the value of a business beyond the market value of its assets. It is a reflection of the Company's competitive advantage through reputation,  location, brand name, and good customer service. Goodwill may include other intangible assets such as patents or proprietary technology. Goodwill is usually determined by generally accepted accounting methods.What is a Tax Matters Partner?The Tax Matters Partner is the Partner selected by the Partnership  to represent the company to the Internal Revenue Service and to make decisions on behalf of the Partnership concerning taxation issues. The Internal Revenue Code requires that the company designate a Partner for this purpose.The Tax Matters Partner prepares and submits all tax returns and reports as required by the taxation legislation.Why does the annual report always include the federal income tax report?The annual report will always include the federal income tax report because each Partner will need that information to file their personal income tax. The Partnership itself does not usually pay income tax. Partnership income passes un-taxed to the Partners in the form of a distribution or dividend which is then taxed as personal income.

					Common Questions
How can the Partnership be managed?The day-to-day management of the company can be performed by an individual Managing Partner or through the equitable participation of all Partners through majority votes where necessary. Note that where there is a Managing Partner, many substantial issues will still be resolved by a vote of all Partners.What is a managing partner?A partnership may have a managing partner who is responsible for managing the business. The managing partner will make all the day-to-day decisions of the partnership. All partners in a general partnership will have the right to participate in the management and control of the partnership unless the management obligations are delegated to one or more managing partners in the partnership agreement.What is meant by binding the Partnership in contract?In general, each Partner is deemed to be an agent of the company and each Partner is therefore able to commit the company to business contracts that are within the normal business activities of the company.In general, it is good practice to specify who has authority to bind the company in contract and then to ensure that all customers and suppliers have knowledge of who has authority and who does not.




					Voting

Percent vote required to amend any part of this Agreement:

 (eg. 51, 100, etc.)





					Common Questions
Why require minimum voting levels?The rights of all Partners, including minority Partners, need to be respected. Some business decisions can substantially change the nature of the business, possibly greatly increasing the risk to individual Partners. In general, all Partners should have a voice in any decisions that could substantially affect their business interests.What are the voting methods?On issues where Partners are required to vote, voting may be proportional to each Partner's relative Capital Contribution or proportional to each Partner's relative profit entitlement or there may be an equal vote where each Partner gets one vote.Even though the Partnership will be managed day-to-day by a Managing Partner there will still be substantial issues that require a vote of the Partners. 




					Actions Requiring Unanimous Consent
				
Select the issues that require the unanimous consent of all Partners:


Incurring Partnership liabilities over a fixed amount.
All Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the Partnership. Where expansion of the Partnership requires a significant financial investment involving a large debt load, the interests of all Partners must be considered before proceeding with that additional risk.


Single liability expense limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Incurring single transaction expenses over a fixed amount.
All Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the Partnership. To protect the interests of all Partners, the unanimous consent of all Partners may be required when making substantial purchases.


Single transaction expense limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Sale of any Partnership asset with fair market value over a fixed amount.
Sale of significant Partnership assets should require the unanimous consent of all Partners so that the interests of all Partners are protected. An individual Partner should not be permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership property. An individual Partner should also not be allowed to use Partnership property as collateral for a loan (either a personal loan or a Partnership loan).


Fair market value limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Hiring an employee with annual salary over a fixed amount.

Annual salary limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Firing of any employee.



Releasing any Partnership claim except for payment in full.
Where the Partnership has a claim against another person or business entity or where a debt is owed to the Partnership, it is in the best interest of the Partnership and the individual Partners if these obligations owed to the Partnership are paid in full. If an obligation is to be released for less than full consideration it is important that the interests of all Partners are considered.




Assignment of ownership rights of Partnership property.
Individual Partners do not have property rights in Partnership property. In order to protect the interests of all Partners from unauthorized behavior involving Partnership property, the Partners may want to have more control over the use, lending and sale of Partnership property.




Endangering the ownership or possession of Partnership property.
Individual Partners do not have property rights in Partnership property. The interests of all Partners must be considered where Partnership assets are put at risk either by loaning to a third party or placing the asset in an environment where the asset is subjected to theft or loss.




Assignment of check signing authority.




					Common Questions
Why require unanimous consent?In general, business decisions will be resolved by a majority vote of the Partners. However where the impact on individual Partners will be significant, the Partnership may wish to resolve these decisions through a unanimous vote in order to protect the interests of all Partners.What is meant by "Incurring liabilities or expenditures over a fixed amount"?Where normal operations or an extraordinary expansion of the Partnership requires a significant financial investment involving additional expenses or a large debt load, the interests of all Partners must be respected and the unanimous consent of all Partners may be required before proceeding with that risk. Undertaking modest expenses may be resolved with a simple majority vote however, incurring expenses over a certain amount should require a unanimous vote. You will be asked to enter an amount. Any expenditures over that amount will require the unanimous consent of all Partners.

					Common Questions
Why have a period of prohibition on withdrawal?Partners in a Partnership have a duty to act in the best interest of the Partnership and each other. By enforcing a prohibition on withdrawal, individuals will be motivated to take their responsibility as a Partner seriously and commit to at least a minimum period with the Partnership. The other Partners can then feel comfortable relying on the commitment of their fellow Partners to the purpose and goals of the Partnership.Where a Partner withdraws prior to the end of the initial period of prohibition, that Partner may be subject to penalties that reasonably reflect the damages done to the Partnership by that early withdrawal including, but not limited to, lost Partnership earnings.How does a partnership end?The Partnership can end by agreement of the Partners or the Partners can expressly agree that the Partnership will end at a specified date, or upon completion of certain tasks. In some jurisdictions the Partnership may end on the death or bankruptcy of a Partner unless the Partnership Agreement expressly states otherwise.How does a partner leave?Where there is no Partnership Agreement, the Partners can make a written submission to the other Partners to withdraw from the Partnership. A Partnership Agreement should protect the Partnership and the remaining Partners from the unexpected withdrawal of an essential Partner. If the voluntary withdrawal of a Partner offends a term of the Partnership Agreement, then the withdrawing Partner may be liable for any damages suffered by the Partnership or the remaining Partners.Can a partner transfer their interest?Yes, a Partner can transfer their interest in the Partnership, if the Partnership agreement does not restrict a transfer. If an individual Partner becomes bankrupt then a third party may have a claim against that Partner's interest in the Partnership. However, depending on the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the recipient of a transferred interest may not be given any power to vote or to participate in decision-making. The rights and obligations of a recipient of a Partnership interest may be limited to the profits and losses of the Partnership. This is to ensure that the remaining Partners are not affected by the extravagance or incompatible notions of an unexpected new Partner.How can assets be distributed on dissolution?When a Partnership is dissolved, the proceeds from the sale of the assets may be distributed among the Partners either in proportion to their respective capital contributions or in proportion to the designated profit/loss sharing ratios.Note: The distribution method on dissolution may be different from the method used for ongoing profit and loss distribution. For example, to get the Partnership started, one Partner may provide technical expertise while another Partner provides cash. They may share ongoing profits on a 50/50 basis but in the event of the dissolution  of the company the cash investor may expect to get back 100% of his cash investment.




					Duty of Loyalty
				
Can Partners participate in activities that compete with the Partnership?


Yes

No






After leaving, a Partner cannot compete against the Partnership for:


								Three Months
							
								Six Months
							
								One Year
							
								Two Years
							
								Three Years
							
								Four Years
							
								Five Years
							
								Ten Years
							





					Common Questions
What is the Duty of Loyalty?Partners owe each other, and the Partnership, a fiduciary duty. Unless permitted in the Partnership Agreement, a Partner cannot compete with the Partnership by participating in a similar business in the same geographical area, and cannot take opportunities for themself that the Partnership may want to pursue, nor act either willfully or recklessly in a manner that will harm the Partnership. After leaving, why can't a partner compete?Where the Partner or manager leaves for any reason and the Partnership survives the dissociation, it will be in the best interest of the Partnership to prevent dissociated Partners or managers from participating in competing ventures. It is presumed that a Partner or manager has had access to confidential information while working at the Partnership. It would be unfair to use that information to participate in a competing venture.

					Common Questions
How should I refer to people and terms in the clause?Do not use several names or words to refer to the same person or thing as it could cause confusion and ambiguity by appearing to introduce new or different people or items.Certain words were capitalized and defined already in this agreement. For example, a partner is called the "Partner".  Use the same predefined terms in your additional clauses.Do not use pronouns such as: they, us, we, our, you, or me. Pronouns may be ambiguous and can cause confusion. e.g.:Wrong: If a Partner's ownership interest becomes available for sale, we have a right to first purchase:Right: If a Partner's ownership interest becomes available for sale, the remaining Partners have a right to first purchase.How do I draft the clause in plain English?Plain English means language that is simple and conveys ideas with the greatest possible clarity and avoids using legalese.Legalistic StylePlain Englishat the present time nowdue to the fact that because; sinceduring such time aswhilefor the duration ofduringinasmuch asbecause; sincein the event thatif notwithstanding the fact that although; even ifprior to before   pursuant to under; in accordance with subsequent toafter that certainawith reference toaboutMiscellaneous tipsDo not abbreviate words.Use numerals, not words, to denote amounts.Try not to repeat or contradict what has already been stated in the Partnership Agreement.Only put one paragraph per additional clause.Order your additional clauses in a logical sequence.Make sure your meaning is clear.Spell-check your clause.

Are witnesses required?


Yes

No

									Unsure
								
									Specify Date
								












					Common Questions
Do I need witnesses?It is a good idea to have your signatures witnessed even though most documents and contracts do not require a witness for them to be legally valid. Many banks and other institutions have their own internal policies about signing requirements, and may refuse to accept documents that are not witnessed regardless of the fact that the documents are legally valid. If you want to avoid bureaucratic hold-ups, it may be a good idea to have your document witnessed.Who can be a witness?Generally, the person you choose to witness a document should have no financial or other interest in the agreement. A neutral third party is the best choice. A neutral third party is someone not related to either party and who does not benefit from the contract. Ideally a witness will observe the parties signing the document and then the witness will sign the document as proof that they witnessed the parties signing. The witness is not usually required to know or understand the contents of the document.How do I file my Partnership Agreement?You do not file your general partnership agreement. The general partnership agreement is simply an agreement between the partners. Only where there is limited liability for the owners, such as LLP, LLC, and corporations, are companies required to register. The partners in a general partnership have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership.

					Common Questions
What is a Partnership?A partnership  is a form of business organization in which two or more individuals (partners) manage and operate the business with a view to making a profit. Each partner shares a fixed proportion of the partnership profits and losses.What is the difference between a General Partnership and other types of partnerships?A General Partnership is a business model consisting of two or more persons (general partners) where each partner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the partnership (joint and several liability). Each partner is responsible for the outcome of any legal action (lawsuit) regardless of whether the partner was personally involved in the actions that led to the lawsuit. LegalContracts.com's Partnership Agreement is designed for use with a General Partnership.A Limited Partnership consists of at least one General Partner as well as one or more Limited Partners. Similar to a General Partnership, the General Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. The liability of a Limited Partner is limited to the amount of capital they contributed to the partnership.In a Limited-Liability Partnership , each partner is only liable for their own actions (and the acts of employees under their direct supervision) and not for the negligent acts of other partners. Limited-Liability Partnerships are commonly used by accounting firms and law firms.What is a Partnership Agreement?A partnership agreement is an agreement between two or more persons (partners) setting out the terms and conditions under which they will operate a for-profit business partnership. The partnership agreement will describe the cash contribution requirements for each partner, the distribution of profits and losses between partners, as well as other duties and obligations. The general partnership agreement does not have to be filed or registered.What partnership name should I use?The name of the Partnership should be distinguishable from the name of any other existing business entity (corporation, partnership, LLC, etc.). If you pick a name that is too similar to an existing business you may be asked to change it. A corporate name search is recommended.

					Common Questions
What is the fiscal year?The fiscal year is a 12-month accounting period of business operations beginning at any date. A company can schedule their fiscal year-end to coincide with a less busy time of the business year. A retail company that is very busy during the holiday season may elect to have a non-calendar fiscal year-end during a less busy period. That way they will have time to count inventories and prepare financial statements with minimal interference from the busy holiday season.What is the difference between Cash method and Accrual method of accounting?Cash: A method of recording earnings and expenses only upon receipt or payment without regard to when they occurred or were incurred.Accrual: A method of recording earnings and expenses as they occur or are incurred, without regard to the actual date of collection or payment.What is Goodwill?Goodwill is the value of a business beyond the market value of its assets. It is a reflection of the Company's competitive advantage through reputation,  location, brand name, and good customer service. Goodwill may include other intangible assets such as patents or proprietary technology. Goodwill is usually determined by generally accepted accounting methods.What is a Tax Matters Partner?The Tax Matters Partner is the Partner selected by the Partnership  to represent the company to the Internal Revenue Service and to make decisions on behalf of the Partnership concerning taxation issues. The Internal Revenue Code requires that the company designate a Partner for this purpose.The Tax Matters Partner prepares and submits all tax returns and reports as required by the taxation legislation.Why does the annual report always include the federal income tax report?The annual report will always include the federal income tax report because each Partner will need that information to file their personal income tax. The Partnership itself does not usually pay income tax. Partnership income passes un-taxed to the Partners in the form of a distribution or dividend which is then taxed as personal income.

					Common Questions
How can the Partnership be managed?The day-to-day management of the company can be performed by an individual Managing Partner or through the equitable participation of all Partners through majority votes where necessary. Note that where there is a Managing Partner, many substantial issues will still be resolved by a vote of all Partners.What is a managing partner?A partnership may have a managing partner who is responsible for managing the business. The managing partner will make all the day-to-day decisions of the partnership. All partners in a general partnership will have the right to participate in the management and control of the partnership unless the management obligations are delegated to one or more managing partners in the partnership agreement.What is meant by binding the Partnership in contract?In general, each Partner is deemed to be an agent of the company and each Partner is therefore able to commit the company to business contracts that are within the normal business activities of the company.In general, it is good practice to specify who has authority to bind the company in contract and then to ensure that all customers and suppliers have knowledge of who has authority and who does not.




					Voting

Proportional to Profit Share

Equal Vote

 (eg. 51, 100, etc.)



Percent vote required to amend any part of this Agreement:

 (eg. 51, 100, etc.)





					Common Questions
Why require minimum voting levels?The rights of all Partners, including minority Partners, need to be respected. Some business decisions can substantially change the nature of the business, possibly greatly increasing the risk to individual Partners. In general, all Partners should have a voice in any decisions that could substantially affect their business interests.What are the voting methods?On issues where Partners are required to vote, voting may be proportional to each Partner's relative Capital Contribution or proportional to each Partner's relative profit entitlement or there may be an equal vote where each Partner gets one vote.Even though the Partnership will be managed day-to-day by a Managing Partner there will still be substantial issues that require a vote of the Partners. 




					Actions Requiring Unanimous Consent
				
Select the issues that require the unanimous consent of all Partners:


Incurring Partnership liabilities over a fixed amount.
All Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the Partnership. Where expansion of the Partnership requires a significant financial investment involving a large debt load, the interests of all Partners must be considered before proceeding with that additional risk.


Single liability expense limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Incurring single transaction expenses over a fixed amount.
All Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the Partnership. To protect the interests of all Partners, the unanimous consent of all Partners may be required when making substantial purchases.


Single transaction expense limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Sale of any Partnership asset with fair market value over a fixed amount.
Sale of significant Partnership assets should require the unanimous consent of all Partners so that the interests of all Partners are protected. An individual Partner should not be permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership property. An individual Partner should also not be allowed to use Partnership property as collateral for a loan (either a personal loan or a Partnership loan).


Fair market value limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Hiring an employee with annual salary over a fixed amount.

Annual salary limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Firing of any employee.



Releasing any Partnership claim except for payment in full.
Where the Partnership has a claim against another person or business entity or where a debt is owed to the Partnership, it is in the best interest of the Partnership and the individual Partners if these obligations owed to the Partnership are paid in full. If an obligation is to be released for less than full consideration it is important that the interests of all Partners are considered.




Assignment of ownership rights of Partnership property.
Individual Partners do not have property rights in Partnership property. In order to protect the interests of all Partners from unauthorized behavior involving Partnership property, the Partners may want to have more control over the use, lending and sale of Partnership property.




Endangering the ownership or possession of Partnership property.
Individual Partners do not have property rights in Partnership property. The interests of all Partners must be considered where Partnership assets are put at risk either by loaning to a third party or placing the asset in an environment where the asset is subjected to theft or loss.




Assignment of check signing authority.




					Common Questions
Why require unanimous consent?In general, business decisions will be resolved by a majority vote of the Partners. However where the impact on individual Partners will be significant, the Partnership may wish to resolve these decisions through a unanimous vote in order to protect the interests of all Partners.What is meant by "Incurring liabilities or expenditures over a fixed amount"?Where normal operations or an extraordinary expansion of the Partnership requires a significant financial investment involving additional expenses or a large debt load, the interests of all Partners must be respected and the unanimous consent of all Partners may be required before proceeding with that risk. Undertaking modest expenses may be resolved with a simple majority vote however, incurring expenses over a certain amount should require a unanimous vote. You will be asked to enter an amount. Any expenditures over that amount will require the unanimous consent of all Partners.

					Common Questions
Why have a period of prohibition on withdrawal?Partners in a Partnership have a duty to act in the best interest of the Partnership and each other. By enforcing a prohibition on withdrawal, individuals will be motivated to take their responsibility as a Partner seriously and commit to at least a minimum period with the Partnership. The other Partners can then feel comfortable relying on the commitment of their fellow Partners to the purpose and goals of the Partnership.Where a Partner withdraws prior to the end of the initial period of prohibition, that Partner may be subject to penalties that reasonably reflect the damages done to the Partnership by that early withdrawal including, but not limited to, lost Partnership earnings.How does a partnership end?The Partnership can end by agreement of the Partners or the Partners can expressly agree that the Partnership will end at a specified date, or upon completion of certain tasks. In some jurisdictions the Partnership may end on the death or bankruptcy of a Partner unless the Partnership Agreement expressly states otherwise.How does a partner leave?Where there is no Partnership Agreement, the Partners can make a written submission to the other Partners to withdraw from the Partnership. A Partnership Agreement should protect the Partnership and the remaining Partners from the unexpected withdrawal of an essential Partner. If the voluntary withdrawal of a Partner offends a term of the Partnership Agreement, then the withdrawing Partner may be liable for any damages suffered by the Partnership or the remaining Partners.Can a partner transfer their interest?Yes, a Partner can transfer their interest in the Partnership, if the Partnership agreement does not restrict a transfer. If an individual Partner becomes bankrupt then a third party may have a claim against that Partner's interest in the Partnership. However, depending on the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the recipient of a transferred interest may not be given any power to vote or to participate in decision-making. The rights and obligations of a recipient of a Partnership interest may be limited to the profits and losses of the Partnership. This is to ensure that the remaining Partners are not affected by the extravagance or incompatible notions of an unexpected new Partner.How can assets be distributed on dissolution?When a Partnership is dissolved, the proceeds from the sale of the assets may be distributed among the Partners either in proportion to their respective capital contributions or in proportion to the designated profit/loss sharing ratios.Note: The distribution method on dissolution may be different from the method used for ongoing profit and loss distribution. For example, to get the Partnership started, one Partner may provide technical expertise while another Partner provides cash. They may share ongoing profits on a 50/50 basis but in the event of the dissolution  of the company the cash investor may expect to get back 100% of his cash investment.




					Duty of Loyalty
				
Can Partners participate in activities that compete with the Partnership?


Yes

No






After leaving, a Partner cannot compete against the Partnership for:


								Three Months
							
								Six Months
							
								One Year
							
								Two Years
							
								Three Years
							
								Four Years
							
								Five Years
							
								Ten Years
							





					Common Questions
What is the Duty of Loyalty?Partners owe each other, and the Partnership, a fiduciary duty. Unless permitted in the Partnership Agreement, a Partner cannot compete with the Partnership by participating in a similar business in the same geographical area, and cannot take opportunities for themself that the Partnership may want to pursue, nor act either willfully or recklessly in a manner that will harm the Partnership. After leaving, why can't a partner compete?Where the Partner or manager leaves for any reason and the Partnership survives the dissociation, it will be in the best interest of the Partnership to prevent dissociated Partners or managers from participating in competing ventures. It is presumed that a Partner or manager has had access to confidential information while working at the Partnership. It would be unfair to use that information to participate in a competing venture.

					Common Questions
How should I refer to people and terms in the clause?Do not use several names or words to refer to the same person or thing as it could cause confusion and ambiguity by appearing to introduce new or different people or items.Certain words were capitalized and defined already in this agreement. For example, a partner is called the "Partner".  Use the same predefined terms in your additional clauses.Do not use pronouns such as: they, us, we, our, you, or me. Pronouns may be ambiguous and can cause confusion. e.g.:Wrong: If a Partner's ownership interest becomes available for sale, we have a right to first purchase:Right: If a Partner's ownership interest becomes available for sale, the remaining Partners have a right to first purchase.How do I draft the clause in plain English?Plain English means language that is simple and conveys ideas with the greatest possible clarity and avoids using legalese.Legalistic StylePlain Englishat the present time nowdue to the fact that because; sinceduring such time aswhilefor the duration ofduringinasmuch asbecause; sincein the event thatif notwithstanding the fact that although; even ifprior to before   pursuant to under; in accordance with subsequent toafter that certainawith reference toaboutMiscellaneous tipsDo not abbreviate words.Use numerals, not words, to denote amounts.Try not to repeat or contradict what has already been stated in the Partnership Agreement.Only put one paragraph per additional clause.Order your additional clauses in a logical sequence.Make sure your meaning is clear.Spell-check your clause.






					Signing Details
				
Are witnesses required?


Yes

No

									Today
								
									This Month
								
									Unsure
								
									Specify Date
								












					Common Questions
Do I need witnesses?It is a good idea to have your signatures witnessed even though most documents and contracts do not require a witness for them to be legally valid. Many banks and other institutions have their own internal policies about signing requirements, and may refuse to accept documents that are not witnessed regardless of the fact that the documents are legally valid. If you want to avoid bureaucratic hold-ups, it may be a good idea to have your document witnessed.Who can be a witness?Generally, the person you choose to witness a document should have no financial or other interest in the agreement. A neutral third party is the best choice. A neutral third party is someone not related to either party and who does not benefit from the contract. Ideally a witness will observe the parties signing the document and then the witness will sign the document as proof that they witnessed the parties signing. The witness is not usually required to know or understand the contents of the document.How do I file my Partnership Agreement?You do not file your general partnership agreement. The general partnership agreement is simply an agreement between the partners. Only where there is limited liability for the owners, such as LLP, LLC, and corporations, are companies required to register. The partners in a general partnership have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership.

					Common Questions
What is a Partnership?A partnership  is a form of business organization in which two or more individuals (partners) manage and operate the business with a view to making a profit. Each partner shares a fixed proportion of the partnership profits and losses.What is the difference between a General Partnership and other types of partnerships?A General Partnership is a business model consisting of two or more persons (general partners) where each partner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the partnership (joint and several liability). Each partner is responsible for the outcome of any legal action (lawsuit) regardless of whether the partner was personally involved in the actions that led to the lawsuit. LegalContracts.com's Partnership Agreement is designed for use with a General Partnership.A Limited Partnership consists of at least one General Partner as well as one or more Limited Partners. Similar to a General Partnership, the General Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. The liability of a Limited Partner is limited to the amount of capital they contributed to the partnership.In a Limited-Liability Partnership , each partner is only liable for their own actions (and the acts of employees under their direct supervision) and not for the negligent acts of other partners. Limited-Liability Partnerships are commonly used by accounting firms and law firms.What is a Partnership Agreement?A partnership agreement is an agreement between two or more persons (partners) setting out the terms and conditions under which they will operate a for-profit business partnership. The partnership agreement will describe the cash contribution requirements for each partner, the distribution of profits and losses between partners, as well as other duties and obligations. The general partnership agreement does not have to be filed or registered.What partnership name should I use?The name of the Partnership should be distinguishable from the name of any other existing business entity (corporation, partnership, LLC, etc.). If you pick a name that is too similar to an existing business you may be asked to change it. A corporate name search is recommended.

					Common Questions
What is the fiscal year?The fiscal year is a 12-month accounting period of business operations beginning at any date. A company can schedule their fiscal year-end to coincide with a less busy time of the business year. A retail company that is very busy during the holiday season may elect to have a non-calendar fiscal year-end during a less busy period. That way they will have time to count inventories and prepare financial statements with minimal interference from the busy holiday season.What is the difference between Cash method and Accrual method of accounting?Cash: A method of recording earnings and expenses only upon receipt or payment without regard to when they occurred or were incurred.Accrual: A method of recording earnings and expenses as they occur or are incurred, without regard to the actual date of collection or payment.What is Goodwill?Goodwill is the value of a business beyond the market value of its assets. It is a reflection of the Company's competitive advantage through reputation,  location, brand name, and good customer service. Goodwill may include other intangible assets such as patents or proprietary technology. Goodwill is usually determined by generally accepted accounting methods.What is a Tax Matters Partner?The Tax Matters Partner is the Partner selected by the Partnership  to represent the company to the Internal Revenue Service and to make decisions on behalf of the Partnership concerning taxation issues. The Internal Revenue Code requires that the company designate a Partner for this purpose.The Tax Matters Partner prepares and submits all tax returns and reports as required by the taxation legislation.Why does the annual report always include the federal income tax report?The annual report will always include the federal income tax report because each Partner will need that information to file their personal income tax. The Partnership itself does not usually pay income tax. Partnership income passes un-taxed to the Partners in the form of a distribution or dividend which is then taxed as personal income.

					Common Questions
How can the Partnership be managed?The day-to-day management of the company can be performed by an individual Managing Partner or through the equitable participation of all Partners through majority votes where necessary. Note that where there is a Managing Partner, many substantial issues will still be resolved by a vote of all Partners.What is a managing partner?A partnership may have a managing partner who is responsible for managing the business. The managing partner will make all the day-to-day decisions of the partnership. All partners in a general partnership will have the right to participate in the management and control of the partnership unless the management obligations are delegated to one or more managing partners in the partnership agreement.What is meant by binding the Partnership in contract?In general, each Partner is deemed to be an agent of the company and each Partner is therefore able to commit the company to business contracts that are within the normal business activities of the company.In general, it is good practice to specify who has authority to bind the company in contract and then to ensure that all customers and suppliers have knowledge of who has authority and who does not.




					Voting

Proportional to Profit Share

Equal Vote

 (eg. 51, 100, etc.)



Percent vote required to amend any part of this Agreement:

 (eg. 51, 100, etc.)





					Common Questions
Why require minimum voting levels?The rights of all Partners, including minority Partners, need to be respected. Some business decisions can substantially change the nature of the business, possibly greatly increasing the risk to individual Partners. In general, all Partners should have a voice in any decisions that could substantially affect their business interests.What are the voting methods?On issues where Partners are required to vote, voting may be proportional to each Partner's relative Capital Contribution or proportional to each Partner's relative profit entitlement or there may be an equal vote where each Partner gets one vote.Even though the Partnership will be managed day-to-day by a Managing Partner there will still be substantial issues that require a vote of the Partners. 




					Actions Requiring Unanimous Consent
				
Select the issues that require the unanimous consent of all Partners:


Incurring Partnership liabilities over a fixed amount.
All Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the Partnership. Where expansion of the Partnership requires a significant financial investment involving a large debt load, the interests of all Partners must be considered before proceeding with that additional risk.


Single liability expense limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Incurring single transaction expenses over a fixed amount.
All Partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the Partnership. To protect the interests of all Partners, the unanimous consent of all Partners may be required when making substantial purchases.


Single transaction expense limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Sale of any Partnership asset with fair market value over a fixed amount.
Sale of significant Partnership assets should require the unanimous consent of all Partners so that the interests of all Partners are protected. An individual Partner should not be permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership property. An individual Partner should also not be allowed to use Partnership property as collateral for a loan (either a personal loan or a Partnership loan).


Fair market value limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Hiring an employee with annual salary over a fixed amount.

Annual salary limit:

$ (e.g. 25000, 100000)







Firing of any employee.



Releasing any Partnership claim except for payment in full.
Where the Partnership has a claim against another person or business entity or where a debt is owed to the Partnership, it is in the best interest of the Partnership and the individual Partners if these obligations owed to the Partnership are paid in full. If an obligation is to be released for less than full consideration it is important that the interests of all Partners are considered.




Assignment of ownership rights of Partnership property.
Individual Partners do not have property rights in Partnership property. In order to protect the interests of all Partners from unauthorized behavior involving Partnership property, the Partners may want to have more control over the use, lending and sale of Partnership property.




Endangering the ownership or possession of Partnership property.
Individual Partners do not have property rights in Partnership property. The interests of all Partners must be considered where Partnership assets are put at risk either by loaning to a third party or placing the asset in an environment where the asset is subjected to theft or loss.




Assignment of check signing authority.




					Common Questions
Why require unanimous consent?In general, business decisions will be resolved by a majority vote of the Partners. However where the impact on individual Partners will be significant, the Partnership may wish to resolve these decisions through a unanimous vote in order to protect the interests of all Partners.What is meant by "Incurring liabilities or expenditures over a fixed amount"?Where normal operations or an extraordinary expansion of the Partnership requires a significant financial investment involving additional expenses or a large debt load, the interests of all Partners must be respected and the unanimous consent of all Partners may be required before proceeding with that risk. Undertaking modest expenses may be resolved with a simple majority vote however, incurring expenses over a certain amount should require a unanimous vote. You will be asked to enter an amount. Any expenditures over that amount will require the unanimous consent of all Partners.

					Common Questions
Why have a period of prohibition on withdrawal?Partners in a Partnership have a duty to act in the best interest of the Partnership and each other. By enforcing a prohibition on withdrawal, individuals will be motivated to take their responsibility as a Partner seriously and commit to at least a minimum period with the Partnership. The other Partners can then feel comfortable relying on the commitment of their fellow Partners to the purpose and goals of the Partnership.Where a Partner withdraws prior to the end of the initial period of prohibition, that Partner may be subject to penalties that reasonably reflect the damages done to the Partnership by that early withdrawal including, but not limited to, lost Partnership earnings.How does a partnership end?The Partnership can end by agreement of the Partners or the Partners can expressly agree that the Partnership will end at a specified date, or upon completion of certain tasks. In some jurisdictions the Partnership may end on the death or bankruptcy of a Partner unless the Partnership Agreement expressly states otherwise.How does a partner leave?Where there is no Partnership Agreement, the Partners can make a written submission to the other Partners to withdraw from the Partnership. A Partnership Agreement should protect the Partnership and the remaining Partners from the unexpected withdrawal of an essential Partner. If the voluntary withdrawal of a Partner offends a term of the Partnership Agreement, then the withdrawing Partner may be liable for any damages suffered by the Partnership or the remaining Partners.Can a partner transfer their interest?Yes, a Partner can transfer their interest in the Partnership, if the Partnership agreement does not restrict a transfer. If an individual Partner becomes bankrupt then a third party may have a claim against that Partner's interest in the Partnership. However, depending on the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the recipient of a transferred interest may not be given any power to vote or to participate in decision-making. The rights and obligations of a recipient of a Partnership interest may be limited to the profits and losses of the Partnership. This is to ensure that the remaining Partners are not affected by the extravagance or incompatible notions of an unexpected new Partner.How can assets be distributed on dissolution?When a Partnership is dissolved, the proceeds from the sale of the assets may be distributed among the Partners either in proportion to their respective capital contributions or in proportion to the designated profit/loss sharing ratios.Note: The distribution method on dissolution may be different from the method used for ongoing profit and loss distribution. For example, to get the Partnership started, one Partner may provide technical expertise while another Partner provides cash. They may share ongoing profits on a 50/50 basis but in the event of the dissolution  of the company the cash investor may expect to get back 100% of his cash investment.




					Duty of Loyalty

								Six Months
							
								One Year
							
								Two Years
							
								Three Years
							
								Four Years
							
								Five Years
							
								Ten Years
							





					Common Questions
What is the Duty of Loyalty?Partners owe each other, and the Partnership, a fiduciary duty. Unless permitted in the Partnership Agreement, a Partner cannot compete with the Partnership by participating in a similar business in the same geographical area, and cannot take opportunities for themself that the Partnership may want to pursue, nor act either willfully or recklessly in a manner that will harm the Partnership. After leaving, why can't a partner compete?Where the Partner or manager leaves for any reason and the Partnership survives the dissociation, it will be in the best interest of the Partnership to prevent dissociated Partners or managers from participating in competing ventures. It is presumed that a Partner or manager has had access to confidential information while working at the Partnership. It would be unfair to use that information to participate in a competing venture.

					Common Questions
How should I refer to people and terms in the clause?Do not use several names or words to refer to the same person or thing as it could cause confusion and ambiguity by appearing to introduce new or different people or items.Certain words were capitalized and defined already in this agreement. For example, a partner is called the "Partner".  Use the same predefined terms in your additional clauses.Do not use pronouns such as: they, us, we, our, you, or me. Pronouns may be ambiguous and can cause confusion. e.g.:Wrong: If a Partner's ownership interest becomes available for sale, we have a right to first purchase:Right: If a Partner's ownership interest becomes available for sale, the remaining Partners have a right to first purchase.How do I draft the clause in plain English?Plain English means language that is simple and conveys ideas with the greatest possible clarity and avoids using legalese.Legalistic StylePlain Englishat the present time nowdue to the fact that because; sinceduring such time aswhilefor the duration ofduringinasmuch asbecause; sincein the event thatif notwithstanding the fact that although; even ifprior to before   pursuant to under; in accordance with subsequent toafter that certainawith reference toaboutMiscellaneous tipsDo not abbreviate words.Use numerals, not words, to denote amounts.Try not to repeat or contradict what has already been stated in the Partnership Agreement.Only put one paragraph per additional clause.Order your additional clauses in a logical sequence.Make sure your meaning is clear.Spell-check your clause.

					Common Questions
Do I need witnesses?It is a good idea to have your signatures witnessed even though most documents and contracts do not require a witness for them to be legally valid. Many banks and other institutions have their own internal policies about signing requirements, and may refuse to accept documents that are not witnessed regardless of the fact that the documents are legally valid. If you want to avoid bureaucratic hold-ups, it may be a good idea to have your document witnessed.Who can be a witness?Generally, the person you choose to witness a document should have no financial or other interest in the agreement. A neutral third party is the best choice. A neutral third party is someone not related to either party and who does not benefit from the contract. Ideally a witness will observe the parties signing the document and then the witness will sign the document as proof that they witnessed the parties signing. The witness is not usually required to know or understand the contents of the document.How do I file my Partnership Agreement?You do not file your general partnership agreement. The general partnership agreement is simply an agreement between the partners. Only where there is limited liability for the owners, such as LLP, LLC, and corporations, are companies required to register. The partners in a general partnership have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership.
