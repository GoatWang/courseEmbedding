Top Fee only Wealth Managers
2015
View Halbert Hargrove's Ranking
View RankingDisclaimer and Methodology


Disclaimer
The rating is not indicative of Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors future performance. Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors did not pay a fee to participate in the survey.
Methodology
The CNBC Digital editorial team, along with Meridian-IQ, created the following ranking methodology for its Top 100 Fee-Only Wealth Management Firms rankings. Scores for each measure listed below were weighted according to a proprietary formula to arrive at a final total rank:

Assets under management
Having staff with professional designations such as a CFP or CFA
Working with third-party professionals such as attorneys or CPAs
Average account size
Client segmentation
Growth of assets
Years in business
Number of advisory clients
Providing advice on insurance solutions

Firms with greater AUM totals were given a higher ranking in the case of numerical ties of the above formula. The Meridian/AdviceIQ team then applied the formula to the Meridian-IQ database of all RIAs to create the list. The final step to create the Top 100 Fee-Only Wealth Management Firms list for CNBC.com was to apply the AdviceIQ Regulatory Compliance Review (RCR) process to the master list and eliminate any firm that failed the RCR process. The RCR process is a due-diligence process whereby each advisory firm was compared with the RCR database of all regulatory actions from all four primary regulators: SEC, FINRA, state regulators and state insurance commissioners. In order to pass the RCR process, an advisory firm cannot have any complaints, actions or disclosures from any of the above regulators.

Top Wealth Managers
2015
Halbert Hargrove ranks #36 among top 100
View RankingDisclaimer and Methodology


Disclaimer
The rating is not indicative of Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors future performance. Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors did not pay a fee to participate in the survey.
Methodology
Data for the Top Wealth Managers list is compiled by our partners at RIA Database. Candidate firms qualify based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria. This year we expanded the list to 100 firms, and ranked them by assets under management for year-end 2014, reported as of March 31, 2015.
Members of the list must have manage at least 50% of their assets on behalf of retail clients, cannot run a broker-dealer (they can be affiliated with one), can not be a bank (trust companies are permitted), and must be performing wealth management services. Firms can not have had any regulatory, civil or criminal disclosures.
The list looks beyond exclusively fee-only advisors because the RIA industry is evolving to incorporate more hybrid models as more reps break way from broker-dealers but carry along old business that includes some commission-based work.




Wealth Management
Top 10 High-Net-Worth Advisors
2016
Halbert Hargrove ranks #8 among top 10
View RankingDisclaimer and Methodology


Disclaimer
The rating is not indicative of Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors future performance. Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors did not pay a fee to participate in the survey.
Methodology
WealthManagement’s Top 25 High-Net-Worth Advisors ranking was assembled using data from Meridian-IQ (in which Penton Media has a stake). Advisory firms are ranked by total assets under management. To land on the list, high-net-worth clients had to account for 76 percent or more of the firm’s business. Firms also had to have a focus on financial and retirement planning; institutional clients do not make up a substantial portion of their businesses. Finally, none of these firms are owned by a bank, broker/dealer or investment company.

RIA Leaders of 2016
2016
Halbert Hargrove ranks #12 among top 150
View RankingDisclaimer and Methodology


Disclaimer
The rating is not indicative of Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors future performance. Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors did not pay a fee to participate in the survey.
Methodology
Discovery Data compiled the rankings based on discretionary and nondiscretionary assets under management listed on SEC Form ADV. To capture independent fee-only planning firms, every effort is made to exclude firms with broker-dealer and insurance company affiliations and those with substantial outside ownership stakes held by private equity firms and some outside investors. The list also does not include roll-ups, aggregators or turnkey asset management programs. To capture firms that provide true holistic financial advice to individuals, only firms with 50% or more individual clients, as can be determined through the Form ADV, are included. Subjective review of unusual cases may result in inclusion or exclusion based on factors unique to those firms. As the RIA industry evolves, so does the criteria.

The Top 10 High-Net-Worth Advisors in 2016
2016
Halbert Hargrove ranks #8 among top 10
Disclaimer and Methodology



Disclaimer
The rating is not indicative of Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors future performance. Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors did not pay a fee to participate in the survey.
Methodology
WealthManagement’s Top 25 High-Net-Worth Advisors ranking was assembled using data from Meridian-IQ (in which Penton Media has a stake). Advisory firms are ranked by total assets under management. To land on the list, high-net-worth clients had to account for 76 percent or more of the firm’s business. Firms also had to have a focus on financial and retirement planning; institutional clients do not make up a substantial portion of their businesses. Finally, none of these firms are owned by a bank, broker/dealer or investment company.

Disclaimer and Methodology



Disclaimer
The rating is not indicative of Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors future performance. Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors did not pay a fee to participate in the survey.
Methodology
Discovery Data compiled the rankings based on discretionary and nondiscretionary assets under management listed on SEC Form ADV. To capture independent fee-only planning firms, every effort is made to exclude firms with broker-dealer and insurance company affiliations and those with substantial outside ownership stakes held by private equity firms and some outside investors. The list also does not include roll-ups, aggregators or turnkey asset management programs. To capture firms that provide true holistic financial advice to individuals, only firms with 50% or more individual clients, as can be determined through the Form ADV, are included. Subjective review of unusual cases may result in inclusion or exclusion based on factors unique to those firms. As the RIA industry evolves, so does the criteria.

Disclaimer
The rating is not indicative of Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors future performance. Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors did not pay a fee to participate in the survey.
Methodology
Data for the Top Wealth Managers list is compiled by our partners at RIA Database. Candidate firms qualify based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria. This year we expanded the list to 100 firms, and ranked them by assets under management for year-end 2014, reported as of March 31, 2015.
Members of the list must have manage at least 50% of their assets on behalf of retail clients, cannot run a broker-dealer (they can be affiliated with one), can not be a bank (trust companies are permitted), and must be performing wealth management services. Firms can not have had any regulatory, civil or criminal disclosures.
The list looks beyond exclusively fee-only advisors because the RIA industry is evolving to incorporate more hybrid models as more reps break way from broker-dealers but carry along old business that includes some commission-based work.

Disclaimer and Methodology



Disclaimer
The rating is not indicative of Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors future performance. Halbert Hargrove Global Advisors did not pay a fee to participate in the survey.
Methodology
The CNBC Digital editorial team, along with Meridian-IQ, created the following ranking methodology for its Top 100 Fee-Only Wealth Management Firms rankings. Scores for each measure listed below were weighted according to a proprietary formula to arrive at a final total rank:

Assets under management
Having staff with professional designations such as a CFP or CFA
Working with third-party professionals such as attorneys or CPAs
Average account size
Client segmentation
Growth of assets
Years in business
Number of advisory clients
Providing advice on insurance solutions

Firms with greater AUM totals were given a higher ranking in the case of numerical ties of the above formula. The Meridian/AdviceIQ team then applied the formula to the Meridian-IQ database of all RIAs to create the list. The final step to create the Top 100 Fee-Only Wealth Management Firms list for CNBC.com was to apply the AdviceIQ Regulatory Compliance Review (RCR) process to the master list and eliminate any firm that failed the RCR process. The RCR process is a due-diligence process whereby each advisory firm was compared with the RCR database of all regulatory actions from all four primary regulators: SEC, FINRA, state regulators and state insurance commissioners. In order to pass the RCR process, an advisory firm cannot have any complaints, actions or disclosures from any of the above regulators.
