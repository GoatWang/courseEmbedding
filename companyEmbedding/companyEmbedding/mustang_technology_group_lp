Adds New Precision Engagement and Unmanned Systems Capabilities and 
      Product Lines






December 19, 2013 03:35 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--L-3 Communications (NYSE:LLL) announced effective today, that it has 
      acquired Mustang Technology Group, L.P. The business, now 
      named L-3 Mustang Technology, develops and manufactures radar-based 
      sensors and systems used in precision-guided weapons, electronic 
      warfare, unmanned systems and other military applications. Headquartered 
      in Plano, Texas, L-3 Mustang employs approximately 115 people and its 
      products are used by the U.S. military, government agencies and prime 
      contractors. The business is expected to generate $36 million in sales 
      for the year ending December 31, 2013.
    


      “Mustang adds key capabilities, technical synergies, proprietary 
      technologies and new customers to L-3’s existing Precision Engagement 
      business in our Electronic Systems segment,” said Michael T. Strianese, 
      L-3’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This is a 
      terrific acquisition, which expands L-3’s DoD and classified business 
      base, and we look forward to integrating Mustang’s technologies into 
      L-3’s existing proprietary fuzing and ordnance and unmanned systems 
      products. The results for L-3 customers will be market-disrupting 
      products and product enhancements, which will improve mission 
      effectiveness of guided munitions, as well as a new portfolio of 
      solutions.”

      technology collection of software-defined radar and RF (radio frequency) 
      sensors and systems, with proprietary capabilities in radar-based 
      seeker, proximity fuze, hostile fire indicating and ISR (intelligence, 
      surveillance and reconnaissance) sensor applications. The company’s 
      products are on the leading edge of the current and next generation of 
      U.S. weapon systems requirements.
    

      Headquartered in New York City, L-3 employs approximately 51,000 people 
      worldwide and is a prime contractor in C3ISR (Command, 
      Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) 
      systems, platform and logistics solutions, and national security 
      solutions. L-3 is also a leading provider of a broad range of electronic 
      systems used on military and commercial platforms. The company reported 
      2012 sales of $13.1 billion.
