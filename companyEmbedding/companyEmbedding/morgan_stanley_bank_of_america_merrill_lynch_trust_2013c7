It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on twelve P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The transaction contains a group of exchangeable certificates. 
Classes A-S, B and C may be exchanged for Class PST certificates 
and Class PST may be exchanged for the Classes A-S, B and 
C. The PST certificates will be entitled to receive the sum of 
interest and principal distributable on the Classes A-S, 
B and C certificates that are exchanged for such PST certificates. 
The rating on the PST class was affirmed based on the weighted average 
rating factor (or WARF) of its exchangeable classes.




The ratings on the IO classes, classes X-A and X-B 
were affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average 
rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.2% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.4 % at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.0% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.3% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 21, 
compared to 22 at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the July 15, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 7.7% to $1.29 
billion from $1.39 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 61 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 13% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 57% of the pool. One loan, constituting 
1.7% of the pool, has an investment-grade structured 
credit assessment.




Six loans, constituting 20% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, the Oakridge Office Park Loan ($15.7 million 
-- 1.2% of the pool) is currently in special 
servicing. The loan is secured by five office properties totaling 
approximately 315,500 square feet (SF) in Orlando, Florida. 
The loan transferred to special servicing in June 2014 after several major 
tenants departed and/or downsized at their lease expirations. As 
of April 2016, the property was 48% leased, the same 
as last review and compared to 87% at securitization. The 
Special Servicer initially entered into a forbearance agreement with the 
Borrower to reduce payments to interest-only with an escalated 
maturity date of December 2014. The Borrower was unable to cure 
the default, foreclosure was filed and a receiver was appointed 
in February 2015. The special servicer indicated that the receiver 
is currently preparing the property for sale. Moody's estimates 
a moderate loss on this loan.




Moody's has assumed a high default probability for one poorly performing 
loan, constituting 2% of the pool, and has estimated 
an aggregate loss of $3.8 million (a 15% expected 
loss based on a 50% probability default) from this troubled loan.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 93% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 48% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 95%, 
compared to 99% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 9% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.2%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.73X and 1.09X, 
respectively, compared to 1.69X and 1.07X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the Sunvalley Shopping 
Center Fee Loan ($22.4 million -- 1.7% 
of the pool), which is secured by the leased fee interest associated 
with six parcels of land totaling 68.4 acres located in Concord, 
California. The parcels generate revenue through a ground lease 
to a 1.4 million square foot regional mall which is operated by 
an affiliate of Taubman Centers Inc. The mall anchors are Sears, 
JC Penney, and Macy's. Moody's structured credit assessment 
is aaa (sca.pd), the same as at Moody's last review.




The top three conduit loans represent 29% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Chrysler East Building Loan ($165 million 
-- 12.8% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 32-story, 745,000 SF multi-tenant office 
building within the Grand Central office market of New York, New 
York. The loan sponsor is Tishman Speyer Properties. Several 
leases expired in 2014 and 2015 including the two largest tenants at securitization, 
Credit Agricole (19% of the NRA) and Grant Thorton (8% of 
the NRA). Both tenants vacated the property, however, 
Credit Aricole was already subleasing its space and the majority of its 
original space has been re-leased. Property performance 
has declined since securitization and the property was 83% leased 
as of March 2016 compared to 96% at securitization. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 123% and 0.75X, respectively, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




The second largest loan is the Millennium Boston Retail Loan ($103.2 
million -- 8.0% of the pool), which is secured 
by nine commercial condominium units contained within three buildings, 
totaling 282,000 SF of mixed use space in the Midtown/Theater District 
area of downtown Boston, Massachusetts. The properties are 
100% leased to nine tenants, including Loews Theater, 
The Sports Club/LA, and CVS. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 84% and 1.03X, respectively, compared to 
85% and 1.02X at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Solomon Pond Mall Loan ($102.7 
million -- 8.0% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 399,000 SF component of a 885,000 SF regional mall located 
in Marlborough, Massachusetts (approximately 27 miles west of Boston). 
The property is anchored by Macy's, JC Penney, and Sears, 
none of which are part of the loan collateral. The largest collateral 
tenants are Regal Cinema (17% of the NRA) and Tilt Arcade (7% 
of the NRA). Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 90% and 1.17X, 
respectively, compared to 92% and 1.15X at the last 
review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on twelve P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The transaction contains a group of exchangeable certificates. 
Classes A-S, B and C may be exchanged for Class PST certificates 
and Class PST may be exchanged for the Classes A-S, B and 
C. The PST certificates will be entitled to receive the sum of 
interest and principal distributable on the Classes A-S, 
B and C certificates that are exchanged for such PST certificates. 
The rating on the PST class was affirmed based on the weighted average 
rating factor (or WARF) of its exchangeable classes.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.4% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.6% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's provides a current list of base expected 
losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at 
http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 22, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the August 17, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 4% to $1.34 
billion from $1.39 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 63 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 12% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 56% of the pool. One loan, constituting 
2% of the pool, has an investment-grade structured 
credit assessment.




Four loans, constituting 17% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, the Oakridge Office Park Loan ($15.7 million 
-- 1.2% of the pool) is currently in special servicing. 
The loan is secured by five office properties totaling approximately 315,500 
square feet (SF) in Orlando, Florida. The loan transferred 
to special servicing in June 2014 after several major tenants departed 
and/or downsized at their lease expirations. As of June 2015, 
the property was 48%, the same as last review and compared 
to 87% at securitization. The Special Servicer initially 
entered into a forbearance agreement with the Borrower to reduce payments 
to interest-only with an escalated maturity date of December 2014. 
The Borrower was unable to cure the default, foreclosure was filed 
and a receiver was appointed in February 2015. The special servicer 
indicated that the receiver is currently preparing the property for sale. 
Moody's estimates a moderate loss on this loan.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 98% of the 
pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 99%, 
compared to 98% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 15% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.4%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.69X and 1.07X, 
respectively, compared to 1.72X and 1.07X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the Sunvalley Shopping 
Center Fee Loan ($22.8 million -- 1.7% 
of the pool), which is secured by the leased fee interest associated 
with six parcels of land totaling 68.4 acres located in Concord, 
California. The parcels generate revenue through a ground lease 
to a 1.4 million square foot regional mall which is operated by 
an affiliate of Taubman Centers Inc. The mall anchors are Sears, 
JC Penney, and Macy's. Moody's structured credit assessment 
is aaa (sca.pd), the same as at Moody's last review.




The top three conduit loans represent 28% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Chrysler East Building Loan ($165 million 
-- 12.3% of the pool), which is secured by a 
32-story, 745,000 SF multi-tenant office building 
within the Grand Central office market of New York, New York. 
The loan sponsor is Tishman Speyer Properties. Several leases expired 
in 2014 and 2015 including the two largest tenants at securitization, 
Credit Agricole (19% of the NRA) and Grant Thorton (8% of 
the NRA). Both tenants vacated the property, however, 
Credit Aricole was already subleasing its space and the majority of its 
original space has been re-leased. Property performance 
has declined since securitization and the property was 81% leased 
as of April 2015 compared to 96% at securitization. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 123% and 0.75X, respectively, 
compared to 113% and 0.81X at Moody's last review.




The second largest loan is the Millennium Boston Retail Loan ($105 
million -- 7.8% of the pool), which is secured 
by nine commercial condominium units contained within three buildings, 
totaling 282,000 SF of mixed use space in the Midtown/Theater District 
area of downtown Boston, Massachusetts. The properties are 
100% leased to nine tenants, including Loews Theater, 
The Sports Club/LA, and CVS. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 85% and 1.02X, respectively, compared to 
87% and 0.99X at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Solomon Pond Mall Loan ($104.7 
million -- 7.8% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 399,000 SF component of a 885,000 SF regional mall located 
in Marlborough, Massachusetts (approximately 27 miles west of Boston). 
The property is anchored by Macy's, JC Penney, and Sears, 
none of which are part of the loan collateral. The largest collateral 
tenants are Regal Cinema (17% of the NRA) and Tilt Arcade (6% 
of the NRA). Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 92% and 1.15X, 
respectively, compared to 93% and 1.13X at the last 
review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed due to the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes. 
The rating on the exchangeable class PST was affirmed due to the credit 
performance (or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of its referenced 
classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.6% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.2% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.5% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.2% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach to 
Rating Fusion U.S. CMBS Transactions" published in April 
2005. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




On October 9, 2014, Moody's issued a "Request for Comment" 
asking for market feedback on proposed changes to the methodology it uses 
to rate conduit and fusion CMBS transactions. If Moody's adopts 
the new methodology as proposed, the changes could affect the ratings 
of MSBAM 2013-C7. Please see "Request for Comment: 
Proposed Enhancements to Our Approach to Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion 
CMBS", which is available at www.moodys.com, 
for more information about the implications of the proposed changes to 
the methodology on Moody's ratings.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v 
2.64, which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. 
Conduit model results at the Aa2 (sf) level are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Conduit model results at the 
B2 (sf) level are based on a paydown analysis using the individual loan-level 
Moody's LTV ratio. Moody's may consider other concentrations 
and correlations in its analysis. Based on the model pooled credit 
enhancement levels of Aa2 (sf) and B2 (sf), the required credit 
enhancement on the remaining conduit classes are either interpolated between 
these two data points or determined based on a multiple or ratio of either 
of these two data points. For fusion deals, Moody's 
merges the credit enhancement for loans with investment-grade Structured 
Credit Assessments with the conduit model credit enhancement for an overall 
model result. Moody's incorporates negative pooling (adding 
credit enhancement at the Structured Credit Assessment level) for loans 
with similar Structured Credit Assessments in the same transaction.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 22, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the September 17, 2014 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 2% to $1.37 
billion from $1.39 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 64 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 12% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 55% of the pool. One loan, constituting 
2% of the pool, has an investment-grade structured 
credit assessment.




Four loans, constituting 5% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, constituting 1% of the pool, is currently 
in special servicing. The specially serviced loan is the Oakridge 
Office Park Loan (for $16 million -- 1% of 
the pool), which is secured by five properties totaling approximately 
315,000 square feet of office space in Orlando, FL. 
Several major tenants have departed at lease expiration and the property 
was 48% occupied as of July 2014. The Special Servicer has 
approved terms for a short-term forbearance to provide the borrower 
with time to lease up the collateral.




Moody's received full year 2013 operating results for 99% of the 
pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 98%, 
compared to 99% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with Structured Credit Assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 8% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.72X and 1.07X, 
respectively, compared to 1.70X and 1.05X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the Sunvalley Shopping 
Center Fee Loan ($23 million -- 2% of the pool), 
which is secured by a 1.4 million square foot ground lease in Concord, 
California. The ground lease covers 68 acres and teh mall anchors 
are Sears, JC Penney, and Macy's. The loan sponsor 
is Taubman Realty Group L.P. Moody's structured credit assessment 
is aaa (sca.pd), the same as at Moody's last review.




The top three conduit loans represent 28% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Chrysler East Building Loan ($165 million 
-- 12% of the pool), which is secured by a 
32-story, 745,000 SF multi-tenant office building 
within the Grand Central office market of New York, New York. 
The loan sponsor is Tishman Speyer Properties. Major tenants include 
Credit Agricole S.A. (Moody's Senior Unsecured Rating A2, 
negative outlook) and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 113% and 0.81X, 
respectively, the same as at Moody's last review.




The second largest loan is the Millennium Boston Retail Loan ($107 
million -- 8% of the pool), which is secured 
by nine commercial condominium units contained within three buildings, 
totaling 282,066 SF of mixed use space in the Midtown/Theater District 
area of downtown Boston. The loan sponsor is Millennium Partners. 
The properties are 100% leased to nine tenants, including 
Loews Theater, The Sports Club/LA, and CVS. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 87% and 0.99X, respectively, 
compared to 88% and 0.98X at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Solomon Pond Mall Loan ($107 million 
-- 8% of the pool), which is secured by a 399,266 
SF component of a 884,758 SF regional mall located in Marlborough, 
MA situated approximately 27 miles west of Boston. The loan sponsors 
are Simon Property Group, Inc., Canadian Pension Plan 
Investment Board, and Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association 
of America. The property is anchored by Macy's, JC Penney, 
and Sears; however, the anchors are not part of the collateral. 
Regal Cinema is the property's largest tenant. Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR are 93% and 1.13X, respectively, 
compared to 95% and 1.11X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party 
assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments related to the monitoring of this transaction 
in the past six months.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes, Classes X-A and X-B, 
were affirmed based on the credit performance of their referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.2% 
of the current balance. Moody's base expected loss plus realized 
losses is now 2.2% of the original pooled balance. 
Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit 
and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://v3.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255. 





FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach to 
Rating Fusion U.S. CMBS Transactions" published in April 
2005. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v 
2.64, which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. 
Conduit model results at the Aa2 (sf) level are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Conduit model results at the 
B2 (sf) level are based on a paydown analysis using the individual loan-level 
Moody's LTV ratio. Moody's may consider other concentrations 
and correlations in its analysis. Based on the model pooled credit 
enhancement levels of Aa2 (sf) and B2 (sf), the required credit 
enhancement on the remaining conduit classes are either interpolated between 
these two data points or determined based on a multiple or ratio of either 
of these two data points. For fusion deals, Moody's 
merges the credit enhancement for loans with investment-grade credit 
assessments with the conduit model credit enhancement for an overall model 
result. Moody's incorporates negative pooling (adding credit 
enhancement at the credit assessment level) for loans with similar credit 
assessments in the same transaction.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 22, 
the same as at securitization.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the December 17, 2013 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1% to $1.38 
billion from $1.39 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 64 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 12% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 55% of the pool. 
One loan, constituting 2% of the pool, has an investment 
grade credit assessment.




Three loans, constituting 4% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool and no loans are in special 
servicing.




Moody's received full year 2012 operating results for 100% of the 
pool and full or partial year 2013 operating results for 83% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 99%, 
compared to 101% at securitization. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with credit assessments, defeased and CTL 
loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 6% to 
the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.4%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.70X and 1.05X, 
respectively, compared to 1.70X and 1.03X at securitization. 
Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The loan with a credit assessment is the Sunvalley Shopping Center Fee 
Loan ($24 million -- 1.7% of the pool). 
The loan is secured by a 1.4 million square foot (SF) ground lease 
in Concord, California. Major tenants include Sears Holding 
Corp. (Moody's Senior Unsecured Rating B3, stable outlook), 
Penney (J.C.) Corporation, Inc. (Moody's 
Senior Unsecured Rating Caa2, negative outlook), and Macy's, 
Inc. (Moody's Backed Senior Unsecured Rating Baa3, positive 
outlook). The loan sponsor is Taubman Realty Group L.P. 
Moody's credit assessment is Aaa, the same as at securitization.




The top three performing conduit loans represent 28% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Chrysler East Building Loan ($165 
million -- 12% of the pool), which is secured by a 32-story, 
745,000 SF multi-tenant office building within the Grand 
Central office market of New York, New York. The loan sponsor 
is Tishman Speyer Properties. Major tenants include Credit Agricole 
S.A. (Moody's Senior Unsecured Rating A2, stable outlook); 
Grant Thornton; and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 113% and 0.81X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization.




The second largest loan is the Millennium Boston Retail Loan ($108 
million -- 8% of the pool). The loan is secured by 
nine commercial condominium units contained within three buildings, 
totaling 282,066 SF of mixed use space in the Midtown/Theater District 
area of downtown Boston. The loan sponsor is Millennium Partners. 
The properties are 100% leased to nine tenants, including 
Loews Theater, The Sports Club/LA, and CVS. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 88% and 0.98X, respectively, 
the same as at securitization.




The third largest loan is the Solomon Pond Mall Loan ($108 million 
-- 8% of the pool). The loan is secured by secured 
by a 399,266 SF component of a 884,758 SF regional mall located 
in Marlborough, MA situated approximately 27 miles west of Boston. 
The loan sponsors are Simon Property Group, Inc., Canadian 
Pension Plan Investment Board, and Teachers Insurance and Annuity 
Association of America. The property is anchored by Macy's, 
JC Penney, and Sears; however, the anchors are not part 
of the collateral. Regal Cinema is the property's largest 
tenant. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 95% and, 
1.11X, respectively, compared to 96% and 1.10X 
at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party 
assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments related to the monitoring of this transaction 
in the past six months.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

    401(k) Fee Transparency: Best & Worst Providers  
As the DOL’s fee transparency rules take effect, Research and Dalbar rank retirement plans on their compliance













On the surface, it may seem like just another onerous, costly government drill: The Department of Labor’s new ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) 408(b) (2) disclosure rule. It mandates that 401(k) plan service providers and others furnish plan sponsors with highly detailed transparency disclosures, especially concerning fees—or face enforcement consequences.
But the impact of the new regulations could be market-changing for the entire 401(k) industry.

Under the new regulations, enforcement is expected to become aggressive, a big change from the spotty activity of the past. Whistle-blowing is encouraged, and those not complying will be penalized. Sponsors are exempt from “regulatory action,” Dalbar notes, “merely by reporting service provider failures.” That can be conveniently accomplished via an online reporting system. 
Based on the technical requirements of 408(b) (2), Dalbar’s Transparency Analysis evaluated and ranked recordkeepers and others according to parameters of: overall usefulness, cost estimates, description of services, fiduciary status and conflicts of interest.













“Revenue sharing is that the expenses of the fund have been subsidizing the administrative costs of the plan,” says Ed O’Connor, managing director-retirement services at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in Purchase, N.Y. “Generally, plan sponsors like that because they want to show employees fund performance, not account fees being charged.”
O’Connor adds: “But if the rule leads to no revenue sharing, and fund expenses do not subsidize administrative costs, what we’ll have are account fees, with participants paying directly for things like online series.” 













BB&T’s disclosure has a unique summary of plan services with a succinct explanation of each plan-option’s benefits for both sponsors and employees. John Hancock opens with a three-page outline of services and a hard-to-miss presentation of costs and compensation. TIAA-CREF uses reader-friendly language and includes an educational introduction.
Other mandated information zeroes in on the critical issue of fiduciary responsibility. But the new government directive concerning that is “cloaked in mystery,” Dalbar says, “since, technically, only fiduciaries are required to make a disclosure.” Therefore, when not stated, plan sponsors have no way of knowing if a service provider is or is not a fiduciary. That information, for example, could have been left out accidentally.

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.
