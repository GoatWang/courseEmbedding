Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Daily Fund distribution rate is the amount, expressed as a percentage, a Fund investor would receive in distributions if the most recent Fund distribution stayed consistent going forward divided by the applicable Fund’s public offering price per share as of the date indicated.  A portion of our distribution has been comprised of a return of capital because certain Fund investments have included preferred and common equity investments, which may include a return of capital. To calculate the quarterly distribution, the Fund’s management will take the income received from the Fund's portfolio, subtract expenses and divide the result by the total number of shares the Fund's investors own. The yield represents a single distribution from the Fund and does not represent the total returns of the Fund. A portion of our distribution has been comprised of a return of capital because certain Fund investments have included preferred and common equity investments, which may include a return of capital. Distributions are not guaranteed. Global Traded REIT Equity is a common stock investment in a publicly traded REIT that owns and operates income-producing real estate. REIT Equity is traded on major stock exchanges and has voting rights. Real Estate Credit is an investment in a real estate company through a loan obligation, which typically includes instruments such as commercial mortgage backed security, preferred equity and bonds. This investment may benefit from a higher claim on the assets and earnings of a company than common equity, does not have voting rights, and pays a fixed distribution with a yield usually above that of common equity. Private Real Estate Equity consists of actively managed real estate equity investments in an unlisted format, typically through a fund or trust. This includes private equity real estate funds and investments in non traded REITs. An Interval Fund is a continuously offered, closed-end mutual fund that periodically offers to repurchase its shares from shareholders. This feature allows the Fund greater opportunities to invest in less liquid assets, which may result in higher risk-adjusted returns. Through the interval structure, the Fund offers a Liquidity Feature of quarterly redemptions at NAV of no less than 5% of the shares outstanding made available, redeeming more frequently than other real estate and private equity investments. Correlation is a measure of the degree to which the value of different investment types move in the same direction; if they perform independently of one another, they are non-correlated. Net Asset Value (NAV) represents the underlying value of shares. The NAV of the Fund’s shares is the market value of the Fund’s assets and is the price at which the shares can be purchased before the addition of any applicable sales charges. An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other information, please call (866) 773-4120 or download the file from www.RREDIF.com. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest. The Fund is distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc. Resource Real Estate, Inc., ALPS Distributors, Inc. and Union Bank, N.A. are not affiliated. Investing involves risk. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Alternative investment funds, ETFs, interval mutual funds and closed-end funds are subject to management and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. Preferred securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Convertible securities are typically issued as bonds or preferred shares with the option to convert to equities. As a result, convertible securities are hybrids that have characteristics of both bonds and common stocks and are subject to risks associated with both debt securities and equity securities. Issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments, resulting in losses to the Fund. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities. The use of leverage, such as borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the Fund’s gains or losses. There currently is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. Limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the Fund’s quarterly repurchase offers. Investments in lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations. The Fund will not invest in real estate directly, but because the Fund will concentrate its investments in securities of REITs, its portfolio will be significantly impacted by the performance of the real estate market. There are risks associated with REITs. Risks include declines from deteriorating economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property, and defaults by borrowers. The sales of securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund’s NAV.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
