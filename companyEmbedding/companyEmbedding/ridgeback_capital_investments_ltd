Company Profile
Cara Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. It is developing a class of product candidates that target the body’s peripheral nervous system and have demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe pain without inducing many of the undesirable side effects associated with available pain therapeutics. It is also developing an oral version of CR845, or Oral CR845, for acute and chronic pain, for which it has completed a Phase I clinical trial to demonstrate the ability to deliver CR845 orally. Its CR845 is a peripherally-acting kappa opioid receptor aganist that it is developing for treatment of both acute and chronic pain. Its product candidate, I.V. CR845, is being developed for the treatment of acute pain in a hospital setting.

Form 13G is used when the filer owns between 5% and 20% of the company and plans to hold it only as a passive investor. If the filler intend to exert control and if the stake’s size exceeds 20%, then a 13D must be filed. Therefore, activist investors and practices such as: hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events, are not permitted by 13G filers.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Prima BioMed (ASX:PRR) is receiving a $15 million investment from U.S. specialist healthcare investor Ridgeback Capital Investments to fund commencement of two new clinical trials of its IMP321 treatment for cancer.This consists of an immediate placement of about 72 million shares priced at $0.0173 each to raise $1.25 million and a lump sum cash investment of about A$13.75 million for consideration of an issue of convertible notes which will be convertible into Prima ordinary shares at $0.02.Ridgeback has a track record of successful investments in a number of US and European immunotherapy companies including Adaptimmune Therapeutics, Bellicum, Cellectis, Medigene and Trillium.The company also plans to start a Share Purchase Plan to raise up to $5 million.When used in conjunction with first-line chemotherapy in cancer patients, IMP321 has been shown to double the clinical response rate compared to chemotherapy alone.It has also been trailed at much lower doses as an adjuvant to cancer vaccines.
