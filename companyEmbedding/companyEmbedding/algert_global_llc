OBJECTIVE TO BE
BEST-IN-CLASS IN SYSTEMATIC EQUITY






PIONEER IN QUANTITATIVE EQUITY
MODELING AND PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION






INDEPENDENT, 100% EMPLOYEE OWNED










ENTER

















OUR HISTORY
CEO Peter Algert established the firm with the goal of becoming recognized as "best-in-class" in systematic active equity investing. Founded in 2002 and 100% employee-owned, Algert Global focuses on managing global absolute return and active long-only strategies for both institutional and private investors.  The core investment team has worked together since 2004 and each member can demonstrate a deep academic background in quantitative investing.  Prior to creating Algert Global, Peter served as the Global Head of Research for Barclays Global Investors' stock selection strategies.












OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY
We believe there are inefficiencies in global equity markets that result from the behavioral biases of human market participants and are best exploited by a quantitative and repeatable investment process.
Our process utilizes three manifestations of market inefficiencies in conjunction with one another to develop a single conviction (alpha score) on every stock in our investment universe.










 
Markets mis-estimate company growth rates.
 
As a result, we look to own companies that we believe are cheap relative to peers.







 
Markets inefficiently forecast the sustainability of firm earnings.
 
As a result, we look to own companies whose earnings, we believe, will be sustainable.







 
 
Markets often react irrationally to new information.
 
As a result, we look to own companies for which market sentiment and attention is increasing such that we believe the market is likely to converge to our viewpoint and price.
 










RELATIVE VALUE








QUALITY








CATALYST












INVESTMENT PROCESS
We employ a systematic, fundamental investment process to derive a proprietary stock ranking for each company within our respective investment universe.

The Alpha Scores represent our view of the attractiveness of the company relative to its industry peers
Our stock rankings are updated every day through seven distinct regional modeling processes that run around the clock
Hundreds of daily processes accumulate and store new information from our numerous data sources and re-estimate our ranking for each stock in our universe

Using the updated stock rankings, our portfolios are automatically optimized and a prospective trade list is generated, reviewed and approved by a model manager prior to submitting to the market for execution.  We implement these ideas systematically, removing emotion from any buy and sell decisions.










RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management is intrinsically part of our investment process.  Every signal we produce is “neutralized” to the key risk factors we wish to manage: e.g. beta, countries, industries, and size. Our final stock ranking is designed to be free from any bias or tendency to overweight or underweight these risk factors.
In addition, our portfolio construction and trading process overlays several additional risk management controls:
 

We use an optimizer to build our portfolio from our stock score, risk exposures and covariances, and liquidity and transaction cost forecasts. The goal of the optimization is to maximize our portfolio’s exposure to our proprietary stock ranking without taking excessive risk to common factors for which we have no forecast
We bound positions according to both their proportion of the portfolio and their percentage of daily liquidity
Prior to trading, the model manager reviews the trade list for any news that might have invalidated the stock ranking for a given stock (e.g. an announced takeover). The model manager has limited discretion only to take risk “off the table” in these circumstances.







TECHNOLOGY
As a pioneer in quantitative equity modeling and portfolio construction, Algert Global invests heavily in data and the development of systems to analyze equities and manage portfolios.  We were data scientists long before the phrase became popular, and have built a highly scalable and efficient platform that leverages our team’s capabilities in research, risk modeling and portfolio management.  Over three hundred automated processes are managed each day to integrate data feeds from our vendors and update our models.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
