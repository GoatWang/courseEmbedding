FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Earnings Growth Research: KAR Auction Services, Inc. (KAR), American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO)

By Homer Porter -   July 24, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of KAR Auction Services, Inc. (NYSE:KAR) observed rebound of 10.04% since bottoming out at $38.16 on Nov. 08, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 3.17% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -1.48% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -10.72% from $47.03 , the 52-week high touched on Feb. 15, 2017, but are collecting gains at -0.85% for the past 12 months.
KAR Target Price Reaches $50.88
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy KAR Auction Services, Inc. (KAR)’s shares projecting a $50.88 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly KAR Auction Services, Inc. (KAR)’s Sales Grew?
 KAR’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 10.8% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 14.3% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Achieves Above-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, KAR Auction Services, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 7.06%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 3.18%, and the sector’s average is 11.8%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers but weakness can be witnessed when compared with the sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (NYSE:AEO) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -39.44% since hitting a peak level of $19.55 on Aug. 15, 2016. Thanks to an increase of almost 6.76% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -21.95% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 12.12% higher from $10.56, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on May. 19, 2017, but are collecting gains at -20.86% for the past six months.
Analysts See American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. 1.05% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO) to grow. At recent closing price of $11.84, AEO has a chance to add $1.05 or 8.87% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($12.89) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.9 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.05 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (NYSE:AEO) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 5.3%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but more headwinds are coming as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go down by -1.65%, annually.
Is AEO Turning Profits into Returns?
 American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO)’s ROE is 17.97%, while industry’s is 10.95%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 13.36%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.’s ROA is 12.21%, while industry’s average is 5.31%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 6.74. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.
