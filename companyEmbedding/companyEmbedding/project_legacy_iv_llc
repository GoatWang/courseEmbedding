Management Services

Leasing / Retention
Legacy Partners has the most qualified, best-trained and experienced property management team in the industry. We’re known for our commitment to creating a first-class living atmosphere while maximizing resident occupancy and satisfaction.
We do this by offering our associates up-to-date, in-house multifamily industry training and education programs. Workshops, as well as online and in-person classes, are offered in a wide range of topics, including: customer service, communication and personal development, property operations, maintenance, leadership, sales, leasing and marketing.


New Developments
Legacy Partners has been a trendsetter and industry leader with new community lease-up assets. In strong and weak markets, for all grades of communities, Legacy Partners strives to outperform expectations.


On-Site Management
Property Management is key to investment success. We strive to maintain high occupancy levels, physical asset integrity and financial strength. Legacy Partners’ experienced property management teams are supported by a comprehensive computerized operating system that generates up-to-the-minute cash flow analysis and financial statements for every community we manage. We also use industry-leading accounting and management technology, revenue management systems and utility revenue services.


Maintenance / Asset Preservation
In addition to managing the community, Legacy Partners knows it is essential to properly maintain every asset. Each of our communities has a maintenance team that specializes in day-to-day service requests, repairs and ongoing maintenance needs. We offer Asset Preservation Services that help provide a strategic plan and outline to guide our clients in determining what is essential in continuing to keep the property at its best – whether it be paint, flooring, parking slurry, appliance replacement, or renovations.


Resident Relations
Our residents want communities that enhance their style of living, improve their comfort and create the feeling of home. We do this by offering various customer programs, resident events, and most importantly, putting our customers’ needs first. We consistently make the Ellis Shopping Report as one of the top companies in the nation in achieving the platinum level of benchmark scores for mystery shops.


Renovations / Repositioning
Legacy Partners works hand in hand with owners and asset managers to determine goals and realize substantial NOI gains for upgraded or repositioned properties. We have decades of development and construction experience in the multifamily industry. Our tenured management team can assist with research, analysis, re-design, market repositioning, and temporary resident relocation processes prior to and during asset renovation.


Due Diligence / Assessment
Whether a community is being purchased or a site is being considered for development, Legacy Partners has local expertise and can quickly react and respond to market demands. Our analysis may include the following:

Exterior Site Inspection
Community and Apartment Inspections
Safety Evaluations
Environmental Issue Evaluation
Budget — Review of history and forecast
Financial Feasibility Economic Analysis
Government Approvals
Market Analysis
Design Coordination
Cable/Internet/Phone Contract Negotiations
Legal Evaluation
Construction Management
Community Branding and Marketing



Asset Management
Legacy Partners is proficient and well practiced at managing and operating multifamily real estate assets. In fact, we’ve managed most of the properties we have developed, seeing many through to their successful disposition. Thanks to our fiscal strength and access to capital markets, we have completed complex financing arrangements and created venture relationships with some of the biggest investors in the industry.
