Chris Melton







 





Objective



Applying my business and product marketing skills, education, and experience within the footwear & biotech industry, to contribute to the success of the corporation and its entities.





Summary



Greetings -
I am currently exploring marketing, product management and business operations openings in the Boston area with hopes of finding a company that I can grow with for years to come.
I have an MBA with a Marketing concentration from Assumption College (2008). Most recently I was in the APLM role (men’s, women’s, kid’s & toddler’s) in the One Star franchise of Converse (Nike, Inc), sold in Target stores. However, with no PLM to report to, I owned the responsibilities of both the PLM and APLM. With both FP&A and P&L expertise as well as Product Management experience in both the Biotech and Footwear industries, I have the business strategy as well as the product creation and development experience needed to succeed in today's fast paced business culture.
I would appreciate the opportunity to interview very soon.
Thanks in advance for your time and consideration.
Best Regards,
Christopher Melton
