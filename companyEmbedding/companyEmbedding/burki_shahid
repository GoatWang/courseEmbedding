List of Pakistani provinces by gross domestic product

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This is a list of provinces of Pakistan by their gross state product (GSP) (the value of the total economy, and goods and services produced in the respective province) in nominal terms. GSP is the provincial-level counterpart of the national gross domestic product (GDP), the most comprehensive measure of a country's economic activity.

Dynamics[edit]
Pakistan, as of 2016, had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $304 billion US$[1]. This value can be further divided into the provincial levels (GSP), providing an outlook of how much value each province contributes to the national GDP. Pakistan has traditionally followed a "top-down" approach in its analysis of economic development; that is, authorities have scarcely attempted to break up national GDP statistics into provincial and subnational units and have focused more on the federation as a whole. Thus, many accounts of provincial GDPs that do exist have usually been projected estimates made by economists, based on the likely percentage of contribution of the respective province to the national GDP and some yearly studies.
As of 2016, Punjab had the largest economy in Pakistan (contributing 53.3% to Pakistan's GDP), followed by Sindh (29%), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (9%) Balochistan (3.65%) Azad Kashmir(2.3%) and Gilgit-Baltistan (1.5%) respectively. Islamabad, the capital entity, contributes about 1%; while FATA contribute 0.5% according to economist.[2]
Punjab, which is the largest province in terms of population, dominates other provinces in contributing to the national economy. As of 2016, Punjab had a GDP of $162 billion[3] which has steadily continued to grow. It is featured well within the list of country subdivisions with a GDP over $100 billion. Sindh's GDP with 88 billion is to a large extent influenced by the economy of Karachi, its capital and Pakistan's largest city.

                              - as its short yet turbulent history vividly demonstrates. The nation's search for stability is traced in this revised and
                              updated introduction to Pakistan's political, economic, and social development. New chapters detail political developments
                              since 1991, including the elections of 1993 and 1996. Particular attention is paid to economic changes, including the financial
                              crisis that led to the fall of Benazir Bhutto's government in 1996. Also included is an extensive analysis of the nuclear
                              arms race between India and Pakistan, an issue of global concern."--Jacket

                              This third Annual Bank Conference on Development in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) focuses on trade liberalization
                                 policy, specifically "open regionalism," a term coined to describe the fact that 1) regionalism has gone hand in hand with
                                 unilateral trade opening:statistics on tariff and non-tariff measures affecting imports show that protectionist policies have
                                 been dismantled in the major LAC countries during the last decade; 2) regionalism has gone hand in hand with a substantial
                                 liberalization of investment regimes:provisions, including national treatment provisions, in regional trading arrangements
                                 show that several LAC countries treat foreign direct investment on exactly the same footing as domestic investment; and 3)
                                 most LAC countries are willing to participate in building a hemispheric free-trade zone and have been active, pro-liberalization
                                 members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Speeches emphasized the political returns from trade integration:reciprocal
                                 lock-in, alliances created among pro-reform factions, pro-integration movements across countries, civil society integration,
                                 more-likely peaceful settlements to disputes, and general advancement of harmony in the Western Hemisphere through atmospherics,
                                 through positive incentive structures, and through cross-country coalitions. Because these positive linkages are largely implicit
                                 and not unduly burdensome, they make regional integration consistent with convergence toward global trade integration

                           "Although Pakistan achieved independence in 1947, it still has not succeeded in integrating its diverse peoples into a nation
                              - as its short yet turbulent history vividly demonstrates. The nation's search for stability is traced in this revised and
                              updated introduction to Pakistan's political, economic, and social development. New chapters detail political developments
                              since 1991, including the elections of 1993 and 1996. Particular attention is paid to economic changes, including the financial
                              crisis that led to the fall of Benazir Bhutto's government in 1996. Also included is an extensive analysis of the nuclear
                              arms race between India and Pakistan, an issue of global concern."--Jacket

                              This third Annual Bank Conference on Development in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) focuses on trade liberalization
                                 policy, specifically "open regionalism," a term coined to describe the fact that 1) regionalism has gone hand in hand with
                                 unilateral trade opening:statistics on tariff and non-tariff measures affecting imports show that protectionist policies have
                                 been dismantled in the major LAC countries during the last decade; 2) regionalism has gone hand in hand with a substantial
                                 liberalization of investment regimes:provisions, including national treatment provisions, in regional trading arrangements
                                 show that several LAC countries treat foreign direct investment on exactly the same footing as domestic investment; and 3)
                                 most LAC countries are willing to participate in building a hemispheric free-trade zone and have been active, pro-liberalization
                                 members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Speeches emphasized the political returns from trade integration:reciprocal
                                 lock-in, alliances created among pro-reform factions, pro-integration movements across countries, civil society integration,
                                 more-likely peaceful settlements to disputes, and general advancement of harmony in the Western Hemisphere through atmospherics,
                                 through positive incentive structures, and through cross-country coalitions. Because these positive linkages are largely implicit
                                 and not unduly burdensome, they make regional integration consistent with convergence toward global trade integration

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Shimla, formerly known as Simla, in (then-British) India on 14 September 1938, Burki migrated as a child along with his family to Pakistan at the time of the independence of Pakistan in September 1947. They settled in Rawalpindi, where his father worked as an official in the Pakistan army headquarters. Burki is a cousin of the cricketer Javed Burki. Burki was educated at Rawalpindi's Presentation Convent and St Mary's Academy. Upon graduation he moved to Lahore to study double majors in Physics and Mathematics at Government College University, Lahore. He received his MSc in Physics from the Punjab University in 1959. The following year he was chosen as a Rhodes Scholar from Pakistan and went to Christ Church, Oxford to study economics. He received his MA from Oxford in 1963 and then went to Harvard University as a Mason Fellow for graduate studies in Economics and Public Administration. He holds dual Pakistani and US nationality.[1]
Career at World Bank[edit]
Burki joined the World Bank in 1974 as a Senior Economist and went on to serve in several senior positions. He was the (first) Director of the China Department (1987–1994), making him responsible for managing the World Bank's dialogue with the Chinese authorities and supervising all of the Bank's analytical and lending work in China. He persuaded the World Bank's senior management, in the immediate aftermath of the Chinese authorities' repression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, that the Bank should stay actively engaged with China—a stance challenged at the time by many of the Bank's most powerful shareholder countries. He served as the Regional Vice-President for Latin America and the Caribbean during 1994–1999. He took a leave of absence from the World Bank to serve in a caretaker role as Pakistan's de facto Finance Minister for 67 days in 1996–1997 (exercising the responsibilities of the Finance Minister without assuming the title). He retired from the World Bank in 1999.
Publications[edit]
Burki is the author or editor of several books on Pakistan, including: Pakistan Under Bhutto (1980, Macmillan); Pakistan under the Military: Eleven Years of Zia Ul-Haq (with Craig Baxter, 1991, Westview Press); Pakistan: Fifty Years of Nationhood (1999, Westview Press); A Historical Dictionary of Pakistan (1999, Scarecrow Press); and Changing Perceptions, Altered Reality: Pakistan's Economy under Musharraf, 1999–2006 (2007, Oxford University Press, Karachi). Other publications on development include: A Study of Chinese Communes (1969, Harvard University Press); First Things First (with Paul Streeten, 1981, Oxford University Press); and Transforming Socialist Economies: Lessons from Cuba and Beyond (edited, with Daniel P. Erikson, 2005, Palgrave Macmillan).[2]
Other activities[edit]
Burki writes an opinion piece for a Pakistani newspaper (Dawn) once a week. He is also a frequent contributor of opinion pieces to the Daily Times.
Burki is Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Institute of Public Policy in Lahore, Pakistan.

Upon graduation he moved to Lahore to study double majors in Physics and Mathematics at Government College University, Lahore. He received his MSc in Physics from the Punjab University in 1959. The following year he was chosen as a Rhodes Scholar from Pakistan and went to Christ Church, Oxford to study economics. He received his MA from Oxford in 1963 and then went to Harvard University as a Mason Fellow for graduate studies in Economics and Public Administration. He holds dual Pakistani and US nationality.[1]
Career at World Bank[edit]
Burki joined the World Bank in 1974 as a Senior Economist and went on to serve in several senior positions. He was the (first) Director of the China Department (1987–1994), making him responsible for managing the World Bank's dialogue with the Chinese authorities and supervising all of the Bank's analytical and lending work in China. He persuaded the World Bank's senior management, in the immediate aftermath of the Chinese authorities' repression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, that the Bank should stay actively engaged with China—a stance challenged at the time by many of the Bank's most powerful shareholder countries. He served as the Regional Vice-President for Latin America and the Caribbean during 1994–1999. He took a leave of absence from the World Bank to serve in a caretaker role as Pakistan's de facto Finance Minister for 67 days in 1996–1997 (exercising the responsibilities of the Finance Minister without assuming the title). He retired from the World Bank in 1999.
Publications[edit]
Burki is the author or editor of several books on Pakistan, including: Pakistan Under Bhutto (1980, Macmillan); Pakistan under the Military: Eleven Years of Zia Ul-Haq (with Craig Baxter, 1991, Westview Press); Pakistan: Fifty Years of Nationhood (1999, Westview Press); A Historical Dictionary of Pakistan (1999, Scarecrow Press); and Changing Perceptions, Altered Reality: Pakistan's Economy under Musharraf, 1999–2006 (2007, Oxford University Press, Karachi). Other publications on development include: A Study of Chinese Communes (1969, Harvard University Press); First Things First (with Paul Streeten, 1981, Oxford University Press); and Transforming Socialist Economies: Lessons from Cuba and Beyond (edited, with Daniel P. Erikson, 2005, Palgrave Macmillan).[2]
Other activities[edit]
Burki writes an opinion piece for a Pakistani newspaper (Dawn) once a week. He is also a frequent contributor of opinion pieces to the Daily Times.
Burki is Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Institute of Public Policy in Lahore, Pakistan.
