This means creating an offering that echoes in the customers’ consciousness as a great deal for them. Why? Because the value provided serves customers best interests. In so doing, a business succeeds, attracts new customers, and is able to continually improve the value offered to existing customers. Value Based Marketing for Bottom Line Success provides a 5-step model and critical tools necessary for creating and managing a successful Value Delivery marketing strategy. Customers buy value, not product or features. They buy from the company that provides the most value. And they buy what’s in their best interest. Consequently, the secret to customer retention and growing value relationships with customers is to always make it in their best interest to do business with you by providing the best value in the marketplace. Value Based Marketing for Bottom Line Success: 5 Steps to Creating Competitive Value offers a Value Creation and Delivery process which will help a company to compete profitably in its marketplace by: 1) identifying the value expectations of target customers; 2) selecting the values on which it wants to compete; 3) analyzing the ability within the organization to deliver that value; 4) communicating the value & selling the value message; 5) delivering the value promised & improving the company’s value model. A value-focused strategy, by definition, isn’t a mass marketing strategy; it’s a targeted laser strategy directed at chosen value segments that are profitable for the supplier. This text offers a customer value creation model, which shows how to create and sustain competitive advantage while delivering customer value and offers a method for quantifying customer lifetime value (CLV), which enables a company to identify which customer value segments it should target.  Anteprima libro » Cosa dicono le persone - Scrivi una recensioneNessuna recensione trovata nei soliti posti.Pagine selezionatePagina del titoloIndiceIndiceCHAPTER 1 THE VIEW FROM PENTADIGMS WORLD1 CHAPTER 2 INTRODUCTION TO PENTADIGM17 DISCOVERUNDERSTAND THE CUSTOMER33 COMMITCOMMIT TO THE CUSTOMER53 CREATECREATE CUSTOMER VALUE77 ASSESSOBTAIN CUSTOMER FEEDBACK99 IMPROVEMEASURE AND IMPROVE VALUE115 CHAPTER 8 MANAGING PENTADIGM139 APPENDIX 3 CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE CLV171 APPENDIX 4 PENTADIGM COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT179 APPENDIX 5 VALUE COMMITMENT RATING TOOL185 APPENDIX 6 DEVELOPING CUSTOMER VALUE COMMITMENTS THAT ARE REAL AND SUPERIOR195 APPENDIX 7 PENTADIGM VALUEBASED MARKETING DIAGNOSTIC199 NOTES231 INDEX235 ABOUT THE AUTHORS243 AltroAPPENDIX 1 PENTADIGM ROAD MAPS161 APPENDIX 2 TARGET CUSTOMER VALUE SEGMENT TRACER167 Copyright RiduciAltre edizioni - Visualizza tuttoValue-Based Marketing for Bottom-Line SuccessJ.
