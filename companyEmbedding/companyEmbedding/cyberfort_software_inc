	CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION



	 


	This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Report”) contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not historical facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “may,” “seek,” “plan,” “might,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “project,” “forecast,” “potential,” “continue” negatives thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various underlying assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.


	 


	We cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that the results or conditions described in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are found at various places throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations, including statements about potential acquisition or merger targets; business strategies; future cash flows; financing plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements regarding future acquisitions, future cash needs, future operations, business plans and future financial results, and any other statements that are not historical facts.


	 


	These forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.


	 


	Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or otherwise.


	 



	CERTAIN TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT



	 


	All references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the terms “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company”, “Cyberfort” and the “Registrant” refer to Cyberfort Software, Inc. unless the context indicates another meaning.

	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION



	 


	On September 26, 2016, the board of Directors and the majority shareholders of the Patriot Berry Farms, Inc. approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to change its name from Patriot Berry Farms, Inc. to Cyberfort Software, Inc. The name change has been affected prior to the filing of this report. Cyberfort Software, Inc., (“Cyberfort” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 2010 under the name of Gaia Remedies, Inc. The main focus of the Company is the development of security software technology. This will result in a total rebranding and change in industry sector which the Company operates.


	 



	NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 


	Interim Accounting


	 


	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three month period and nine month period ended December 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended March 31, 2017.


	 


	The Company's 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, filed on September 7, 2016, should be read in conjunction with this Report.


	 



	USE OF ESTIMATES



	 


	The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company.


	 



	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS



	 


	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with original maturities of less than three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. The Company had $26 and $0 in cash as of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.

	NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $3,850,405 and $2,569,399, respectively. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the next twelve months.


	 


	The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing. In response to this and other potential problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 



	NOTE 4 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS



	 


	On September 20, 2016, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement with Ferlin Corp. to assume a Purchase and Sale Agreement between Ferlin Corp and Mistrin Pty, Ltd. that results in the Company effectively purchasing the title, rights, and interest to a software application, (including the source code) in exchange for various consideration. Under the Assignment and the assumed Purchase and Sale Agreement with Mistrin, the Company has assumed a Note Payable to Mistrin for $150,000, will issue 10,688,588 shares of common stock, valued at $0.085 per share, to the seller, assignor, and various individuals, and received $40,000. Consequently, the Company has recorded intangible property related to the transaction of $1,018,530. The Company has not fully issued all the required shares of common stock at this time. They will issue the shares as soon as practicable. However, the Company has treated all shares as issued and outstanding within these financial statement.


	 


	Per the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company was required to make a $50,000 payment related to the assumed Note Payable on September 25, 2016. As of the date of this filing the Company has yet to make the required payment and is in Material Breach of said agreement. Additionally, the Purchase and Sale Agreement obligates the Company to hire several identified individuals, fund $10,000 of marketing and development cost per month, and migrate the acquired technology into an Enterprise Class security software product prior to being able to begin the effort of generating revenue. During the nine month ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $32,000 marketing and development expenses.


	 


	The Company is in negotiations with the Assignor and Seller to amend the various agreements to enable the Company to raise additional funds in order for the Company to accomplish the execution of its current business plan. There are no guarantees that the Company will be able to renegotiate the agreements, raise the required funds, or successfully execute its business plan.


	 


	Consequently, the Company determined that the acquired intangible property’s value was impaired as of September 30, 2016, due to the material breach and significant uncertainties related to its business plan and has written off the entire value of the intangible property at that date.

	NOTE 7 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)

The stock based compensation expenses were recognized over the service period.


	 


	On July 7, 2016, the current President advanced $29,000 to pay certain accounts payable on behalf of the Company. On July 29, 2016, the Company issued 290,000 shares of Company’s common stock to its current President to reimburse $29,000 paid on behalf of the Company.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




	 


	This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other reports filed by Cyberfort Systems, Inc. (the “Company”) from time to time with the SEC (collectively, the “Filings”) contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company’s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company’s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company’s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including the risks relating to the Company’s business, industry, and the Company’s operations and results of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.


	 


	Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.


	 


	Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.


	 



	Overview



	 


	Cyberfort Software, Inc., formerly Patriot Berry Farms, Inc (“Cyberfort” or the “Company”). was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 2010 under the name of Gaia Remedies, Inc.). On December 27, 2012, a change in control occurred as a director of the Company purchased 54,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company. On January 28, 2013, the Company changed its name to Patriot Berry Farms, Inc.


	 


	On May 15, 2013, the Company began implementation of its new business plan: the acquisition and operation of established and profitable berry farms throughout the United States. The Company’s main focus is on blueberry production with a secondary focus on strawberry and raspberry production.


	 


	In August, 2013, the Company hired a Director of Farming and entered into an agreement, wherein the Company will pay a fee of $5,000 per month to the director for a period of 24 months in exchange for assistance in identifying, underwriting, and negotiating the terms of potential farm acquisitions on the Company’s behalf. Further, the director will assist the Company in the development of its operations and distribution, amongst other responsibilities. Upon the expiration of the initial 24 months of the director’s agreement’s term, the Company will ascertain if an increase in the monthly fee is warranted.


	 


	In November, 2013, the Company acquired the Morningstar Farm, an operational blueberry farm in Levy County, Florida.

	On April 4, 2014, the Company, through Douglas Harmon, who was the Company’s Farm Manager of the Morningstar Farm entered into the Sale Agreement with Dole Berry Company. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, Dole was acting as the exclusive sales agent of the Company to market and sell all of the blueberries produced by the Grower from the Farm for a period of five (5) harvest years beginning January 1, 2014 until December 31, 2018 unless terminated earlier. The Company received advances equal to $1.00 per pound of finished product weight each week minus receiving and handling charges, as well as 10% commission that was paid to Dole. The Company was due to pay to the Mr. Harmon a commission equal to 2% of the revenues from the sales of finished products, but has since made a settlement within the sale of the farm, which included this payment.


	 


	On July 1, 2014, the Board of Directors and majority shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to change its name from Patriot Berry Farms, Inc. to Patriot Cannabis Farms, Inc.


	 


	 On April 23, 2015, the Company sold the Morningstar Farm to Douglas and Gail Harmon.


	 


	On September 20, 2016, the Company signed an agreement to purchase the intangible property called Vivio. Vivio is an iOS 10 app (available on iTunes) that allows the user to experience the web the way it is supposed to be, faster and cleaner, but without compromising their online safety. Vivio not only removes ads from the websites you visit in Safari, it also saves you data traffic costs up to 50% and makes your battery lasts longer as a result. The acquisition of this software affirms Cyberforts repositioning into the cybersecurity sector.


	 


	The Company is based in San Francisco, California, with principal executive offices located at 388 Market Street, Suite 1300, San Francisco, California 94111 and our telephone number is (415) 295 4507.


	 



	Plan of Operation



	 


	The company’s overall plan is to identify and acquire potential technologies, positioning itself to deal with the various and increasing cyber threats through innovative protection technologies for mobile, personal and business tech devices, stretching across a number of the available platforms.


	 


	There has been a very limited activity within the Company since September 2014 due to the fact that the Company has not been able to secure the necessary financing to sustain its operations.

	Revenues



	 


	During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not generate any revenues.


	 



	Expenses



	 


	We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $113,719 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $43,658 for the corresponding period in 2015. This is primarily due to the increase of $29,672 for professional fees incurred related to regulatory reporting and $30,000 marketing and development expense during the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to same period in 2015.

	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not generate any revenues.


	 



	Expenses



	 


	We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $1,281,006 during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $141,223 for the corresponding period in 2015. This is mainly due to an impairment of intangible property of $1,018,530, $76,049 for professional fees incurred related to regulatory reporting and $32,000 marketing and development expense during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 compared to same period in 2015.


	 



	Gain on settlement of debt



	 


	During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, the Company had $12,000 in gain on settlement of debt.


	 



	Net Loss



	 


	We incurred a net loss of $1,281,006 during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $129,223 for the corresponding period in 2015.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	Since its inception, the Company has financed its cash requirements from the sale of common stock and advances from related party. Uses of funds have included activities to establish our business, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses.


	 


	We believe the Company will need additional resources to implement its strategic objectives in upcoming quarters. Due to our lack of operating history, however, our auditors have stated their opinion that there currently exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $3,850,405. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the next twelve months.


	 


	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations. In response to this and other potential problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.




	 


	In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, our Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”) and Principal Financial Officer (“PFO”) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our PEO and PFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.


	 




	(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.




	 


	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.

	Item 5. Other Information.




	 


	On September 20, 2016, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement with Ferlin Corp., to assume a Purchase and Sale Agreement between Ferlin Corp and Mistrin Pty, Ltd. that results in the Company effectively purchasing the title, rights, and interest to a software application,(including the source code) in exchange for various consideration. Under the Assignment and the assumed Purchase and Sale Agreement with Mistrin, the Company has assumed a Note Payable to Mistrin for $150,000, will issue 10,688,588 shares of common stock to the seller, assignor, and various individual, and received $40,000. Consequently, the Company has recorded intangible property related to the transaction of $1,018,530.


	 


	Per the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company was required to make a $50,000 payment related to the assumed Note Payable on September 25, 2016. As of the date of this filing the Company has yet to make the required payment and is in Material Breach of said agreement. Additionally, the Purchase and Sale Agreement obligates the Company to hire several identified individuals, fund $10,000 of marketing and development cost per month, and migrate the acquired technology into an Enterprise Class security software product prior to being able to begin the effort of generating revenue. The Company is in negotiations with the Assignor and Seller to amend the various agreements to enable the Company to raise additional funds in order for the Company to accomplish the execution of its current business plan. There are not guarantees that the Company will be able to renegotiate the agreements, raise the required funds, or successfully execute its business plan.


	 


	Consequently, the Company determined that the acquired intangible property’s value impaired as of September 30, 2016, due to the material breach and significant uncertainties related to its business plan and has written off the entire value of the intangible property at that date.


	 


	On September 28, 2016, the Company entered into four consulting agreements with consultants to act in the role of Technology Development Manager, Chief Technology Officer, Corporate Development Officer, and Advisory Director. The term of each agreement shall be one year and shall be a rolling contract until terminated or extended. The Company shall issue each consultant a total of 200,000 shares of common stock per annum to a total of 800,000 shares per annum.


	 


	On October 18, 2016, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada and changed its name from Patriot Berry Farms, Inc. to Cyberfort Software, Inc.


	 


	On November 15, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced the Company's name and symbol change and it effective November 16, 2016. The Company will trade under its new name, Cyberfort Software, Inc. under the symbol CYBF.

GlobeNewswire



Sep 28, 2016 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































 SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Patriot Berry Farms Inc. (OTCQB:PBFI) is pleased to announce completion of the initial steps required in order to enter the Cyber Security industry, commencing with a name change application, filed with the SEC on September 15 th 2016. The company will soon be known as Cyberfort Software Inc. and will target the $122.45 billion 1 Cyber Security market, starting with its purchase of an innovative iOS and MacOS privacy and security application.  Patriot Berry Farms Becomes Cyberfort Software Inc. The company has initiated the name-changing process, a transition designed to help Cyberfort Software position itself in the Cyber Security market. The complete transition process is expected to be completed by October 14 th 2016, with a new ticker symbol to be announced in due course.  Moving into The Ever-Expanding Cyber Security MarketAs the Cyber Security market continues to grow and is expected to top $200 billion 1 over the next five years, the company will immediately start to refine and develop its initial software, whilst working to nurture and grow new technologies in order to realize Cyberfort's market share in this exciting sector. Commenting on the new direction, Daniel Cattlin, CEO, said: "We are extremely pleased to announce this new acquisition and change of direction. We believe this is a tremendous opportunity to grow in such an exciting sector, we've secured an incredible technology and we're seriously excited."  Purchasing and Developing New IPsCyberfort Software Inc. has now signed an agreement to acquire its first Cyber Security IP. This first acquisition, known as "Vivio," is an innovative Artificial Intelligence(AI)-driven application, enhancing the security and privacy of users by focusing on Ad-Blocking and Content Filtering. The Vivio app enables users to experience browsing the web faster and cleaner, without compromising their online safety. Vivio not only removes ads from the websites users visit in Safari, it also has been shown to save on data traffic and roaming data traffic costs up to 50% and as a result allows longer battery life of portable devices. Cyberfort will immediately begin utilizing Vivio´s existing users as base to test and develop a suite of enterprise tools and security solutions.    Hiring Cyber Security ExpertsAlong with its initial acquisition, Cyberfort aims to launch a strategic hiring campaign to bring in talent from a variety of Cyber Security and IT development companies. The company will soon announce a list of new employees as well as industry leading advisory board members.  New Headquarters Location and Online PresenceCyberfort has relocated its headquarters to the heart of the high-tech industry and is now based in San Francisco, California. The company has just completed a new website containing all the information pertaining to the team, new IP acquisitions, market positioning, future developments and investor information.

By stepping up our initial plans/timeframes we will in the future be able to provide our customers with increased security and peace of mind, in order for them to operate safely while online."Introductions to Senior Advisors and Management: The company also wishes to provide further detailed information on each of the four key senior advisory and management professionals that each brings with them a wealth of expertise and knowledge:Harish Doddala - Senior Advisor: Doddala brings 9 Years of Product Management and Software Engineering experience delivering results for Cisco, VMware, Oracle, IBM and Siemens.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
