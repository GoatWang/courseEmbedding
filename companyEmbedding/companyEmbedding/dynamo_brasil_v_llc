Dash's Brazilian players excited for Marta's NWSL arrival

Back to Gallery
















The news of Marta's signing with the Orlando Pride last week sent shockwaves throughout women's soccer circles. It especially hit home for Andressa and Poliana – two of the Dash's three Brazilian players.
The five-time World Player of the Year and all-time leader in World Cup goals scored is perhaps the greatest player in the history of the sport. She has scored 358 goals in 321 professional appearances and 106 more goals in 109 appearances with the Brazilian national team.



Andressa and Poliana have played with Marta on the national team. They said it is great news for her to play in the NWSL.
"As a fan of the game and someone from Brazil, the more that I see Brazilians in the league the better it is for us who are coming here and trying to grow the game, not just here but in our country as well," Andressa said through a translator.
Andressa said Marta is a vocal leader who often organizes individual meetings to make sure everybody is on the same page. She also praised Marta's energy and leadership.




 (Story continues below ... )






Andressa and Poliana have seen first-hand that Marta's influence on the game goes beyond Brazil's borders. Now soccer fans in the United States will get to see her up close.
Orlando visits Houston for the first time on June 17.
"She is someone you want to play for," Andressa said. "She is someone who brings everyone together. She is someone you look to as an example of who you aspire to be as a player because of what she has done and what she means to the national team."
