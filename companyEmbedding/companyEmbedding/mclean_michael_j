 Educational Background



 


Georgia Institute of Technology

                  The Georgia Institute of Technology is a public research university in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States. It is a part of the University System of Georgia and has satellite campuses in Savannah, Georgia; Metz, France; Athlone, Ireland; Shanghai, China; and Singapore.

The educational institution was founded in 1885 as the Georgia School of Technology as part of Reconstruction plans to build an industrial economy in the post-Civil War Southern United States. Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a trade school to a larger and more capable technical institute and research university.

Today, Georgia Tech is organized into six colleges and contains about 31 departments/units, with emphasis on science and technology. It is well recognized for its degree programs in engineering, computing, business administration, the sciences, architecture, and liberal arts.

Michael J. McLean




  Black Diamond


Mr. McLean has been affiliated with Zija International for over two years now. In that time he and his family have not only transformed their lives physically with Zija's world-class products, but they have also been able to build the foundation for a very solid business, attaining the rank of Black Diamond in just a little over a year. One of the biggest lessons he has learned is that the key to success in this business is simplicity. His favorite products are Améo Frankincense oil, AGX Men, SuperMix, and XMburn. When he is not out sharing, teaching, and training, he loves to spend time with his family in the woods.
