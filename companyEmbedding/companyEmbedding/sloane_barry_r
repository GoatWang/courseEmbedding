Barry R. Sloane


A Family Banking Heritage


An Interview with Barry R. Sloane, President and Chief Executive Officer, Century Bancorp


Editors’ Note
Barry Sloane has been a director of the company and Century Bank and Trust Company since 1997. He is President and CEO of Century Bancorp and President and CEO of Century Bank and Trust Company. Sloane is also Chair & Treasurer of the Fisher Center at Rockefeller University, a Trustee of the Massachusetts General Hospital, and a trustee of the Savings Bank Employee Retirement System (SBERA).
Company Brief
Century Bancorp, Inc. (centurybank.com), through its subsidiary bank, Century Bank and Trust Company, is a state-chartered full-service commercial bank, operating 26 branches in the Greater Boston area, and offering a complete range of business, personal, and institutional services.
What is the heritage of Century Bancorp and how has it evolved?
Century Bank was founded by my father Marshall in 1969. He still comes to work almost every day. We’re proud of him and his legacy, and my sister, Linda, and I carry that legacy on.
We are the largest family-controlled bank remaining in New England – we’re about $3.6 billion today and we have 26 branch offices in Eastern Massachusetts.
There is a dichotomy now in the banking business between the giant and the regional institutions. There are many differences between them, but the distinction that is most apparent is between providing first-rate face-to-face service and solely self-service automation.
We have tried to offer a world-class platform for both, so we emphasize our people-to-people service while building as sophisticated an automated platform as any of our peers. Yet, my father, sister, and I are always completely available to customers.
Simultaneously, we run an extremely centralized decision-making process for lending and, for most customers, borrowing is the core of their banking relationship. I sign off on every loan at the bank. This provides me with a level of understanding and contact with our customers that is unrivalled among our peers.
Following my father’s tradition means we’re here in the office almost all the time. We are responsible for understanding people’s needs and acting swiftly on them.
How do you avoid losing the family feel when you grow to a certain size?
It is an obsession with us. We have 440 total employees and about 100 officers, and we train them to know that when they see a client problem that needs our involvement, they pick up the phone and solve problems quickly in an empowered way.
You need to have a decision-making structure that efficiently profiles credits and gets applications to the decision-making level with little delay.
Part of this is the technology platform for receiving applications, doing basic analysis on loan applications of all sizes, and getting them prepared for a decision. At the end of that process, it’s still a dedicated banker analyzing a situation and making a quick decision.
We’re conservative when it comes to lending, which is why we avoided the credit crisis almost completely.
How broad is your client profile?
We have 27,000 client households, many for decades. There are three businesses here: one-third is the traditional and vibrant consumer sector; one-third is our lending business to small business, middle-market enterprise, and the largest segment now is lending to not-for-profit organizations, largely education and healthcare; and one-third is what we call Institutional Services, payment processing, lockbox services, and cash management.
We’re in our fifth record year of assets, deposits, earnings, and loans, so we’ve been fortunate.
One of the key issues now arising is around virtual branches and what those mean: device versus facility; banker versus Facebook. My father still feels strongly that people need to see the bank where their money is, but we have begun a new effort to explore virtual branches.
Another important technology innovation is the video teller machine, a large ATM that includes a video communication capability, potentially a huge line-extension for geography and business hours.
Are you competing against just the regional players or also the larger banks?
Fortunately, most of the giants place very little emphasis on the personal relationship. By policy, they rotate their branch people, particularly their branch managers, oftentimes in less than a year. 
We take pride in having branch managers in place sometimes for over 20 years – this is how they get to know their customers and the community.
It’s all about hiring people who are interested in a career of continuity and geographic permanence, incenting and encouraging them, and making sure the product specialists have a similar attitude.
When we see a loan application that isn’t perfect, if they’re a good, loyal customer, we will bend in their direction.
How have you attracted talent?
The family feel has been enormously important. We have never had a layoff in 45 years. People know when they come here that we will do our best to meet their expectations over the long term, and that we will assure them a career of continuity. They project that to their clients and they’re proud to be working here, and they respect the ethic of serving the communities in which the bank was founded.
Is it sometimes difficult to live up to expectations?
I walk in very large shoes every day and my mission is not to trip. This is a public company but it’s a family-controlled organization and that means that, substantively, we need to have a clear understanding of the strategy of the business and its future.
Temperament is critical – those who do well in banking have the right time horizon and the proper understanding of the limits to growth. We are a capital-anchored industry and there is nothing more important to the investment community, the regulatory overseers, and ultimately to our clients than that we are well-capitalized at all times, as we are. We understand the pace of the growth process. I have grown up with it.
How important is community engagement for the bank?
We have a large philanthropic effort, which is very relationship-based. We’re fortunate to have over 100 significant charitable organizations that bank with us and we try to reciprocate those relationships appropriately.
The marvel of Greater Boston in 2014 is that it’s such a diversified city and philanthropy crosses all income, ethnic, and religious lines.
Are there opportunities to broaden into new markets?
The best growth for us is organic and the best markets at this time are those we’re in.
Geographically, we’re not interested in growing our footprint outside of driving distance to Boston because that’s the basis of our marketing efficiency.
Over the past few decades, the number of independent banks has shrunk dramatically, but we think there will always be a place for person-to-person service supported by a first-rate technology platform.•

             Frequently asked questions Q:What is pre-approval?A: A pre-approval from your bank outlines the loan amount you 
          may be able to borrow and helps your real estate agent focus your search 
          on properties you will likely qualify to purchase. Century Bank provides 
          this service at no cost to you. Q:How long is the mortgage application process?A: Once your application is received, it typically takes 30 to 
          45 business days to close on the loan. Q:What are the advantages of a Fixed Rate 
          Mortgage?A: With a fixed rate mortgage your monthly principal and 
          interest payment will never increase during the life of the loan. Q:What are the advantages of an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage 
          (ARM)?A: An ARM may come with a lower monthly payment amount than a 
          fixed rate mortgage, which means you may qualify for a larger mortgage. Q:Why would I want a Fixed Rate Mortgage vs. ARM?A: The type of mortgage you choose depends on your needs when 
          you are buying a home. A Century Bank lending expert will help you 
          understand the best mortgage for your situation. Q:What is a down payment?A: The down payment on the purchase of a home is the amount of 
          cash you pay up front with the bank financing the remainder of the 
          purchase price. Your Century Bank lending expert will discuss all loan and 
          down payment options available to you. Q:What is Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)? A: PMI is required when your down payment is less than 20% of 
          the purchase price of a home. Your Century Bank lending expert will tell 
          you if this insurance applies to your situation and, if so, will estimate 
          the cost for you. Q:What is an appraisal? A: An appraisal is a report on a property’s estimated value 
          made by a certified appraiser. When you apply for a Century Bank mortgage 
          loan, we will initiate the appraisal process for you. Q:What is escrow? A: Escrow is an account the bank holds in your name for amounts 
          collected monthly along with your mortgage payments to cover taxes and/or 
          insurance. When these obligations are due, the bank makes the payments for 
          you. Q:What is a point? A: A point is 1% of a mortgage amount, paid by the borrower to 
          obtain the mortgage. Most of Century Bank’s loans do not come with points. Q:What are closing costs?A: Closing costs are the fees and expenses associated with a 
          mortgage transaction. The fees may include appraisal, credit report, 
          attorney services, title insurance, and points, if applicable. Your 
          Century Bank lending expert will provide you with an estimate of these 
          costs when you submit your loan application. Q:What is a home inspection? A: A home inspection is optional but always a good idea. As the 
          buyer of a property, you hire a professional home inspector to examine it 
          and identify potential problems with the infrastructure that you should be 
          aware of before you agree to complete the purchase. Q:What is a jumbo loan? A: A jumbo loan is a mortgage that exceeds the maximum loan 
          amount established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan 
          Mortgage Corporation). Jumbo loans are also referred to as non-conforming 
          loans. Q:Does Century Bank offer special programs for first-time home 
          buyers? A: Yes, let your Century Bank lending expert know that you’re 
          buying your first home because you may qualify for special programs that 
          could include more flexible lending criteria.  Century Bank is pleased to provide FREE pre-qualifications. Simply 
    select the borrowing product you are most interested in and complete the 
    application to the best of your ability. One of our loan officers will then 
    contact you shortly.  Bounce Limits  Type of Account  Overdraft Bounce Protection Limit*  Platinum Checking  $2,500  Gold Checking  $2,000  Silver Checking  $1,000  Bronze Checking  $1,000  18/65 Checking  $1,000  Bonus Free Checking  $3,000  Business Basic Checking  $3,000  Regular Business Checking  $3,000  * These figures may be reflected in your available 
    balance. Account fees may reduce available bounce protection.  Overdraft Bounce Protection Practices  We clear items drawn against your account in the following order: (a) 
    electronic transactions (electronic funds transfers, pre-authorized debits, 
    debit card transactions, ATM transactions or other withdrawal requests); and (b) 
    checks or other payments. If you maintain your checking account in good standing 
    (defined as making regular deposits and bringing your account to a positive 
    balance at least once every 30 days) and there are no legal orders outstanding, 
    we may approve your reasonable overdraft. You may opt out of the privilege at 
    any time by calling our Customer Service Center at (866) 823-6887, stopping by 
    one of our conveniently located branches, or visiting www.CenturyBank.com and 
    selecting the “contact us” tab to opt out of our overdraft Bounce Protection 
    service. However, you are responsible for any overdrawn balances at the time of 
    opting out. The amount of any overdraft plus our insufficient funds fee that you 
    owe us shall be due and payable upon demand. If there is an overdraft paid by us 
    on an account with more than one (1) owner on the signature card, each owner and 
    agent, if applicable, drawing/presenting the item creating the overdraft, shall 
    be jointly and severally liable for such overdraft plus our normal insufficient 
    funds fee.  Limitations: Overdraft Bounce Protection is available to individually/ 
    jointly owned and business accounts in good standing. Accounts of those under 
    eighteen years of age are not eligible for the overdraft Bounce Protection 
    product. Century Bank reserves the right to limit participation to one account 
    per household or business and to discontinue this service without prior notice. 
    The overdraft Bounce Protection program will not be available to new checking 
    accounts until the account has been opened for 30 days and during that time, 
    deposits to the account must be 80% of the predetermined limits of overdraft 
    Bounce Protection assigned to that account type.   You are about to send information over the internet. It might be

       FAQs regarding your Century Bank Debit MasterCard
    

Q: What�s the difference between selecting �Debit� or �Credit�?


       A: With �Debit,� you enter your Personal Identification Number (PIN). With �Credit,� you don�t, which makes the transaction that much safer. Either way the money is taken directly out of your checking account.
    

Q: But if I press or say �credit,� does that make it a credit card transaction?


       A: No. With your Century Bank Debit MasterCard, the money comes out of your checking account.
    

Q: How can I get cash?


       A: Ask the merchant if �Cash Back� is a service they provide. Or get cash at a Century Bank ATM and at more than 1 million ATMs which display the MasterCard, Cirrus, NYCE or SUM logos.
    


 




        Frequently Asked Questions






Q:


What is pre-approval?




A:


                    A pre-approval from your bank outlines the loan amount you may be able to borrow and helps your real estate agent focus your search on properties you will likely qualify to purchase. Century Bank provides this service at no cost to you.
                    



Q:


How long is the mortgage application process?




A:


                    Once your application is received, it typically takes 30 to 45 business days to close on the loan.
                    



Q:


What are the advantages of a Fixed Rate Mortgage?




A:


                    With a fixed rate mortgage your monthly principal and interest payment will never increase during the life of the loan.
                    



Q:


What are the advantages of an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)?




A:


                    An ARM may come with a lower monthly payment amount than a fixed rate mortgage, which means you may qualify for a larger mortgage.
                    



Q:


Why would I want a Fixed Rate Mortgage vs. ARM?




A:


                    The type of mortgage you choose depends on your needs when you are buying a home. A Century Bank Borrowing Specialist will help you understand the best mortgage for your situation.
                    



Q:


What is a down payment?




A:


                    The down payment on the purchase of a home is the amount of cash you pay up front with the bank financing the remainder of the purchase price. Your Century Bank Borrowing Specialist will discuss all loan and down payment options available to you.
                    



Q:


What is Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)? 




A:


                    PMI is required when your down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price of a home. Your Century Bank Borrowing Specialist will tell you if this insurance applies to your situation and, if so, will estimate the cost for you.
                    



Q:


What is an appraisal? 




A:


                    An appraisal is a report on a property�s estimated value made by a certified appraiser. When you apply for a Century Bank mortgage loan, we will initiate the appraisal process for you.
                    



Q:


What is escrow? 




A:


                    Escrow is an account the bank holds in your name for amounts collected monthly along with your mortgage payments to cover taxes and/or insurance. When these obligations are due, the bank makes the payments for you.
                    



Q:


What is a point? 




A:


                    A point is a percentage of a mortgage amount, paid by the borrower to obtain the mortgage. Most of Century Bank�s loans do not come with points.
                    



Q:


What are closing costs?




A:


                    Closing costs are the fees and expenses associated with a mortgage transaction. The fees may include appraisal, credit report, attorney services, title insurance, and points, if applicable. Your Century Bank lending expert will provide you with an estimate of these costs when you submit your loan application.
                    



Q:


What is a home inspection? 




A:


                    A home inspection is optional but always a good idea. As the buyer of a property, you hire a professional home inspector to examine it and identify potential problems with the infrastructure that you should be aware of before you agree to complete the purchase.
                    



Q:


What is a jumbo loan? 




A:


                    A jumbo loan is a mortgage that exceeds the maximum loan amount established by Fannie Mae (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation). Jumbo loans are also referred to as non-conforming loans.
                    



Q:


Does Century Bank offer special programs for first-time home buyers? 




A:


                    Yes, let your Century Bank�Borrowing Specialist�know that you�re buying your first home because you may qualify for special programs that could include more flexible lending criteria.
                    








       Century Bank is pleased to provide FREE pre-approvals. Simply select the borrowing product you are most interested in and complete the application to the best of your ability. One of our loan officers will then contact you shortly.

Overdraft Bounce Protection Practices
We clear items drawn against your account in the following order:
(a) electronic transactions (electronic funds transfers, pre-authorized debits, debit card transactions, ATM transactions or other withdrawal requests); and (b) checks, in numerical sequence with lower numbers paid first, and other payments. If you maintain your checking account in good standing (defined as making regular deposits and bringing your account to a positive balance at least once every 30 days) and there are no legal orders outstanding, we may approve your reasonable overdraft. You may opt out of the privilege at any time by calling our Customer Service Center at (866) 823-6887, stopping by one of our conveniently located branches, or visiting CenturyBank.com and selecting the �contact us� tab to opt out of our overdraft Bounce Protection service. However, you are responsible for any overdrawn balances at the time of opting out. The amount of any overdraft plus our insufficient funds fee that you owe us shall be due and payable upon demand. If there is an overdraft paid by us on an account with more than one (1) owner on the signature card, each owner and agent, if applicable, drawing/presenting the item creating the overdraft, shall be jointly and severally liable for such overdraft plus our normal insufficient funds fee.
Limitations: Overdraft Bounce Protection is available to individually/ jointly owned and business accounts in good standing. Accounts of those under eighteen years of age are not eligible for the overdraft Bounce Protection product. Century Bank reserves the right to limit participation to one account per household or business and to discontinue this service without prior notice. The overdraft Bounce Protection program will not be available to new checking accounts until the account has been opened for 30 days and during that time, deposits to the account must be 80% of the predetermined limits of overdraft Bounce Protection assigned to that account type.
