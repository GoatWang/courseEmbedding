	                      "I wanted to 
	                      thank you for getting the new telephone batteries to us so soon!. We 
	                      were having phone problems and the quick service was appreciated. I 
	                      purchase many things from websites and once many of them have the order 
	                      they don't seem to worry about how long it takes for the products to 
	                      arrive... I really appreciate the follow-up to my status request email 
	                      and that the batteries arrived even sooner than we had planned."

Overview & Details






Samsung 7.5 cu. ft. 6200-Series Front-Load Electric Dryer with Multi-Steam Technology
Have it your way... With 12 preset drying cycles, 5 temperature settings and 11 options, this dryer lets you  set it and forget it! Unlike other steam dryers that require you to manually refill a water reservoir, this dryer requires no refills. You can confidently steam away wrinkles and spend less time ironing. Moisture sensors detect when laundry has reached the optimal degree of dryness. They help protect your laundry from heat damage by automatically shutting off the dryer when your clothes are dry. Laundry day isn't such a daunting task, any more, is it?

What You Get 


Samsung dryer 
User's manual 
Manufacturer's 1-year warranty parts, labor and control board 


Good to Know







For product support or inquiries, please contact Samsung at 1-800-726-7864 or www.samsung.com.


 
Washers and dryers use a 3- or 4-prong 240-volt outlet, not a standard 120-volt outlet. We recommend hiring a professional to ensure your wall outlet is wired properly.
