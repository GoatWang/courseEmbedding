STONEHAM, Mass., Aug. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- CIRCADIAN®, the global leader in managing 24/7 workforce productivity, health and safety in businesses that operate around the clock, announced today that it has acquired a controlling stake in ZircLight Inc. with a $2.5 million Series A investment led by ams AG, a leading designer and manufacturer of sensor and analog solutions including sensor-integrated intelligent managers that are enabling the next generation of smart lighting systems.
ZircLight Inc., which will operate as CIRCADIAN ZircLight, holds the core intellectual property rights to devices including LED lighting systems, eyewear and display screens that alleviate the negative health and performance effects of artificial lighting in our nighttime environments by controlling nocturnal exposure to specific blue light wavelengths that stimulate melanopsin receptor visual pathways and cause neuroendocrine disruption (including melatonin and cortisol), and disease marker gene disruptions (including BMal1 and Per2). 
Dr. Martin Moore-Ede, the CEO of CIRCADIAN commented, "The ZircLight technology, using circadian-modulated spectrum-specific LEDs, provides a highly effective solution to nocturnal workplace lighting exposure, and a healthy alternative to the blue-pump LED lighting that is currently flooding the market. We seek to provide the energy-saving and technology advantages of LED lighting without the considerable downside risks of dosing large populations of people with blue wavelengths that have been associated with increased health risks."
"The 2007 decision by the World Health Organization to classify nocturnal light exposure as a "probable carcinogen," and the extensive human epidemiological and animal research studies over the past 10 years demonstrating that nocturnal light exposure increases cancer, diabetes, obesity, heart disease and depression, has brought public attention to this very real health hazard," explained Dr. Doros Platika, Chairman of CIRCADIAN ZircLight.
Sajol Ghoshal, Vice President, Strategic Development, Sensor Technology & Wireless Connectivity at ams AG, added, "ams is very excited about the coming wave of sensor–driven technological solutions to the health and wellness challenges that have been created by our modern environment. We see circadian modulated lighting as an important application for ams intelligent sensors that opens entirely new dimensions in the concept of high quality light, and will be the hallmark of the smart lighting revolution."

		CIRCADIAN Light
			








CIRCADIAN® Light is producing intelligent circadian white light fixtures which regulate the dosage and timing of bio-active blue light to increase human health and productivity throughout the 24/7 day-night cycle.
The initial CIRCADIAN® Light products are fully autonomous light fixtures that can be installed by any qualified electrician and regulate the timing of the bio-active blue light by time of day, season of the year and zip code (i.e. latitude and longitude) for up to 10 years without requiring any changes or additional input. They are specifically designed to boost productivity and decrease absenteeism, turnover, errors, and accidents in workplaces that operate around the clock.
By controlling the bio-active blue dosage, the proprietary CIRCADIAN® LEDs reduce the harmful spectral wavelengths that have been associated with an increase of 35-65% in obesity, diabetes, heart disease, sleep disorders, depression, reproductive disorders and multiple cancers, including breast cancer and prostate cancer. CIRCADIAN® Lights solve the night lighting problem by providing high quality white light 24/7, and avoid the dimming and low color temperature approaches used by other so-called “circadian” lighting products, which do not sufficiently reduce the bio-active blue dosage.
When the dark side of energy efficient light was recognized by the World Health Organization, American Medical Association, and National Institutes of Health, among others, CIRCADIAN was among the first to recognize the implications for the 24/7 employers and workforce, and to start finding the solutions. Our discoveries have enabled a practical solution to the LED lighting problem and resulted in an extensive IP portfolio.
CIRCADIAN Light products incorporate insights generated by over a decade of breakthrough biomedical research conducted at leading universities, including University of Toronto. 
CIRCADIAN is unique in the lighting industry in having an in-house 24/7 workplace simulation within a medical research center. In the CIRCADIAN Light Center, people live and work and sleep under spectrally-specific lighting to enable the development of optimal lighting products. We measure the impact of the light spectrum on blood, urine and saliva hormones, disease markers, blood pressure, and sleep to define the optimal scheduling of bio-active light dosage.
This world-class facility has been critical in optimizing the light spectra to improve performance, decrease errors, and reduce the probability of fatigue related accidents. As our slogan says we are truly delivering the “24-Hour Spectrum of Health.”

ABOUT CIRCADIAN®
CIRCADIAN Light is a member of the worldwide CIRCADIAN® group of companies, bringing health, productivity and safety solutions to the 24/7 business workplaces around the globe. Born out of breakthrough research on human circadian clocks at Harvard Medical School, CIRCADIAN has led in the transition of medical science breakthroughs into the 24/7 workplace. We are unique in deeply understanding both the science, and the practical realities of 24/7 work.For over 30 years, CIRCADIAN® has been the leading global provider of health, safety and productivity solutions to the 24/7 operations of over half the Fortune 500 and many other international companies. Our science-based solutions boost productivity, reduce errors and injuries, decrease absenteeism and employee turnover, and reduce health care costs.Headquartered on Route 128, Boston's Technology Corridor, CIRCADIAN serves the 24/7 world, operating out of offices in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
