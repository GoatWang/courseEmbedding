Clark Donald Jeffrey
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Clark Donald Jeffrey carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Clark Donald Jeffrey currently holds license C21341 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Clark Donald Jeffrey



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Clark Donald Jeffrey



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.











What else should I know before hiring Clark Donald Jeffrey



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Who Created the Fake Donald Trump Time Cover Hanging Up at His Golf Courses?Who Created the Fake Donald Trump Time Cover Hanging Up at His Golf Courses?Adam Clark Estes6/27/17 4:11pmFiled to: fake newsdonald trumptime magazinetimesurrealism19713EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkPhoto: GettyGaslighting victims around the world blinked on Tuesday when The Washington Post revealed that a fake Time magazine cover with the president’s face is hanging up at Trump golf courses around the world. Donald Trump’s administration would not explain this glaring example of fake news. The facts lead to even weirder questions.The Time cover in question, featuring Donald Trump, is dated March 1, 2009. The Post reports that a framed version of this image “had been hung in at least four of Trump’s 17 golf clubs” worldwide. The problem, however, is that it’s not real. Time didn’t even publish a magazine on March 1, 2009. And the issue with the nearest publication date, from March 2, 2009, featured Kate Winslet. Look:While the Trump cover has some design inconsistencies (like a thinner red border and an absent inner white line), it also features several of the same headlines as the Winslet cover. However, they’re arranged in a way that’s not consistent with Time’s cover design. “I can confirm that this is not a real TIME cover,” Time Inc. representative Kerri Chyka told the Post.AdvertisementAdvertisementThings get weirder from there. As developer Jordan Merrick pointed out on Twitter, the barcode on the fake cover is assigned to a piece of karaoke DJ software that was on the market in 2009. And while there are other bits of evidence that prove the Trump Time cover is a fake, it’s difficult to figure out who made it, why they made it, and how Trump’s staff decided to hang the falsehood inside the billionaire’s golf clubs.I’ve done my best to do some quick internet sleuthing, and the results suggest that this is all some weird internet satire project gone awry. A Google Image search of the fake Trump cover brings up a couple other fake Time covers with similar designs. One points to an image on Deviant Art depicting Bruce Wayne (the Ben Affleck edition) on a fake cover of Time in some weird posture opposing the presidential run of Lex Luthor. The other points to a fake cover of Time showing Kane, a character from the video game Command & Conquer, as Person of the Year. The same image shows up in a forum discussing Hillary Clinton’s picking Tim Kaine as her vice president from July 2016. While both of the parodies appear to have been created well after March 1, 2009, the associations are undeniably hilarious. Meanwhile, the line on the Trump cover, “The ‘Apprentice’ Is a Television Smash,” doesn’t appear in any article predating the Post’s story, but a similar phrase, “‘The Apprentice’ is a smash,” actually did show up in a Washington Times article from 2004. Not that it necessarily matters, but it is a clue.AdvertisementSo who did it? Who created this fake Donald Trump Time magazine cover and managed to put it in several Trump golf clubs? We need to know. If you have any clues, let me know in the comments or email me. In the meantime, do read The Washington Post’s excellent investigation into this matter. It’s a story you’d only believe if you were alive in the United States in 2017.Update 8:29PM : According to the Washington Post, a spokesperson for Time has asked the Trump Organization to remove all of the fake covers from the walls of Trump properties.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders wrote to the Post in an email, ““We couldn’t comment on the decor at Trump Golf clubs one way or another.” Sanders had a heated exchange with the White House press corps on Tuesday over her repeated accusations of “fake news.” Advertisement[The Washington Post]Adam Clark Estesadam@gizmodo.com@adamclarkestesSenior editor at Gizmodo.PGP Fingerprint: 91CF B387 7B38 148C DDD6  38D2 6CBC 1E46 1DBF 22A8|PGP KeyOTR Fingerprint: D9330D9B 6CF5E271 7FAC6194 DAA9B51B E09A99B2
