Stealthy Vicarious Surgical raises $2.4m – MassDevice










































































 















MassDeviceThe Medical Device Business Journal — Medical Device News & Articles | MassDevice 

Home » Stealthy Vicarious Surgical raises $2.4mStealthy Vicarious Surgical raises $2.4m
February 18, 2016 By Brad Perriello Leave a Comment Stealthy Vicarious Surgical said it raised nearly $2.4 million for the surgical virtual reality software it’s said to be developing.
Cambridge, Mass.-based Vicarious reported the equity offering, which involved 11 unnamed investors, in a regulatory filing yesterday.
Details about Vicarious are scarce. The company’s 1-page website consists of a logo and email address; according to Bloomberg, the company develops virtual-reality software for minimally invasive surgery procedures.
Vicarious Surgical’s co-founders are listed on LinkedIn as CEO Adam Sachs (who is also identified as president in the regulatory filing) and Sammy Khalifa (identified as chief technology officer by Bloomberg).
Reached today via telephone, Sachs declined to immediately comment, saying he wanted to reflect before responding to an enquiry from MassDevice.com.
Vicarious raised an unspecified amount in a private placement last September, according to Bloomberg.
