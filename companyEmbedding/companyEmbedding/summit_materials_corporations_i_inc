Summit Materials













 
  





Materials.











We see opportunity around every corner to help build your community.Sourced from the highest quality sites.
Efficient production for consistency and strength.
Integrated product offering to our customers.
Summit Materials is a vertically integrated construction materials company that produces aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete and asphalt, and offers paving, construction and other services.   These types of products and services touch almost every aspect of your daily life, from the roads you drive to work to the cell phone you use to call home.










Building Materials Fact
Concrete
has been used in some form since Roman times, it is the most universal construction material today.
 











Our Materials.





 

AggregatesAggregates are the building blocks of our nation’s construction industry. These natural resources are the foundation of products and services that develop our public and private infrastructure. The aggregate materials are sourced from our quarries, and are the key materials in production of asphalt, concrete and cement. We stand behind the process and quality from rock to road.
 





 

CementCement, when combined with aggregates and water, produces concrete. Cement is the binder that makes concrete durable, weather resistant and adaptable. Our state of the art cement plant and production process enable our companies and our customers to offer superior concrete products.
 





 

Ready-MixReady-mix is a highly versatile construction material that can be used to make everything from curbs to kitchen counters. Its flexible recipe characteristics allow for an end product that can assume almost any color, shape, texture and strength. Ready-mix concrete can be customized to suit your needs.
 





 

AsphaltAsphalt is one of the most common roadway materials used today; approximately 94 percent of our nation's roads are paved with asphalt. It is formed by the combination of aggregates and liquid asphalt. Asphalt is 100 percent renewable and the U.S. alone recycles nearly 60 million tons of asphalt each year.  
 





 

Paving ConstructionPaving is the final stage of Summit’s vertically integrated product offering. Our companies perform quality work that complements our materials by providing a downstream outlet to distribute these products. Our skilled labor force and quality service offering provide a one stop shop to our customers.
 






Our Process.




Site PlanningA site is chosen to be sustainable throughout and beyond extraction. Before the first stone is removed, we are already planning for the lifecycle of the site.




Safe ExtractionWe partner with our neighbors and our legislators to work responsibly in our environment throughout the extraction process.




Site RepurposingAs the last stone is removed, a site’s lifecycle progresses as it continues to provide communities with varying types of future development.

2. Exchange Offer

(a) Unless the Exchange Offer would

staff of the SEC, each of the Issuers and the Guarantors shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to file with the
SEC one or more Registration Statements (each, an “
Exchange Offer Registration Statement ”) on an
appropriate registration form with respect to a registered offer
(the “ Exchange Offer ”) to exchange any and all
of the Registrable Securities for a like aggregate principal amount
of debt securities of the applicable series of the Issuers (such
debt securities, the “ Exchange Notes ”),
guaranteed, to the extent applicable, on an unsecured senior basis
by the Guarantors, (the “ Exchange Notes Guarantees
” and, together with the Exchange Notes, the “
Exchange Securities ”), that are substantially
identical in all material respects to the Notes except that the
Exchange Notes (i) shall contain no restrictive legend
thereon, (ii) interest thereon shall accrue from (A) the
later of (x) the last date on which interest was paid on such
Notes or (y) if such Notes are surrendered for exchange on a
date in a period that includes the record date for an interest
payment date to occur on or after the date of such exchange and as
to which interest will be paid, the date of such interest payment
date or (B) if no such interest has been paid, from the Issue
Date and (iii) shall be entitled to the benefits of the
Indenture or a trust indenture which is identical in all material
respects to the Indenture (other than such changes to the Indenture
or any such identical trust indenture as are necessary to
comply
 
-5-


with the TIA) and which, in either case, has
been qualified under the TIA. The Exchange Offer shall comply with
all applicable tender offer rules and regulations under the
Exchange Act and other applicable laws. The Issuers and the
Guarantors shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to (x) prepare and file with the SEC the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement with respect to the Exchange Offer and
cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act; (y) keep the Exchange
Offer open for at least 20 Business Days (or longer if required by
applicable law) after the date that notice of the Exchange Offer is
sent to Holders; and (z) consummate the Exchange Offer on or
prior to the 270th day following the Issue Date (or if such 270th
day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business
Day).

Each Holder (including, without
limitation, each Participating Broker-Dealer) that participates in
the Exchange Offer, as a condition to participation in the Exchange
Offer, will be required to represent to the Issuers in writing
(which may be contained in the applicable letter of transmittal)
substantially to the effect that: (i) any Exchange Securities
acquired in exchange for Registrable Securities tendered are being
acquired in the ordinary course of business of the Person receiving
such Exchange Securities, whether or not such recipient is such
Holder itself; (ii) at the time of the commencement or
consummation of the Exchange Offer neither such Holder nor, to the
actual knowledge of such Holder, any other Person receiving
Exchange Securities from such Holder has an arrangement or
understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange
Securities in violation of the provisions of the Securities Act;
(iii) neither the Holder nor, to the knowledge of such Holder,
any other Person receiving Exchange Securities from such Holder is
an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 405) of either
Issuer or any Guarantor or, if it is an affiliate of either Issuer
or any Guarantor, it will comply with the registration and
prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the
extent applicable and will provide information to be included in
the Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with Section 5
hereof in order to have their Securities included in the Shelf
Registration Statement and benefit from provisions regarding
Additional Interest in Section 4 hereof; (iv) if such
Holder is not a broker-dealer, neither such Holder nor, to the
knowledge of such Holder, any other Person receiving Exchange
Securities from such Holder is engaging in or intends to engage in
a distribution of the Exchange Securities; and (v) if such
Holder is a Participating Broker-Dealer, such Holder has acquired
the Registrable Securities for its own account in exchange for
Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making
activities or other trading activities and that it will comply with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act (including, but not
limited to, the prospectus delivery requirements
thereunder).

Upon consummation of the Exchange
Offer in accordance with this Section 2, the provisions of
this Agreement shall continue to apply, mutatis mutandis ,
solely with respect to Registrable Securities that are Private
Exchange Notes (and the related Guarantees), Exchange Securities as
to which Section 2(c)(iv) hereof is applicable and Exchange
Securities held by Participating Broker-Dealers, and the Issuers
and the Guarantors shall have no further obligation to register
Registrable Securities (other than Private Exchange Notes (and the
related Guarantees) and Exchange Securities as to which clause
2(c)(iv) hereof applies) pursuant to Section 3
hereof.

(b) The Issuers shall include within
the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration
Statement a section entitled “Plan of Distribution,”
which shall contain a summary statement of the positions taken or
policies made by the staff of the SEC with respect
 
-6-


to the potential “underwriter”
status of any broker-dealer that is the “beneficial
owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
Exchange Notes received by such broker-dealer in the Exchange Offer
(a “ Participating Broker-Dealer ”), whether
such positions or policies have been publicly disseminated by the
staff of the SEC or such positions or policies represent the
prevailing views of the staff of the SEC. Such “Plan of
Distribution” section shall also expressly permit, to the
extent permitted by applicable policies and regulations of the SEC,
the use of the Prospectus by all Participating Broker-Dealers, and
include a statement describing the means by which Participating
Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities in compliance
with the Securities Act.

Each of the Issuers and the
Guarantors shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep
the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend
and supplement the Prospectus contained therein in order to permit
such Prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all Persons subject to
the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such
period of time as is necessary to comply with applicable law in
connection with any resale of the Exchange Securities;
provided , however , that such period shall not be
required to exceed 90 days after the date on which the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement is declared effective, such period as
extended, if at all, pursuant to the last paragraph of
Section 5 hereof (the “ Applicable Period
”).

If, immediately prior to
consummation of the Exchange Offer, the Initial Purchasers hold any
Notes acquired by them that have the status of an unsold allotment
in the initial distribution, the Issuers, upon the written request
of the Initial Purchasers or any such Holders, as the case may be,
shall simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Notes issue
and deliver to the Initial Purchasers, in exchange (the “
Private Exchange ”) for such Notes held by any such
Initial Purchaser, a like principal amount of notes (the “
Private Exchange Notes ”) of the Issuers, guaranteed
by the Guarantors, that are identical in all material respects to
the Exchange Notes except for the placement of a restrictive legend
on such Private Exchange Notes. The Private Exchange Notes shall be
issued pursuant to the same indenture as the Exchange Notes and
bear the same CUSIP number as the Exchange Notes if permitted by
the CUSIP Service Bureau.

In connection with the Exchange
Offer, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall:

(1) mail, or cause to be mailed, to
each Holder of record entitled to participate in the Exchange Offer
a copy of the Prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of
transmittal and related documents;

(2) use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer open for
not less than 20 Business Days (or longer if required by applicable
law) after the date that notice of the Exchange Offer is sent to
Holders;

(3) utilize the services of a
depositary for the Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York or in Wilmington,
Delaware;
 
-7-



(4) permit Holders to withdraw
tendered Notes at any time prior to the close of business, New York
time, on the last Business Day on which the Exchange Offer remains
open; and

(5) otherwise comply in all material
respects with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the
Exchange Offer.

As soon as practicable after the
close of the Exchange Offer and any Private Exchange, the Issuers
and the Guarantors shall:

(1) accept for exchange all
Registrable Securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Exchange Offer and any Private Exchange;

(2) deliver to the Trustee for
cancellation all Registrable Securities so accepted for exchange;
and

(3) cause the Trustee to
authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of Notes, Exchange
Notes or Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be, equal in
principal amount to the Notes of such Holder so accepted for
exchange; provided that, in the case of any Notes held in
global form by a depositary, authentication and delivery to such
depositary of one or more replacement Notes in global form in an
equivalent principal amount thereto for the account of such Holders
in accordance with the Indenture shall satisfy such authentication
and delivery requirement.

The Exchange Offer and the Private
Exchange shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that
(i) the Exchange Offer or Private Exchange, as the case may
be, does not violate applicable law or any applicable
interpretation of the staff of the SEC; (ii) no action or
proceeding shall have been instituted or threatened in any court or
by any governmental agency which might materially impair the
ability of the Issuers to proceed with the Exchange Offer or the
Private Exchange, and no material adverse development shall have
occurred in any existing action or proceeding with respect to the
Issuers and the Guarantors; (iii) all governmental approvals
shall have been obtained, which approvals the Issuers deem
necessary for the consummation of the Exchange Offer or Private
Exchange and (iv) the Holders shall have satisfied customary
conditions relating to the delivery of the Exchange Securities and
the Private Exchange Notes (and related guarantees) and the
execution and delivery of customary documentation relating to the
Exchange Offer or Private Exchanges as applicable.

The Exchange Securities and the
Private Exchange Notes (and related guarantees) shall be issued
under (i) the Indenture or (ii) an indenture
substantially identical in all material respects to the Indenture
and which, in either case, has been qualified under the TIA or is
exempt from such qualification and shall provide that the Exchange
Securities shall not be subject to the transfer restrictions set
forth in the Indenture. The Indenture or such other indenture shall
provide that the Exchange Notes, the Private Exchange Notes and the
Notes shall vote and consent together on all matters as one class
and that none of the Exchange Notes, the Private Exchange Notes or
the Notes will have the right to vote or consent as a separate
class on any matter.

(c) If, (i) because of any
change in law or in currently prevailing interpretations of the
staff of the SEC, the Issuers or the Guarantors are not permitted
to consummate the Exchange Offer within 270 days of the Issue Date,
(ii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated within 270 days of
the Issue Date, (iii) any holder of Private Exchange Notes so
requests in writing to the Issuers at any time within 30 days after
the consummation of the Exchange Offer, (iv) in the case of
any Holder that participates in the Exchange Offer, such Holder
does not receive Exchange Securities on the date of the exchange
that may be sold without restriction under state and federal
securities laws (other than due solely to the status of such Holder
as an affiliate of either Issuer or any Guarantor within the
meaning of the Securities Act) or (v) any Initial Purchaser so
requests with respect to the Securities or the Private Exchange
Notes (and related guarantees) that have the status of unsold
allotments in an initial distribution and so notifies the Issuers
within 30 days after such Initial Purchaser or such Holder, as the
case may be, first becomes aware of such status (but in any event
(x) no earlier than the date upon which the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement is declared effective and (y) no later
than 30 days after the consummation of the Exchange Offer), in the
case of each of clauses (i) through and including (v) of
this sentence, then the Issuers and the Guarantors shall promptly
deliver to the Trustee (to deliver to the Holders) written notice
thereof (the “ Shelf Notice ”) and shall file a
Shelf Registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof.

3. Shelf
Registration

If at any time a Shelf Notice is
delivered as contemplated by Section 2(c) hereof,
then:

(a) Shelf Registration . The
Issuers and the Guarantors shall promptly file with the SEC a
Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous
basis pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of the Registrable
Securities (the “ Initial Shelf Registration ”).
The Issuers and the Guarantors shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC the Initial
Shelf Registration on or prior to the Filing Date. The Initial
Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-1 or another appropriate form
permitting registration of such Registrable Securities for resale
by Holders in the manner or manners designated by them (including,
without limitation, one or more underwritten offerings).

The Issuers and the Guarantors shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Shelf Registration to be declared effective under the Securities
Act on or prior to the Effectiveness Date and to keep the Initial
Shelf Registration continuously effective under the Securities Act
until the earliest of (i) 360 days after the date that the
Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective, (ii) the
date on which all Registrable Securities covered by the Initial
Shelf Registration have been sold in the manner set forth and as
contemplated in the Initial Shelf Registration or, if applicable, a
Subsequent Shelf Registration or (iii) the date on which all
Registrable Securities have been otherwise sold (the “
Effectiveness Period ”); provided ,
however , that the Effectiveness Period in respect of the
Initial Shelf Registration shall be extended to the extent required
to permit dealers to comply with the applicable prospectus delivery
requirements of Rule 174 under the Securities Act and as otherwise
provided herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time, the Issuers may delay the filing of any
Initial Shelf Registration Statement or delay or suspend the
effectiveness thereof, for a reasonable period of time, but not in
excess of 60 consecutive days or more than three (3) times
during any calendar year (each, a “ Shelf Suspension
Period ”), if the Board of Directors of each Issuer or a
similar governing body of any parent company of the either Issuer
(each, a “ Board ”)
 
-9-


determines reasonably and in good faith that the
filing of any such Initial Shelf Registration or the continuing
effectiveness thereof would require the disclosure of non-public
material information that, in the reasonable judgment of such
Board, would be detrimental to either Issuer if so disclosed or
would otherwise materially adversely affect a financing,
acquisition, disposition, merger or other material transaction or
such action is required by applicable law.

(b) Withdrawal of Stop Orders;
Subsequent Shelf Registrations . If the Initial Shelf
Registration or any Subsequent Shelf Registration ceases to be
effective for any reason at any time during the Effectiveness
Period (other than in the case of Shelf Suspension Period(s)
permitted by this Agreement and other than because of the sale of
all of the Securities registered thereunder), the Issuers and the
Guarantors shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness thereof, and in any event shall file an additional
Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of
the Registrable Securities covered by and not sold under the
Initial Shelf Registration or an earlier Subsequent Shelf
Registration (each, a “ Subsequent Shelf Registration
”). If a Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, the Issuers
and the Guarantors shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Subsequent Shelf Registration to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as practicable
after such filing and to keep such subsequent Shelf Registration
continuously effective for a period equal to the number of days in
the Effectiveness Period less the aggregate number of days during
which the Initial Shelf Registration or any Subsequent Shelf
Registration was previously continuously effective. As used herein,
the term “ Shelf Registration ” means the
Initial Shelf Registration and any Subsequent Shelf
Registration.

(c) Supplements and
Amendments . The Issuers and the Guarantors shall promptly
supplement and/or amend the Shelf Registration if required by the
rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration
form used for such Shelf Registration, if required by the
Securities Act, or if reasonably requested by the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable
Securities (or their counsel) covered by such Registration
Statement with respect to the information included therein with
respect to one or more of such Holders, or, if reasonably requested
by any underwriter of such Registrable Securities, with respect to
the information included therein with respect to such
underwriter.

4. Additional
Interest

(a) The Issuers, the Guarantors and
the Initial Purchasers agree that the Holders will suffer damages
if the Issuers and the Guarantors fail to fulfill their obligations
under Section 2 or Section 3 hereof, as further specified
in this Section 4 (each, a “ Registration Default
”), and that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent
of such damages with precision. Accordingly, the Issuers and the
Guarantors agree to pay, jointly and severally, as liquidated
damages, additional interest to the Holders of the Notes affected
thereby (“ Additional Interest ”) if
(A) the Issuers and the Guarantors have neither
(i) exchanged Exchange Securities for all Securities validly
tendered in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer nor
(ii) if applicable, had a Shelf Registration Statement
declared effective, in either case on or prior to the 270th day
after the Issue Date, (B) notwithstanding clause (A), the
Issuers and the Guarantors are required to file a Shelf
Registration Statement and such Shelf Registration Statement is not
declared effective on or prior to the Effectiveness Date or (C), if
applicable, a Shelf Registration Statement has been declared
effective and such Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be
effective at any time during
 
-10-


the Effectiveness Period (other than because of
the sale of all of the Securities registered thereunder). Such
Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding affected thereby (but, following the
consummation of the Exchange Offer, only on the principal amount of
such Notes that could not be exchanged or were not exchanged as
specified in Section 2(c) hereof) at a rate of 0.25% per
annum for the first 90-day period (which rate will be increased by
an additional 0.25% per annum for each subsequent 90-day
period that such Additional Interest continues to accrue,
provided that the rate at which such Additional Interest
accrues may in no event exceed 1.00% per annum) (such
Additional Interest to be calculated by the Issuers) commencing on
the (x) 271st day after the Issue Date in the case of
(A) above, (y) the Effectiveness Date in the case of
(B) above, or (z) the day on which such Shelf
Registration Statement ceases to be effective in the case of
(C) above; provided , however , that upon the
exchange of the Exchange Securities for all Securities validly
tendered (in the case of clause (A)(i) of this Section 4),
upon the effectiveness of the applicable Shelf Registration
Statement (in the case of clause (A)(ii) and clause (B) of
this Section 4(a)), or upon the effectiveness of the
applicable Shelf Registration Statement which had ceased to remain
effective (in the case of clause (C) of this Section 4),
Additional Interest on the Notes in respect of which such events
relate as a result of such clause (or the relevant subclause
thereof), as the case may be, shall cease to accrue.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 4, the
Issuers and the Guarantors shall not be obligated to pay Additional
Interest provided in Section 4(a)(A)(ii) or 4(a)(C) hereof
during a Shelf Suspension Period permitted by Section 3(a)
hereof. The obligation of the Issuers and the Guarantors to pay
Additional Interest as set forth in this Section 4 shall be
the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Holders and
Participating Broker-Dealers for any Registration Default.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the
amount of Additional Interest payable shall not increase because
more than one Registration Default has occurred and is continuing
and (ii) a Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer that is not
entitled to the benefits of the Shelf Registration shall not be
entitled to Additional Interest with respect to any Registration
Default that pertains to the Shelf Registration.

(b) The Issuers shall notify the
Trustee within five Business Days after the occurrence of a
Registration Default in respect of which Additional Interest is
required to be paid. Any amounts of Additional Interest due
pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 4 will be payable
in cash semiannually on each January 31 and July 31 (to
the holders of record on the January 15 and July 15
immediately preceding such dates), in each case commencing with the
first such date occurring after any such Additional Interest
commences to accrue. The amount of Additional Interest will be
determined by the Issuers by multiplying the applicable Additional
Interest rate by the principal amount of the Registrable Securities
affected by the Registration Default, multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest
rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of
a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and, in the case
of a partial month, the actual number of days elapsed), and the
denominator of which is 360.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Additional Interest will be owed in respect of any Existing
Securities.

5. Registration
Procedures

In connection with the filing of any
Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2 or 3 hereof, the
Issuers and the Guarantors shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such registrations to permit the sale
of the securities covered thereby in accordance with the intended
method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto and
in connection with any Registration Statement filed by the Issuers
and the Guarantors hereunder the Issuers and the Guarantors
shall:

(a) Use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC, a
Registration Statement or Registration Statements as prescribed by
Section 2 or 3 hereof, and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each such Registration Statement to
become effective and remain effective as provided herein;
provided , however , that if (1) such filing is
pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (2) a Prospectus
contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed
pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to
sell Exchange Securities during the Applicable Period relating
thereto from whom the Issuers have received prior written notice
that it will be a Participating Broker-Dealer in the Exchange
Offer, before filing any Registration Statement or Prospectus or
any amendments or supplements thereto, the Issuers and the
Guarantors shall furnish to and afford counsel for the Holders of
the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
(with respect to a Registration Statement filed pursuant to
Section 3 hereof), which shall be a single firm and which
shall be Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP or such other firm
selected by the Holders holding a majority in principal amount of
the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
or counsel for such Participating Broker-Dealer (with respect to
any such Registration Statement), as the case may be, and counsel
to the managing underwriters, if any, a reasonable opportunity to
review copies of all such documents (including copies of any
documents to be incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits
thereto) proposed to be filed (in each case at least three Business
Days prior to such filing). The Issuers and the Guarantors shall
not file any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments
or supplements thereto if the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement, or any such Participating Broker-Dealer, as
the case may be, their counsel, or the managing underwriters, if
any, shall reasonably object.

(b) Prepare and file with the SEC
such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Shelf
Registration Statement or Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as
the case may be, as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement continuously effective for the Effectiveness Period, the
Applicable Period or until consummation of the Exchange Offer, as
the case may be; cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by
any Prospectus supplement required by applicable law, and as so
supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; and comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act applicable to
them with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by
such Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as
so supplemented and with respect to the subsequent resale of any
securities being sold by a Participating Broker-Dealer covered by
any such Prospectus in all material respects. The Issuers and the
Guarantors shall be deemed not to have used their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to keep a Registration Statement
effective if they voluntarily take any action that is reasonably
expected to result in selling Holders of the Registrable Securities
covered thereby or Participating Broker-Dealers seeking to sell
Exchange Securities not being able to sell such Registrable
Securities or such Exchange Securities during that period unless
such action is required by applicable law or permitted by this
Agreement.
 
-12-



(c) If (1) a Shelf Registration
is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (2) a Prospectus
contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed
pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to
sell Exchange Securities during the Applicable Period relating
thereto from whom the Issuers have received written notice that it
will be a Participating Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, notify
the selling Holders of Registrable Securities (with respect to a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof), or
each such Participating Broker-Dealer (with respect to any such
Registration Statement), as the case may be, their counsel and the
managing underwriters, if any, promptly (but in any event within
three Business Days), and confirm such notice in writing,
(i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the
same has become effective under the Securities Act (including in
such notice a written statement that any Holder may, upon request,
obtain, at the sole expense of the Issuers, one conformed copy of
such Registration Statement or post-effective amendment including
financial statements and schedules, documents incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by reference and exhibits), (ii) of
the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order
preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or
the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) if
at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities Act to
be delivered in connection with sales of the Registrable Securities
or resales of Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers,
any of the representations and warranties of the Issuers and the
Guarantors contained in any agreement (including any underwriting
agreement) contemplated by Section 5(m) hereof cease to be
true and correct in all material respects, (iv) of the receipt
by the Issuers and the Guarantors of any notification with respect
to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from
qualification of a Registration Statement or any of the Registrable
Securities or the Exchange Securities to be sold by any
Participating Broker-Dealer for offer or sale in any jurisdiction,
or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose, (v) of the happening of any event, the existence of
any condition or any information becoming known that makes any
statement made in such Registration Statement or related Prospectus
or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein
by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the
making of any changes in or amendments or supplements to such
Registration Statement, Prospectus or document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference so that, in the case
of the Registration Statement or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by reference, it will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the
Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference, it will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and (vi) of the Issuers’ determination that
a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be
appropriate.

(d) Use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any
order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or
of any order preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus or
suspending the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of
any of the Registrable Securities or the Exchange Securities to be
sold by any Participating Broker-Dealer, for sale in any
jurisdiction, and, if any such order is issued, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
such order as soon as possible.
 
-13-



(e) If (1) a Shelf Registration
is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (2) a Prospectus
contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed
pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to
sell Exchange Securities during the Applicable Period and if
requested during the Effectiveness Period by the managing
underwriter or underwriters (if any), the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold
in connection with an underwritten offering or any Participating
Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, (i) as promptly as
practicable incorporate in a prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment such information as the managing
underwriter or underwriters (if any), such Holders or any
Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, or counsel for
