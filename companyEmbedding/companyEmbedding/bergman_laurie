Dr. Laurie Bergman grew up in Northern New Jersey and received her undergraduate degree in biology from Columbia University in New York City. She graduated from veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania in 1993.
Dr. Bergman has been a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists since 2003; one of less than 70 people to hold this distinguished title. She worked in small animal practice at Tuft’s University, served as the Behavior Service Coordinator for the University of California Veterinary Medical Center-San Diego, and in 2008 Dr. Bergman returned to Pennsylvania where she has been in private behavior practice.
She has competed in agility with her Australian Terriers and has trained other species, such as birds and cats, none of whom have been as challenging as her two children.
