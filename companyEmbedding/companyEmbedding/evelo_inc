A sporty and powerful electric bike

The Aries combines a unique, supple, full-suspension frame designed to take on any road or trail, with wider tires to help absorb any bumps along the way. The available SuperCharged 500W motor makes climbing hills a breeze, while the balanced weight distribution afforded by our patented mid-drive motor results in more responsive handling.

Your EVELO Electric Bicycle comes with a high-quality saddle. However, our customers are all unique and so are their needs and preferences.

I absolutely love my new Aries bike! I have been riding over 22 miles per day. I'm now able to travel further and climb greater inclines that before would've been a lot more challenging or down right inaccessible. I look forward to many more years of enjoyment on my EVELO bicycle.

Shifting Gears Is As Easy As Turning A Dial
NuVinci® makes manual shifting a thing of the past with its continuous variable transmission. Watch the display simulate the terrain you are on as you turn a dial to smoothly shift gears. It is intuitive with no learning curve. Best of all, NuVinci® systems require no regular maintenance.











The Power to Conquer Any Hill
Our powerful mid-drive motor means that hills are no longer an obstacle when you ride. Locating the motor in the middle of the frame, closer to the bike’s center of gravity, ensures improved handling and safer riding. All EVELOs are equipped with both pedal-assist and throttle functionality. You can pedal as little or as much as you want, while the throttle lets you take a break from pedaling or can give you an extra boost up hills. Either way − pedal-assist or throttle −  you are always in control.











Go The Extra Mile
If you plan to take your electric bike on a longer trip than usual, we have you covered. Our standard batteries have a range of up to 40 miles. The optional extended-range batteries, available on some models, increase that range to up to 60 miles per charge. All of our bikes have high-quality batteries from manufacturers such as Panasonic, Samsung, and Lenovo. Ride and explore, while spending less time wondering if you have enough power to get back home!

What Customers Say About Us














I have put over 200 miles on my EVELO in the past few weeks. Nothing but fun. And more fun! After 25 miles on pedal assist I still have over half a battery charge left. Hills become flat. I have been riding on pavement, dirt roads, and trails in the forest. Riding a regular bike is quite a bit of work in hilly areas like where I live. My EVELO makes riding fun.

We were a bit apprehensive, buying a bike we had not seen in person much less ridden, but am so glad we went with a leap of faith. These bikes are extremely sturdy, well built and incredibly FUN! There isn't a hill we haven't conquered with the power assist at our fingertips. We glide over every terrain we come across with ease. They have plenty of power and are super comfortable.




Don & Lorri
Hawaii















The entire EVELO experience in the purchasing of two bikes (two and a half years apart) has been excellent from every angle, and we have never had to wait more than half an hour, even on weekends, for help with a question. My husband just bought his' and is as thrilled as I was from his first ride!

Four major surgeries and seven procedures have made it virtually impossible for me to use a regular bike, but Minnesota has great bike trails – and the EVELO is the perfect answer to my problem. It helps me cope with the wind and the cold, taking the stress off these older bones, and keeping me up and moving.




Kirk
Minnesota















I live in a rural, very hilly part of Wisconsin and bike commute 20+ miles every day. For 12 years, I’ve ridden a road bike. I still love the challenge, but I know there are days (at age 54) when I need to dial it back. The EVELO makes it wonderfully possible to find a good balance with recovery.

What Customers Say About Us














I have put over 200 miles on my EVELO in the past few weeks. Nothing but fun. And more fun! After 25 miles on pedal assist I still have over half a battery charge left. Hills become flat. I have been riding on pavement, dirt roads, and trails in the forest. Riding a regular bike is quite a bit of work in hilly areas like where I live. My EVELO makes riding fun. 




Bill Gray
Arizona















EVELO Electric Bikes are really superb! The customer service is the best we've ever experienced for an online product purchase. 

We feel very confident in our purchases and know we will be taken care of it we have any issues.

MotionDrive™ System

									Our innovative MotionDrive™ System brings together premium drivetrain and battery components to make your riding experience simple, fun and worry-free.								






Powerful Motor

									Our powerful mid-drive motor will help you conquer virtually any hill. We’ve located the motor in the middle of the frame, close to the center of gravity, improving stability and handling. With both pedal-assist and full throttle at your fingertips, you are in complete control.								






Easy Gear Shifting

									NuVinci® makes manual shifting a thing of the past with its continuous variable transmission. Watch the display simulate the terrain you are on as you turn a dial to smoothly shift gears. It is intuitive with no learning curve. 
								






Long Lasting Battery

									If you plan to take your electric bike on a longer trip than usual, we have you covered. Our standard batteries have a range of up to 40 miles. The optional extended-range batteries, available on some models, increase that range to up to 60 miles								

















Try EVELO at Home
Buying an electric bike online is a big decision. We understand that, and so every EVELO comes with a 10-day trial period. Take it for a ride around the block or up that hill and if you don’t absolutely love it, we’ll take it back or exchange it for another. We’ll even cover the return shipping costs, and there are no hidden fees.

Life Changing:Monoclonal Microbials










The Science
 







The Science
 



Evelo's vision is to improve the lives of patients with serious diseases through the development of a broadly applicable new modality of medicines – monoclonal microbials






Monoclonal Microbials
 







Monoclonal Microbials
 



 Monoclonal microbials act through the gut to modulate biology that impacts many diseasesHumans have evolved over millennia with the microbes in and on our bodies. These microbes play a vital role in developing and directing immune and biological responses.Evelo is harnessing the therapeutic potential of specific strains of naturally occurring microbes and developing them as a new class of medicines, monoclonal microbials.We have validated that orally delivered monoclonal microbials modulate immunological and biological effects throughout the body after initial interactions with human cells in the gut.Evelo is pioneering the development of this new class of medicine for the treatment of autoimmune, immunoinflammatory, metabolic, neurological, neuroinflammatory diseases and cancer. Oncology Colon Cancer, Lung Cancer, Melanoma, Renal Cancer, Bladder Cancer
Immuno-Inflammatory Disease Psoriasis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Atopic Dermatitis, Food Allergy, Type I Diabetes
Neuro-Inflammation/Degeneration Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease







Neuro-CNS Autism, Anxiety, Depression
Metabolism Malnutrition, Type II Diabetes, Obesity, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Heart Disease
Vaccines Oral vaccines for autoimmune disease, infectious disease, and cancer; conditioning responses to current vaccines 










Our Approach
 







Our Approach
 



Our platform integrates expertise in microbiology, immunology, pharmacology and computational biology.We find and select naturally occurring monoclonal microbials for therapeutic use.Our monoclonal microbials are developed with expertise in experimental medicine, formulation, delivery, process development and manufacturing.






Immune System
 







Immune System
 



 Monoclonal microbials and the immune systemWe have discovered and are developing specific monoclonal microbials that modulate systemic biology.These single strains impact multiple immunomodulatory pathways:Mechanisms clinically relevant to treating cancerActivation of dendritic cell subtypes, activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages and infiltration of T cells to the tumor microenvironmentMechanisms clinically relevant to treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseasesInduction of regulatory T cell activity, inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and induction of regulatory dendritic cells 










Pipeline
 







Pipeline
 



PipelineWe are advancing multiple monoclonal microbials with differentiated immunomodulatory activities through pre-clinical development and will start several clinical studies across oncology and immunoinflammatory diseases in 2018.










What Matters
 







What Matters
 



Every life matters and we are driven by the mission to provide broad access to important new medicines.






Current Healthcare
 







Current Healthcare
 



 Current healthcare doesn’t work for everyoneBiotech has helped many people through great science innovation in areas including monoclonal antibodies and targeted anti viral and oncology therapies.Despite great success in treating many diseases, current healthcare is limited.Currently, we treat late stages of diseases in a small portion of the world’s population with high cost drugs that have many side effects.We are committed to dramatically improving healthcareMonoclonal microbials have the potential to fundamentally change traditional models of drug discovery and development.By finding and selecting naturally occurring monoclonal microbials with defined therapeutic effects, we can improve the speed, cost and probability of drug discovery and development.Evelo’s platform enables pharmacological intervention at all stages of disease with naturally occurring, safe and effective monoclonal microbials. 










Our Team
 







Our Team

A stylish & comfortable electric cruiser

Luna is our take on the classic cruiser bike, and we’ve designed it to be perfect for more than just the beachfront boardwalk. The deep step-through frame provides super-easy on-and-off access, while the swept-back handlebars keep the rider in an upright sitting position. Its well-designed seat combines support with maximum comfort. No wonder it is popular with both men and women. With exceptional cargo capacity, an optional 500W motor, and available NuVinci® fully automatic transmission, Luna can take you just about anywhere!

Perfect Seat Guarantee
Your EVELO Electric Bicycle comes with a high-quality saddle. However, our customers are all unique and so are their needs and preferences. As such, we offer the industry’s first “Perfect Seat” Guarantee. If you find another seat that you prefer at a local shop, purchase it, and we will reimburse you up to $40! This is just one of the ways we strive to ensure that you are 100% comfortable and satisfied with your bike.


























We researched e-bikes quite a bit before choosing EVELO. The customer service was excellent and they helped us on a few minor questions regarding assembly right away. After riding the bikes in hilly Colorado for a few weeks, we are absolutely thrilled with our EVELOs. We can pedal for exercise or have pedal assist uphill, and the NuVinci system is incredibly smooth. Bravo!




Jeanne
Colorado















We were a bit apprehensive, buying a bike we had not seen in person much less ridden, but am so glad we went with a leap of faith. These bikes are extremely sturdy, well built and incredibly FUN! There isn't a hill we haven't conquered with the power assist at our fingertips. We glide over every terrain we come across with ease. They have plenty of power and are super comfortable.

Shifting Gears Is As Easy As Turning A Dial
NuVinci® makes manual shifting a thing of the past with its continuous variable transmission. Watch the display simulate the terrain you are on as you turn a dial to smoothly shift gears. It is intuitive with no learning curve. The option of the fully automatic Harmony™ version completely removes the need to shift gears. Best of all, NuVinci® systems require no regular maintenance.











The Power to Conquer Any Hill
Our powerful mid-drive motor means that hills are no longer an obstacle when you ride. Locating the motor in the middle of the frame, closer to the bike’s center of gravity, ensures improved handling and safer riding. All EVELOs are equipped with both pedal-assist and throttle functionality. You can pedal as little or as much as you want, while the throttle lets you take a break from pedaling or can give you an extra boost up hills. Either way − pedal-assist or throttle −  you are always in control.











Go The Extra Mile
If you plan to take your electric bike on a longer trip than usual, we have you covered. Our high-quality batteries have a range of up to 40 miles per charge and are manufactured by Lenovo. Ride and explore, while spending less time wondering if you have enough power to get back home!

Why I Like EVELO



Having invested in dozens of companies, what attracted us to EVELO was a combination of 3 things. First, the experienced team that has worked together for years prior and has the know-how to take the business from a startup phase to a fast-growing, profitable organization. Second, traction - with over $6M in sales to date, they're proving market validation. And third, the product itself – we believe that EVELO has developed a line of very innovative products that seem to be resonating with consumers.

THE BUZZ ABOUT EVELO




Boris Mordkovich, a 30-year-old serial entrepreneur, had never considered developing products for the aging baby boomer market. One day, however, he saw that his parents had started using an electric bike that his brother Yevgeniy had modified for his wife and himself. The company is just one of many that are plugging into a wealthy slice of the over-50 demographic called the longevity market, whose annual economic activity currently amounts to $7.6 trillion, according to AARP.

The Omni Wheel By Evelo Turns Any Bicycle Into An E-bike 
August 22, 2016
Electric bicycles are seeing a steady increase in popularity as manufacturers spring up to create a product, while existing companies add these powered two-wheelers to their traditional lineup. There are many approaches to creating e-bikes, but they can be broken down into two groups -- bespoke vehicles that were built from scratch, and machines designed to add power to an otherwise ordinary bike.

We've Perfected the Electric Bike
Our advantage? A 60 mile range, automatic gear shifting, and ultra-powerful mid-drive motor design


        EVELO electric bikes were designed  to replace cars for short-distance commuting and enhance biking for recreation, while our exclusive Omni Wheel turns any bike into an electric bike in less than 30 minutes. 
  


 










ARIES

              Conquer your ride with the high-performance, powerful Aries.          



AURORA

              Front suspension hybrid commuter perfect for any occasion.          



LUNA

Easy-going cruiser with step-through frame for style & comfort.            



ORION

The perfect city bike – for getting to work or around town.              







The Omni Wheel Makes Any Bike Electric
Allows us to tackle the existing market

The Omni Wheel is designed to fit practically any bicycle or lifestyle. Whether you have a cruiser, an urban city bike, a recumbent, or anything in-between, once you install the Omni Wheel, your bike becomes an electric hybrid.           
How it Works

Omni Wheel complements your own pedal power. With a throttle providing power on demand, you can pedal as much or as little as you want – while always having the power from the wheel available at the push of a button.          












The E-Bike Industry is Rapidly Expanding
Electric bikes help people to overcome barriers like hills, distance, and fitness levels and enjoy cycling for both recreation and for their commute.

      The electric bike has made biking more accessible than ever to a whole generation of older riders and long-distance commuters. This industry is just beginning.

Europe is already on board. The US market is about to take off
We're reaching a new market of commuters and bike enthusiasts here in the US and abroad. EVELO is riding the wave of an entirely new industry.




"I would guess 90 to 95 percent of people in the U.S. don’t even know what an electric bicycle is.”- Ryan Citron, Navigant Analyst




"It’s a category that is wide open. Little guys are jumping into a business that no one's been paying attention to." - Edward Benjamin, Senior Managing Director of ECycleElectric Consultants


 



"The U.S. market could develop “way faster” than Europe’s did."- Claus Fleischer, Head of Bosch’s E-bike Division




"Electrics “finally have legs to be able to take off in the U.S.,” because cyclists are feeling safer on the roads, battery and motor technology is improving, and retail prices are dropping. - Todd Grant, President of the National Bike Dealers Association

Disrupting the Bike Industry Via Direct-to-Consumer Distribution
We ship directly to the consumer, eliminating distribution costs and inflated markups.

The bicycle industry’s distribution model is antiquated. For every bike sold, wholesalers and dealers may add hundreds of dollars (40-60%) to the end price tag the consumer pays.
EVELO cuts out the middleman by delivering the bike directly to your door. With test rides provided through our Ambassador Program, we provide quality customer support with hassle-free delivery.
  


SALES AMBASSADORS

     Pairs potential buyers with existing customers for test rides and feature explanations, just like bike shops provide.
  



PRE-ASSEMBLED

             Arrives at your doorstep 95% assembled. The finishing touches will take no more than 30 minutes.
        



FREE RETURNS

The industry’s first 10-Day At-Home Trial policy. Try it at home for 10 days for a risk-free experience.
          



SERVICES & REPAIRS

We contact a partner bike shop near your home. Just drop off the bike at the shop, we take it from there.         



Our Network of Ambassadors Covers the Nation
Our Ambassador Program replaces dealers by connecting existing EVELO owners with potential customers for test-rides. Our Ambassadors (existing owners) make money every time they do a test-ride and every time that test ride turns into a sale. As such, we are the only company of its kind where our customers can actually earn an income off their bike.

Here's How Your Investment Will Help Us
We're Focusing on Bringing New Products to Market & Going Global



More Products to Market

Our objective for the next three years is to introduce at least two new products per year to expand our product line. Our next product launch is scheduled for early 2017.            



International Expansion

The next phase of our growth includes expanding first into Canada, and then into Europe. Kickstarting our move into the international cycling market requires an injection of capital.

            



Customer Acquisition

A typical customer's acquisition cost is about ~9% of our revenue. The goal is to increase volume with our suppliers and thereby lower production costs to help reduce this percentage.

            



Recurring Revenue

We want to explore a bike-as-a-service, subscription-based model, where customers can pay a monthly fee for access to an EVELO bike, repairs, and theft protection.
            




Let's Change How We Move Around!


Dear Reader,
EVELO is growing fast! With over $3M in projected revenue this year and thousands of satisfied customers all over the United States, we've grown more than 60% this year alone. We have a strong, dedicated team in place and an amazing community of customers and Ambassadors all around the country.
      
We're proud that we reached this point on a fairly bootstrapped budget. My brother (and co-founder) and I started EVELO 4 years ago with just our personal savings. It's grown into a multi-million dollar, profitable company by focusing on the customer, developing beautiful, comfortable electric bikes, and creating an innovative distribution model. Our customers can customize their perfect bike in minutes and have it delivered 95% assembled directly to their door.
      
However, this is only the beginning. 
      

Our goal for EVELO has always been to make biking more accessible to everyone, by removing the common barriers that keep people from cycling. Whether those barriers are hills, fitness levels, age or even the simple inconvenience of arriving to a destination sweaty, EVELO bikes makes anything possible.
      
Moreover, we want to change the way that the traditional bicycle industry does business. By removing layers of distributors, sales reps, and brick-and-mortar dealers, our idea has always been to provide our customers with more value for every dollar they spend on the bike.
      
There is even more work to be done. We truly believe that electric bikes are the future of personal transportation and want to make them mainstream in North America. We are looking to release several new models next year, begin international expansion (starting with Canada), and introduce new ways to make owning an e-bike even more affordable.
      
To accomplish these goals faster and make EVELO a household brand, we are collaborating with a small group of investors that believe in the potential of electric bikes and want to be a part of this growing movement.
      
Now we're opening up investment in EVELO to all of those who share these goals. In the past, only wealthy investors and venture capitalists had the opportunity to buy stock in private companies like Google and Facebook before they went public. That just changed. The recent passage of the JOBS Act allows anyone to invest in private companies. 
      
As such, we invite you to take a look at our fundraising campaign.
      

           Sincerely,

                  Can you take us back to the beginning? How did you get started?
                  



The idea actually resulted from a problem I saw in my own family. My brother and his wife ride bikes together, but it was difficult for her to keep up on the hills and to travel as far and as fast as my brother. My brother built an electric-assisted bike for her, which solved the problem and their rides together became more frequent and enjoyable for them both. Talking about this one day, we realized that a lot of other people would benefit from the same technology. So we researched the issue and started the company with about $100,000 of our own money.

Prior to founding EVELO, my brother and I started, grew, and eventually sold two other companies during the last decade. From our initial investment we’ve grown EVELO organically, relying only on our own revenue and profits for the first 3-1/2 years. The result is sales of about $6 million, with $1 million in sales in just the last quarter alone.




                  Who is your competition?
                  



We have two different types of competitors:

 1. Traditional Bike Companies (e.g., Trek, Specialized, Schwinn)

The one thing that makes traditional bike companies so strong is the same thing that makes their electric bike offerings and distribution so weak -- their dealers are true cycling enthusiasts who frequently started their bike shop because of that passion. The vast majority of traditional bike shops today, however, tend to think of electric bikes as a form of "cheating".This trickles down the entire supply chain. A bike company may have only 1 or 2 electric bike models, resulting in limited choice. Bike shop owners and staff are not thrilled about selling electric-powered products. Customers typically start their e-bike research online, rather than by going to a local store.Given all of this, if you visit any traditional bike store and ask them about their electric bike distribution, they will either have no interest or they will say that they tried but couldn’t really find a way to sell a meaningful number of e-bikes.Even with traditional bike companies not finding a viable market for electric bikes, we still take steps to differentiate ourselves.

- Laser focus on electric bikes and direct-to-consumer distribution.- We only sell electric bikes, making us the natural choice for customers looking for one. Based on our findings, many people begin their research on electric bikes online rather than by going to a traditional store. This allows us to capture their attention and trust first.- In terms of distribution, traditional bike brands are inflexible, given that they have to rely on an existing network of dealers. As a result, any bike sold directly at a brick-and-mortar dealer carries a markup of up to 40% over a direct-to-consumer brand like ours. This allows us to offer a lower price to the customer while maintaining a higher profit margin.

2. Electric Bike Companies (e.g., Pedego, Stromer, Faraday)

With competing electric bike companies, we focus on the ways we can win over a customer.

1.  Technology - although there is no such thing as a perfect bike for everyone, certain technological features do make a bike more appealing to a wider population.

- Automatic Transmission -- Many of our customers are new to cycling, so we focus on making our products incredibly easy to use with no learning curve. For example, many customers tell us that they dislike the traditional gearing mechanisms used on bikes. Consequently, we have done away with traditional gearing by using the NuVinci Harmony CVT instead. This is basically an automatic transmission like we find in cars, but designed for a bike, changing the gears for the rider automatically (http://www.evelo.com/evelo-difference/nuvinci-harmony-automatic-transmission/).

- Mid-Drive Motor Design -- We also chose a different motor design than most other e-bike companies. They use traditional hub motors because they are cheaper and easier to source. Instead, we offer a mid-drive option. This offers a lot of advantages: better climbing of the hills, better range, ability to use a smaller battery and still get great range, and being able to take advantage of all of the gears on a bike (http://www.evelo.com/evelo-difference/advantages-mid-drive-motor-vs-hub-motor/). The use of a mid-drive motor, combined with the NuVinci Harmony, is a major draw for many of our customers.

- Omni Wheel -- In addition to a line of complete electric bikes, we recently launched the new Omni Wheel (http://omni.evelo.com). By replacing the front wheel with the Omni, anyone can convert a traditional bike into an electric one in just 20 minutes. No technical skills are required, and it comes at a fraction of the price of a complete bike. With the addition of the Omni Wheel, we can meet the needs of virtually any customer at any price point.

2. Distribution -- Technology is only 50% of the equation. Even if we had the best bike tech out there, if we can't sell it at the right price point to the right customer, we would still be out of luck.

- Direct-to-Consumer Distribution Model – selling directly to customers in an online marketplace lets us consistently price our products at 25%+ less than brands at brick-and-mortar stores, while also offering a better overall product (more power, more range). This allows us to scale faster and more efficiently such that with modest increases in team size, we grow significantly due to the structure of our work.

- Ambassador Program – We counteract one big advantage that dealers at bike stores have with this program. It connects existing EVELO owners with potential customers for test rides. Our Ambassadors (existing owners) make money every time they complete the test ride process, as well as every time a test ride turns into a sale. We are the only company in the industry where our customers can actually earn an income off their bike purchase -- to the tune of $400 to $600 per year on average.

- Subscription Model – We are currently exploring a subscription-based offering that would also enable our customers to get a perfect electric bike for themselves for as low as $99 per month (about the price of a monthly transit pass) without sacrificing the quality or specs of the product.




                  How do you acquire customers?
                  



We’ve worked hard to develop a core strength in digital marketing. Our team of 14 people is split fairly evenly between those from the traditional bike industry and those from the e-commerce space. Most of our marketing is oriented around search, search engine optimization, email marketing, content marketing, and social media. We provide as much information on and through our website as we possibly can to both prospects and existing customers. Our Ambassador program is the only major offline component of our customer acquisition approach. The end result of all this is a typical acquisition cost of 9% (or $300) on an average purchase of $2,800.




                  Could you tell us about your production process?
                  



We currently work with two factories – one in China and the other in Taiwan -- each focused on different product lines. We’ve built excellent relationships with them and team members periodically visit to provide in-person contact. The completed bikes are shipped to our warehouse/office in Seattle by container ship. Orders are customized and shipped directly from our Seattle warehouse and office via either UPS or FedEx to customers.

Our partners are a key piece in our continuing growth. In a capital-intensive business such as EVELO’s, with a goal of achieving economies of scale to slingshot even greater opportunities, we need additional capital. Over the past couple of years, we have fine-tuned our advertising efforts, our logistics, purchasing, etc. -- learning what works, what doesn't, and how to keep costs down. Fast growth at this point depends on focusing on customer acquisition to increase our volume with our suppliers, which will actually drive down production costs. It's win-win situation -- more customers mean we can produce our product for less and we can sell it for less, which in turn will attract more customers. Once we go from $3 million to about $10 million in sales, we’ll start seeing significant drops in our production costs.




                  For those that are completely unfamiliar with your space, can you talk about what the market looks like, and where you see it going in the next 5 years?
                  



One of the things we joke about internally is that an electric bike is the best-selling electric vehicle in the world that nobody in the U.S. knows about. Although the global electric bike market involves $50 billion a year, with 40 million electric bikes sold last year, and a growth rate of 20% year-over-year, the market in the U.S. lags behind the rest of the world. Some companies that started out 3-4 years before we did now reach sales of $40 to $50 million per year.

Some impressive growth in the U.S. market during the past year or so, however, makes this the perfect time for us to expand. In the U.S., interest in electric bikes is fuelled by three major trends. The first is the search for alternative means of transport in growing urban centers, where car ownership is expensive, parking space limited, and rush-hour traffic leads to gridlock. Second, electric transport in general is becoming mainstream for environmental and other reasons. Tesla’s entry into the electric vehicle field succeeded in bringing together technology that is acceptably priced, of proven quality, and visually attractive – paving the way for increased general interest in alternative transport as a whole. The third trend is a growing emphasis on staying health, fit, and active. With a large number of baby boomers now hitting retirement age, staying active and fit may involve age-related challenges that electric bikes help overcome.

Over the next five years, even as electric and hybrid cars become more the norm, some people will still choose an electric bike for most travel, especially as urban areas continue to develop more of a biking culture with increased use of dedicated bike lanes and trails. Zipping past rush-hour traffic will still be appealing whether the cars in traffic are gas powered or electric. And, of course, an electric bike still will help older riders keep fit and active, something that is beyond the capabilities of an electric car. Lifestyle choices offered by electric bikes, such as leisurely rides on trails and paths, a secondary transportation device for RV owners, and quick-and-easy errand-running, will greatly expand.

In essence, the presence of electric and hybrid cars in the market will be a catalyst for growing interest in other environment-friendly options, like electric bikes. We see nothing but growth here in the U.S., as well as some interesting opportunities in other areas of the world.




                  What’s next for your business and why are you raising money now?
                  



Up until now, we've been bootstrapping, with a goal of getting the fundamentals right. We have succeeded in developing a direct-to-consumer model in an industry that traditionally does not take that approach. We have worked on bringing down our acquisition costs, our R&D costs, and fine-tuned the e-commerce side of things. Although there is always more to learn, we're on the right track.

The next step is ramping up growth, first by bringing new products to the market. To that end, we are involved in the internal development of a new product that will be for sale early in 2017.

We also plan to introduce new and recurring revenue streams, starting with the bike-as-a-service approach that I mentioned earlier. Options like theft protection or annual maintenance plans are a real opportunity to turn a $2,800 one-time bike purchase into a monthly subscription to additional service offerings. At the same time, we intend to venture outside of the U.S. market, beginning with expansion into Canada next year. With a similar market and geography, expansion into Canada carries limited risk and lets us fine-tune our distribution techniques. By applying these same techniques to the much larger European market, we will find a profitable niche there that features competitive pricing at 500-1,000 Euros less than European pricing.




                  What’s been your largest challenge so far?
                  



Ironically enough, our biggest challenge came from our major strength -- offering a direct-to-consumer model. Most of the packaging used in the bike industry isn’t designed to effectively protect the product when individual boxes are shipped to customers via cost-effective shippers like FedEx or UPS. At first, we experienced significant damage on up to 25% of shipped bikes resulting from transit through various hubs or centers on its way to its destination, as well as sometimes less-than-stellar treatment during the final trip to the customer’s door. Obviously, this is a poor customer experience and is very costly to deal with, even in cases where our damage claims were accepted by the shipper. We needed another solution. So we experimented with designing packaging that would survive and protect the bike no matter what UPS or FedEx could throw at it. With that challenge solved, shipping damage affects less than half a percent of orders (fewer than 1 in 200 bikes).




                  This is an unusual fundraising strategy. Why have you given your customers the chance to invest online via Wefunder?
                  



We did a small friends and family/seed round last year and also emailed our customer base about our vision for the company. We were blown away by the degree of interest – in fact, two customers wound up investing around $250,000.

But last year we had to turn away many potential investors because they were not accredited investors. With the growth in our customer base and contacts this year, we hope to gain real traction now that the barrier of accreditation has been removed. Having more of our customers have the opportunity to invest in EVELO and expand our relationship with them is an important part of our vision of the company vis-à-vis our customers.




                  Can you tell us about the team? Why are you the ones to make this happen?
                  



My brother and I have been involved in start-ups for the last 10 years or so. Prior to launching EVELO, I was employee number 3 in one of the first person-to-person car sharing dotcoms, which was sort of a hybrid of AirBNB and ZipCar. My main focus there was marketing and customer acquisition. That company went on to raise over $90 million from DC, including Google Ventures, and then expanded nationwide. It was an invaluable learning experience on how to scale a company within a new industry.

About half of our team has extensive experience with traditional bike companies, including a former executive from a large bike brand and another who has worked with one of the largest electrical bike retail operations in North America. Our sales and service teams are comprised of individuals who have previous experience selling and servicing bikes, and all have the knowledge and interest in the industry that is vital to our ongoing success.

But one thing that makes our team really special is that it's the perfect hybrid of those with experience in the traditional bicycle industry and those with e-commerce skills and experience. Our marketing and logistics teams have much experience in online ecommerce in general, covering everything from search engine optimization and online advertising, through online marketing and social media, as well as the logistics needed to make this kind of business a success. This combination of skills in those involved at EVELO creates a powerful synergy that has – and will continue -- to fuel our growth in the coming years.

But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
