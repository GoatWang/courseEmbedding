SCHEDULE 4.14 



Environmental Matters 

1. In connection with closure of certain manufacturing facilities under its restructuring 
program in 2004 the Borrower conducted environmental site assessments which indicated 
potential contamination at the Wake Forest, NC and Farmville, VA sites. The Borrower 
has sold the Wake Forest, NC facility and completed the remediation of that site based 
upon the requirements of the applicable North Carolina regulatory authority. The 
Borrower is attempting to sell the Farmville, VA site and believes that it has substantially 
completed the remediation of this site and does not expect that any future costs related to 
the environmental remediation of this site would be material. 


2. The Borrower received a letter from the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
dated May 4, 2004 and addressed to Weavexx, a brand used by the Borrower and part of 
the name of one of the Borrower’s subsidiaries. The letter seeks information about 
business transactions between Huyck Felt Co. and Safety Light Corporation (including 
Safety Light Corporation’s predecessors and affiliates), and the disposal of hazardous 
substances and/or radioactive wastes at Safety Light Corporation’s site in Bloomsburg, 
Pennsylvania between 1945 and the present. The Borrower’s response to the EPA was 
dated July 30, 2004 and explained that the Borrower has no information about a 
relationship with Safety Light Corporation or any related hazardous substances. 


3. The Borrower has never used asbestos in its manufacturing process. However, in the past 
other manufacturers of clothing did sometimes use asbestos and, as a result, have been 
named as defendants in lawsuits in the United States brought by individuals alleging 
injuries caused by such use of asbestos. While the Borrower has also been named as a 
defendant in a number of cases, it has been able to show that it did not use asbestos and, 
as a result, has typically been successful in getting dismissed from such lawsuits. 
Accordingly, the Borrower does not anticipate incurring any material liabilities for 
asbestos-related claims. 

4. The U.S. federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability 
Act, as amended (“CERCLA”) provides for response to, and, in some instances, joint and 
several liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. The Borrower 
has been identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or similar state 
requirements for the following two off-site locations to date: the Avanti Corporation Site, 
Indianapolis, IN; Maxey Flats Nuclear Disposal Site, Hillsboro, KY. The Borrower has 
also disclosed that it has received a 104(e) information request concerning the Safety 
Light Corporation site in Pennsylvania.

 P. 0. Box - 1 U.S. 1 North Wake Forest, North Carolina 27587
 � SIXTH: The
corporation is to have perpetual existence.  � SEVENTH:
For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the corporation and of its directors and stockholders, it is further provided:
 � 1. The number of directors of the corporation shall be as
specified in the By-Laws of the corporation but such number may from time to time be increased or decreased in such manner as may be prescribed by the By-Laws. In no event shall the number of directors be less than one. The election of directors
need not be by ballot. Directors need not be stockholders.  �


2. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the
Board of Directors is expressly authorized and empowered:  � (a)
To make, alter, amend, and repeal By-Laws, subject to the power of the stockholders to alter or repeal the By-Laws made by the Board of Directors.  � (b) Subject to the applicable provisions of the By-Laws then in effect, to determine, from time to time, whether and to what extent and at what times and
places and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books of the corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of the stockholders, and no stockholder shall have any right to inspect any account or book or document of
the corporation, except as conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, unless and until authorized so to do by resolution of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders of the corporation.  � (c) Without the assent or vote of the stockholders, to authorize and issue
obligations of the corporation, secured or unsecured, to include therein such provisions as to redeemability, convertibility or otherwise, as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may determine, and to authorize the mortgaging or pledging,
as security therefor, of any property of the corporation, real or personal, including after-acquired property.  � (d) To determine whether any, and, if any, what part of the net profits of the corporation or of its net assets in excess of its capital shall be declared
in dividends and paid to the stockholders, and to direct and determine the use and disposition of any such net profits or such net assets in excess of capital.  �
(e) To fix from time to time the amount of profits of the corporation to be reserved as working capital or for any other lawful purpose.  � (f) To establish bonus, profit-sharing or other types of incentive or
compensation plans for the employees (including officers and directors) of the corporation and to fix the amount of profits to be distributed or shared and to determine the persons to participate in any such plans and the amounts of their respective
participations.  � (g) By resolution passed by a majority of the
whole Board to designate one or more committees to consist of two or more directors of the corporation which, to the extent provided in the resolution or in the By-Laws of the corporation, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be fixed to all papers which may require it. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be stated in
the By-Laws of the corporation or as determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.  �
-2- 


In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon it, the
Board of Directors may exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware, of the Certificate of Incorporation and of
the By-Laws of the corporation.  � 3. No contract or other
transaction between the corporation and any other corporation and no other act of the corporation shall, in the absence of fraud in any way be affected or invalidated by the fact that any of the directors of the corporation are pecuniarily or
otherwise interested in, or are directors or officers of, such other corporation. Any director of the corporation individually or any firm or association of which any director may be a member, may be a party to, or may be pecuniarily or otherwise
interested in, any contract or transaction of the corporation, provided that the fact that he individually or such firm or association is so interested shall be disclosed or shall have been known to the Board of Directors or a majority of such
members thereof as shall be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors at which action upon any such contract or transaction shall be taken. Any director of the corporation who is also a director or officer of such other corporation or who is
so interested may be counted in determining the existence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board of Directors which shall authorize any such contract or transaction, and may vote thereat to authorize any such contract or transaction, with like
force and effect as if he were not such director or officer of such other corporation or not so interested. Any director of the corporation may vote upon any contract or other transaction between the corporation and any subsidiary or affiliated
corporation without regard to the fact that he is also a director of such subsidiary or affiliated corporation.  � Any contract, transaction or act of the corporation or of the directors, which shall be ratified by a majority of a quorum of the
stockholders of the corporation at any annual meeting, or at any special meeting called for such purpose, shall, insofar as permitted by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation, be as valid and as binding as though ratified by
every stockholder of the corporation; provided, however, that any failure of the stockholders to approve or ratify any such contract, transaction or act, when and if submitted, shall not be deemed in any way to invalidate the same or deprive the
corporation, its directors, officers or employees, of its or their right to proceed with such contract, transaction or act.  � 4. Subject to any limitation in the By-Laws, the members of the Board of Directors shall be entitled to reasonable fees, salaries or other compensation
for their services and to reimbursement for their expenses as such members. Nothing contained herein shall preclude any director from serving the corporation, or any subsidiary or affiliated corporation, in any other capacity and receiving proper
compensation therefor.  �
-3- 


5. If the By-Laws so provide, the stockholders and Hoard of Directors of the corporation shall have power
to hold their meetings, to have an office or offices and to keep the books of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the laws of Delaware, outside of said State at such place or places as may from time to time be designated by them.
 � EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is
proposed between this corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWXRM » Topics » 1. Company HistoryThis excerpt taken from the XRM 10-Q filed May 7, 2009.1. Company History  Xerium
Technologies, Inc. (the Company) is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of two types of consumable products used primarily in the production of paper  clothing and roll covers. Operations are strategically located in the
major paper-making regions of the world, including North America, Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific.  This excerpt taken from the XRM 10-K filed Mar 12, 2009.1. Company History  Xerium Technologies, Inc. (the
Company), is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of two types of consumable products used primarily in the production of paper  clothing and roll covers. Operations are strategically located in the major paper-making regions
of the world, including North America, Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific. The Company was reorganized in connection with its initial public offering, which was completed on May 19, 2005.  (a) Going Concern as of December 31, 2007  The
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007 were prepared assuming that the Company would continue as a going concern, which was contingent upon, among other things, the Companys ability to comply with all debt covenants
under its then existing senior credit facility. As the Company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants for the period ended March 31, 2008, the balance sheets as of March 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 included a
reclassification of $658,815 and $641,179, respectively, to reflect as current the long-term debt under the senior credit facility. Additionally, because this debt was potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate
swaps, hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No. 133) was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps and the mark to market changes in
their fair value was recorded as non-cash charges to interest expense through June 30, 2008. These mark to market changes resulted in a credit to interest expense of $1,687 for the six month period ended June 30, 2008. See Note 8 for
further discussion of derivatives and hedging.  On April 8, 2008, the Company entered into an amendment and waiver agreement with its
lenders relating to its senior credit facility pursuant to which the lenders agreed to waive through May 31, 2008 (the forbearance period) any past and then existing defaults. On May 30, 2008, prior to the expiration of the
waiver, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of the credit agreement governing its credit facility (Amendment No. 5) (See Note 7). After giving effect to Amendment No. 5, the Company believes that it was in compliance with
all financial covenants of its credit facility. Based upon such compliance and other factors, the Company believes that the going concern contingency no longer exists. Thus, the Company reclassified on its balance sheet as of June 30, 2008 the
long-term debt under the senior credit facility previously reported as current, to long-term. Additionally, related deferred financing costs that had been classified as other current assets as of December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008 have
been reclassified to intangible assets as of June 30, 2008 in the amount of approximately $21,000 which included approximately $8,500 of deferred financing costs capitalized during the second quarter of 2008 incurred in connection with the
amendments.  As a result of the Companys amendment and restatement of its senior credit facility described above, on August 4,
2008, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm reissued its report relating to the Companys financial statements as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2007 to remove the explanatory paragraph with respect to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern and to insert an emphasis paragraph that the conditions that raised substantial doubt about whether the Company will
continue as a going concern no longer exist.  (b) Acquisition of Roll Covers Operation.  On November 29, 2007, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of a company which has two subsidiaries in China, one of which is 100% owned and
the other 90% owned, for $11,787, net of $799 cash

acquired. The purchase price was subject to a purchase price adjustment. The impact of the minority interest was not material to the Companys financial
statements, where it has been included in general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations and other long-term liabilities in the balance sheet. As a result of the transaction, the Company acquired two established roll covers
manufacturing plants in China whose results of operations have been included in the Companys consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. The Company recorded $6,722 and $917 of goodwill and intangible assets,
respectively, as a result of this transaction during 2007. The weighted average amortization period of these acquired intangible assets is approximately six years.  (c) Acquisition of PMA Shoji Co. Ltd.  On August 31, 2006 the Company acquired certain assets, and assumed certain
related liabilities, of PMA Shoji Co. Ltd. (PMA) for a total purchase price of $1,742, subject to certain adjustments, and assumed liabilities as follows:

in June 2007. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, PMAs results of operations have been included in the Companys consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.
 (d) Sale of Huyck Dewatering Equipment  On August 28, 2006 the Company completed the sale of its dewatering equipment business and received proceeds related thereto of $1,666. The dewatering equipment business involved the manufacture and sale of equipment utilized for the
purpose of enhancing the removal of water from the paper manufacturing process.  (e) Acquisition of Coldwater Covers, Inc.  On February 2, 2006 the Company acquired all of the capital stock of privately-held Coldwater Covers, Inc. (Coldwater) and a related
manufacturing facility for a total purchase price of $6,999, subject to certain adjustments, and assumed liabilities as follows:

Company History  Xerium Technologies, Inc.

Operations are strategically located in the major paper-making regions of the world, including North America, Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific. The Company was reorganized in connection with its initial public offering, which was completed on
May 19, 2005 (Note 2).  (a) Going Concern  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which is contingent upon, among other things, the Companys ability to comply with all debt covenants
under its existing senior credit facility. While the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its senior credit facility at December 31, 2007 and expects that it would generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service
the debt under the senior credit facility prior to the stated maturity of the debt if there is not otherwise an event of default under the debt, the Company anticipates to be in financial covenant non-compliance for the period ended March 31,
2008. Failing to meet a financial covenant under the senior credit facility constitutes an event of default, upon which the lenders could accelerate the debt under the senior credit facility, causing it to become due and payable.  As a result, the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 includes a reclassification of $641,179 to reflect as current the long-term debt
under the senior credit facility that is anticipated to be in default during the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, because this debt is potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps, hedge accounting under SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No. 133) was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps and the mark to market decrease in their fair value of $1,931 was recorded as a
charge to interest expense during the fourth quarter of 2007 (See Note 9).  On April 8, 2008, the Company entered into an amendment
and waiver agreement with its lenders relating to its senior credit facility pursuant to which the lenders agreed to waive through May 31, 2008 (the forbearance period) any past and then existing defaults. In connection with the
waiver agreement, the Company agreed that the lenders would not be required to make revolving loans during the forbearance period. The waiver agreement also contains restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, requirements that the Company:
  


 

 
 operate its business in the ordinary course;   


 

 
 not enter into any contract which will be binding or impose liabilities upon the Company or its subsidiaries other than in the ordinary course of business, except
as contemplated below and except in connection with any issuance of equity securities by the Company;   


 

 
 not (i) incur any indebtedness or create or become liable with respect to any contingent obligation other than contingent obligations permitted below;
provided that the Company may incur subordinated debt; so long as all of the net proceeds of such incurrence of subordinated debt are applied to prepay debt under the credit facility, (ii) forgive any indebtedness or other obligation
(other than customer receivables in connection with collection efforts in the ordinary course of business), (iii) make any loans, advances, dividends, capital contributions or any other investment, (with certain exceptions) or (iv) incur
capital expenditures in excess of certain limitations;

(ii) other than with limited exceptions, convey, sell, lease, sub-lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Companys business or assets, unless all of the net proceeds of such disposal are applied to prepay debt under the credit
facility or (iii) acquire all or a substantial part of the business or assets of, or capital stock or other evidence of beneficial ownership of, any person or any unit or division thereof, other than the acquisition and sale of inventory in the

 The Company is in discussions with its lenders to amend the financial covenants of its credit facility although no assurances can be given
that the Company will successfully amend such covenants, or amend such covenants in a manner sufficient to adequately reduce the risk of default in the near future. In connection with any such amendments, the lenders are likely to condition
agreement on substantial increases in the fees and interest rate payable under the credit facility.  (b) Acquisition of Roll Covers Operation.
 On November 29, 2007, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of a company which has two subsidiaries in China, one of which
is 90% owned, for $11,787, net of $799 cash acquired. The purchase price is subject to a purchase price adjustment. The impact of the minority interest is not material to the Companys financial statements, where it has been included in general
and administrative expenses on the statement of operations and other long-term liabilities in the balance sheet. As a result of the transaction, the Company has acquired two established roll covers manufacturing plants in China whose results of
