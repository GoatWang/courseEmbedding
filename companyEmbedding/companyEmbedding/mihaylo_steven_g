Steven G. Mihaylo

























































 


I believe all businesses have at least four constituencies: Customers, Shareholders, Employees and Suppliers. Unless the needs and expectations of all constituents are met, a business will not reach its full potential. Without happy, satisfied customers, a business cannot survive. Without shareholders receiving a fair return for the risks that they take with their capital, a business will not have the resources necessary to grow and create jobs. Without happy, fulfilled employees; customers and shareholders will not have their expectations met. And finally, without suppliers that are part of the partnership, the other three constituencies will not attain complete success.

Successful Alum Entrepreneur Supports
                    College of Business and Economics



Jan. 3, 2008 :: No. 121 
Only three days into 2008, Cal State Fullerton
                    starts the new year with a record-setting $30 million dollar
                    gift to the College of Business and Economics. The gift from
                    a grateful alumnus is the largest ever for Cal State Fullerton
                    and the fourth largest in the history of the entire California
                    State University system. 
Steven G. Mihaylo, a business administration
                    graduate (Class of 1969), successful telecom entrepreneur
                    and founder and retired CEO of Inter-Tel Inc., a manufacturer
                    of voice and data network equipment for small to mid-size
                    businesses worldwide, joined Cal State Fullerton President
                    Milton A. Gordon, College of Business and Economics Dean
                    Anil Puri and other CSUF leaders on campus today to announce
                    his gift. 


In the shadow of Mihaylo Hall - the new home of the College
                        of Business and Economics - faculty, staff and the press
                        gathered to hear the big announcement on January 3, 2008. 

In recognition of his generosity, the College
                    of Business and Economics will be named in Mihaylo’s
                    honor. The California State University Board of Trustees
                    is expected to approve the naming at its meeting Jan. 22-23.
University
                    leaders and faculty members expressed gratitude for “a
                    history-making gift that will ensure the college’s continued presence in the first rank of American business schools,” said President
                    Gordon.
“When we began celebrating our
                      50th anniversary last September, we never imagined that
                      the year would include a defining event in the future of
                      Cal State Fullerton,” Gordon
                    said. “We are indebted to Steve Mihaylo. His magnanimous
                    gift is not only an expression of gratitude to his alma mater,
                    but the strongest possible vote of confidence in this university’s
                    future.”
“Steve Mihaylo has presented this school
                    with a pivotal opportunity,” according
  to Puri. “His transformational gift will underwrite expanded faculty
  recruitment and retention efforts, and the innovative programs required to
  deliver a world-class business education for the young people of Southern California,” Puri
  explained, “establishing the Steven G. Mihaylo College of Business and
  Economics as one of the nation’s top tier business schools.”

As a donor, Mihaylo is no stranger to the
                    record books; thanks to his leadership gift of $4.5 million
                    in 2004-05, his name already graces the $87.5 million building
                    now under construction on the university campus’s southeast
                    corner.
When it
                    opens in fall 2008, Steven G. Mihaylo Hall will provide a
                    new home for the College of Business and Economics, with
                    a 250-seat lecture hall, more than 30 modern classrooms,
                    faculty and administrative offices, interactive technology
                    labs and 10,000 square feet of collaborative working space
                    for students. 
Mihaylo’s latest gift will support four
                    specific areas: endowed chairs; faculty support; student
                    scholarships; and programmatic initiatives, including enhanced
                    career placement services and expansion of the MBA program.
About Steven Mihaylo



Steven G. Mihaylo and Dean Anil Puri 

Mihaylo’s path to business success began
                    modestly. Following graduation from high school, the budding
                    entrepreneur spent three years in the U.S. Army, where he
                    took on tailoring jobs for additional cash. He attended Cal
                    State Fullerton on the GI Bill and supported himself by working
                    the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift at McDonnell Douglas. Mihaylo
                    spent the last two years of college working full time and
                    cramming every spare minute with schoolwork to complete his
                    degree, then turned down an offered accounting job to follow
                    his dream of building his own business.
“I knew that in a large
                    organization, it could take a long time to get established,” Mihaylo
                    said in 2004. “With my degree and the experience
  I had working in the technical field and in sales, I felt that I had all the
  ingredients to be an entrepreneur.”
He moved out of Orange County to Phoenix
                    and founded Inter-Tel in 1969 as a division of Panoramic
                      Audio — a company
                    he had worked for while attending college. By 1975, the company
                    had sales revenue of $1 million. Mihaylo served as CEO until
                    February 2006, the year annual revenues topped more than
                    $458 million; the company was sold in 2007.
“Over the years, I have been grateful for the education that I received
                    at California State University, Fullerton and for the opportunities that I
                    was afforded,” Mihaylo said. “It is an honor to support the mission
                    of the College of Business and Economics and to help support the growth of
                    an institution where all students have the opportunity to succeed.”
