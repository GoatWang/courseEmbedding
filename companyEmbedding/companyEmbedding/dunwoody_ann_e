She was nominated as Commanding General, U.S. Army Materiel Command, by President George W. Bush on June 23, 2008, and confirmed by the Senate one month later.[5] She served in that capacity until August 7, 2012,[6] and retired from the Army on August 15, 2012.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Dunwoody was born in 1953[7] at Fort Belvoir, Virginia[8][9] to Elizabeth and Harold Dunwoody. Her father was a career Army officer, and the family lived in Germany and Belgium while she was growing up. She graduated from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) American High School in 1971.[citation needed] At age 5, Dunwoody decided she wanted nothing more than to become a physical education teacher/coach. Although she came from a family with a strong tradition of military service, she had very little interest in serving in the military. After high school Dunwoody attended State University of New York College at Cortland (A top 10 school for Physical Education) to achieve this goal. During her junior year of college, Dunwoody attended a four-week Army introductory program that could be continued, if interested, with an eleven-week Women's Officer Orientation Course, which then led to a two year commitment. In 1975 she committed and became a 2nd lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps where she learned to jump from airplanes. It was then that she realized the army was "an organization that was as values-based as the family I came out of, and to find probably my real passion was soldiering. I just didn't know it because I had never experienced it." [10]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Dunwoody graduated from State University of New York College at Cortland with a degree in physical education and was direct commissioned into the Women's Army Corps. In an interview with the Military Logistics Forum, Dunwoody explained what drew her to become a soldier:

"I grew up in the Army and came from a family who, since 1862, has defended our nation. My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father, my brother, my sister, my niece and my husband are all veterans of this country’s wars. My father is a veteran of three wars and is one of the 25 million veterans living today who served the nation with such incredible courage.


While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill than the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."

Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. During her 30+ years as a Quartermaster Corps officer she has commanded the 226th Maintenance Company Fort Sill, OK; 5th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne) Kaiserslautern, Germany; the 407th Supply and Service Battalion/ 782d Main Support Battalion (MSB), Fort Bragg, NC; the 10th Mountain Division Support Command (DISCOM), Fort Drum, NY; the 1st Corps Support Command (1st COSCOM), Fort Bragg, NC; the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC)/Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Alexandria, VA; and the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), Fort Lee, VA.
Her major staff assignments include service as the Parachute Officer, 82nd Airborne Division; strategic planner for the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA); Executive Officer to the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics G-4.
From May 1989 to May 1991, Dunwoody served as executive officer and later division parachute officer for the 407th Supply and Transportation Battalion, 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg and deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm.[11] in 2001, As the 1st Corps Support Command Commander she deployed the Logistics Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 1 and stood up the Joint Logistics Command in Uzbekistan in support of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)-180. As Commander of Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since World War II.
Sexual assault prevention[edit]
Dunwoody, along with George W. Casey, Jr. were very avid in pushing for a decrease in sexual assault within the U.S. Army. Dunwoody believes that the U.S. Army should set an example for the rest of the world, and that they have a long way to go in order to significantly decrease sexual assault, but they are making progress.[12]
Logistics[edit]
Dunwoody was in charge of all Army logistics. Her education came from the Florida Institute of Technology and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. During her career, Dunwoody managed the largest global logistics command in Army history (69,000 military and civilians, located in all 50 states and more than 140 countries). Along with that she managed a budget of $60 billion and was responsible for oversight of approximately $70 billion in service contracts. As well as “managed and operationalized the Army's global supply chain for numerous engagements” LMI President and CEO Nelson M. Ford commented:“Ann Dunwoody is highly respected within the logistics and defense community for her remarkable clarity of thought and strategic vision, and we welcome her insight and wisdom to LMI’s Board of Directors,” Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno claimed that Dunwoody was "quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had” [13]
Dunwoody participated with First Lady Michelle Obama in a forum for promising girls in Washington, D.C. public schools in March 2009.
Dunwoody officially retired from the U.S. Army after 37 years on August 15, 2012.[1]
Career firsts[edit]




Dunwoody is pinned with her four stars by Army Chief of Staff General Casey and her husband Craig Brotchie.


Among her notable firsts, she became the first woman to command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division in 1992. She became Fort Bragg's first female general officer in 2000. She became the first woman to command the Combined Arms Support Command at Fort Lee, Virginia, in 2004. And in 2005, Dunwoody became the first female soldier to achieve three-star rank since LTG Claudia J. Kennedy, the former Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, who retired in 2000.
On November 14, 2008, Dunwoody became the first woman in U.S. military history to achieve the rank of four-star General.[14] Her promotion ceremony was held at the Pentagon, with introductory speeches by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates[15] and Army Chief of Staff General George W. Casey.[16]

Personal life[edit]

Dunwoody was born to Harold (d.2015) and Elizabeth (d.2006) Dunwoody. She has two siblings: Harold H. Dunwoody “Buck” (First Lieutenant-Army), and Susan Schoeck (Army Pilot). In 1989 she married Colonel Craig Brotchie, USAF (retired). They currently have no children, but own a dog named Barney. Dunwoody currently lives with her husband in Tampa, Florida where her brother and sister live, and where her husband currently serves on the board of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.[18]
Dunwoody has a long family history of U.S. military service – going back five generations.[15] She grew up in a military household, the daughter of Elizabeth (died 2006, age 81) and Harold H. Dunwoody (born Jan. 9, 1919- died Sept 6, 2015, age 96) in Englewood, Florida).
Her great-grandfather, Brigadier General Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody,[19] an 1866 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy,[19] was the Chief Signal Officer in Cuba from 1898 to 1901.[16] Her father retired from the U.S. Army as a Brigadier General in 1973. Brigadier General Dunwoody is a highly decorated veteran of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.[16] He was badly wounded in France during World War II and earned the Distinguished Service Cross for bravery while serving as a battalion commander in the Korean War.[16] As a Brigadier General, he commanded the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) during the Vietnam War.
Her brother, Harold H. "Buck" Dunwoody, Jr. is a 1970 West Point graduate.
Her older sister, Susan Schoeck, was the third woman in the Army to become a helicopter pilot.[20]
Her niece, Jennifer Schoeck, is a U.S. Air Force fighter pilot.[20]
Dunwoody is the daughter of Harold Dunwoody, her inspiration "My own personal hero is my dad, he is a proud World War II, Korea, Vietnam veteran," she said. "And he was a real soldier's soldier. And much of who I am is founded on what I learned from my dad, as a soldier, as a patriot and as a father." [21]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Ann Elizabeth Dunwoody (born January 14, 1953)[2][3] is a retired general of the United States Army. She was the first woman in U.S. military and uniformed service history to achieve a four-star officer rank, receiving her fourth star on November 14, 2008.[4]
In 2005 Dunwoody became the Army's top-ranking female when she received the promotion to lieutenant general (three stars) and became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4 (logistics). She was nominated as Commanding General, U.S. Army Materiel Command, by President George W. Bush on June 23, 2008, and confirmed by the Senate one month later.[5] She served in that capacity until August 7, 2012,[6] and retired from the Army on August 15, 2012.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Dunwoody was born in 1953[7] at Fort Belvoir, Virginia[8][9] to Elizabeth and Harold Dunwoody. Her father was a career Army officer, and the family lived in Germany and Belgium while she was growing up. She graduated from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) American High School in 1971.[citation needed] At age 5, Dunwoody decided she wanted nothing more than to become a physical education teacher/coach. Although she came from a family with a strong tradition of military service, she had very little interest in serving in the military. After high school Dunwoody attended State University of New York College at Cortland (A top 10 school for Physical Education) to achieve this goal. During her junior year of college, Dunwoody attended a four-week Army introductory program that could be continued, if interested, with an eleven-week Women's Officer Orientation Course, which then led to a two year commitment. In 1975 she committed and became a 2nd lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps where she learned to jump from airplanes. It was then that she realized the army was "an organization that was as values-based as the family I came out of, and to find probably my real passion was soldiering. I just didn't know it because I had never experienced it." [10]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Dunwoody graduated from State University of New York College at Cortland with a degree in physical education and was direct commissioned into the Women's Army Corps. In an interview with the Military Logistics Forum, Dunwoody explained what drew her to become a soldier:

"I grew up in the Army and came from a family who, since 1862, has defended our nation. My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father, my brother, my sister, my niece and my husband are all veterans of this country’s wars. My father is a veteran of three wars and is one of the 25 million veterans living today who served the nation with such incredible courage.


While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill than the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."

Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. During her 30+ years as a Quartermaster Corps officer she has commanded the 226th Maintenance Company Fort Sill, OK; 5th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne) Kaiserslautern, Germany; the 407th Supply and Service Battalion/ 782d Main Support Battalion (MSB), Fort Bragg, NC; the 10th Mountain Division Support Command (DISCOM), Fort Drum, NY; the 1st Corps Support Command (1st COSCOM), Fort Bragg, NC; the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC)/Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Alexandria, VA; and the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), Fort Lee, VA.
Her major staff assignments include service as the Parachute Officer, 82nd Airborne Division; strategic planner for the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA); Executive Officer to the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics G-4.
From May 1989 to May 1991, Dunwoody served as executive officer and later division parachute officer for the 407th Supply and Transportation Battalion, 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg and deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm.[11] in 2001, As the 1st Corps Support Command Commander she deployed the Logistics Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 1 and stood up the Joint Logistics Command in Uzbekistan in support of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)-180. As Commander of Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since World War II.
Sexual assault prevention[edit]
Dunwoody, along with George W. Casey, Jr. were very avid in pushing for a decrease in sexual assault within the U.S. Army. Dunwoody believes that the U.S. Army should set an example for the rest of the world, and that they have a long way to go in order to significantly decrease sexual assault, but they are making progress.[12]
Logistics[edit]
Dunwoody was in charge of all Army logistics. Her education came from the Florida Institute of Technology and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. During her career, Dunwoody managed the largest global logistics command in Army history (69,000 military and civilians, located in all 50 states and more than 140 countries). Along with that she managed a budget of $60 billion and was responsible for oversight of approximately $70 billion in service contracts. As well as “managed and operationalized the Army's global supply chain for numerous engagements” LMI President and CEO Nelson M. Ford commented:“Ann Dunwoody is highly respected within the logistics and defense community for her remarkable clarity of thought and strategic vision, and we welcome her insight and wisdom to LMI’s Board of Directors,” Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno claimed that Dunwoody was "quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had” [13]
Dunwoody participated with First Lady Michelle Obama in a forum for promising girls in Washington, D.C. public schools in March 2009.
Dunwoody officially retired from the U.S. Army after 37 years on August 15, 2012.[1]
Career firsts[edit]




Dunwoody is pinned with her four stars by Army Chief of Staff General Casey and her husband Craig Brotchie.


Among her notable firsts, she became the first woman to command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division in 1992. She became Fort Bragg's first female general officer in 2000. She became the first woman to command the Combined Arms Support Command at Fort Lee, Virginia, in 2004. And in 2005, Dunwoody became the first female soldier to achieve three-star rank since LTG Claudia J. Kennedy, the former Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, who retired in 2000.
On November 14, 2008, Dunwoody became the first woman in U.S. military history to achieve the rank of four-star General.[14] Her promotion ceremony was held at the Pentagon, with introductory speeches by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates[15] and Army Chief of Staff General George W. Casey.[16]

Personal life[edit]




New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi with General Dunwoody during the Yankees vs. New York Mets game on June 14, 2009.


Dunwoody was born to Harold (d.2015) and Elizabeth (d.2006) Dunwoody. She has two siblings: Harold H. Dunwoody “Buck” (First Lieutenant-Army), and Susan Schoeck (Army Pilot). In 1989 she married Colonel Craig Brotchie, USAF (retired). They currently have no children, but own a dog named Barney. Dunwoody currently lives with her husband in Tampa, Florida where her brother and sister live, and where her husband currently serves on the board of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.[18]
Dunwoody has a long family history of U.S. military service – going back five generations.[15] She grew up in a military household, the daughter of Elizabeth (died 2006, age 81) and Harold H. Dunwoody (born Jan. 9, 1919- died Sept 6, 2015, age 96) in Englewood, Florida).
Her great-grandfather, Brigadier General Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody,[19] an 1866 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy,[19] was the Chief Signal Officer in Cuba from 1898 to 1901.[16] Her father retired from the U.S. Army as a Brigadier General in 1973. Brigadier General Dunwoody is a highly decorated veteran of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.[16] He was badly wounded in France during World War II and earned the Distinguished Service Cross for bravery while serving as a battalion commander in the Korean War.[16] As a Brigadier General, he commanded the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) during the Vietnam War.
Her brother, Harold H. "Buck" Dunwoody, Jr. is a 1970 West Point graduate.
Her older sister, Susan Schoeck, was the third woman in the Army to become a helicopter pilot.[20]
Her niece, Jennifer Schoeck, is a U.S. Air Force fighter pilot.[20]
Dunwoody is the daughter of Harold Dunwoody, her inspiration "My own personal hero is my dad, he is a proud World War II, Korea, Vietnam veteran," she said. "And he was a real soldier's soldier. And much of who I am is founded on what I learned from my dad, as a soldier, as a patriot and as a father." [21]

In 2005 Dunwoody became the Army's top-ranking female when she received the promotion to lieutenant general (three stars) and became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4 (logistics). She was nominated as Commanding General, U.S. Army Materiel Command, by President George W. Bush on June 23, 2008, and confirmed by the Senate one month later.[5] She served in that capacity until August 7, 2012,[6] and retired from the Army on August 15, 2012.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Dunwoody was born in 1953[7] at Fort Belvoir, Virginia[8][9] to Elizabeth and Harold Dunwoody. Her father was a career Army officer, and the family lived in Germany and Belgium while she was growing up. She graduated from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) American High School in 1971.[citation needed] At age 5, Dunwoody decided she wanted nothing more than to become a physical education teacher/coach. Although she came from a family with a strong tradition of military service, she had very little interest in serving in the military. After high school Dunwoody attended State University of New York College at Cortland (A top 10 school for Physical Education) to achieve this goal. During her junior year of college, Dunwoody attended a four-week Army introductory program that could be continued, if interested, with an eleven-week Women's Officer Orientation Course, which then led to a two year commitment. In 1975 she committed and became a 2nd lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps where she learned to jump from airplanes. It was then that she realized the army was "an organization that was as values-based as the family I came out of, and to find probably my real passion was soldiering. I just didn't know it because I had never experienced it." [10]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Dunwoody graduated from State University of New York College at Cortland with a degree in physical education and was direct commissioned into the Women's Army Corps. In an interview with the Military Logistics Forum, Dunwoody explained what drew her to become a soldier:

"I grew up in the Army and came from a family who, since 1862, has defended our nation. My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father, my brother, my sister, my niece and my husband are all veterans of this country’s wars. My father is a veteran of three wars and is one of the 25 million veterans living today who served the nation with such incredible courage.


While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill than the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."

Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. During her 30+ years as a Quartermaster Corps officer she has commanded the 226th Maintenance Company Fort Sill, OK; 5th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne) Kaiserslautern, Germany; the 407th Supply and Service Battalion/ 782d Main Support Battalion (MSB), Fort Bragg, NC; the 10th Mountain Division Support Command (DISCOM), Fort Drum, NY; the 1st Corps Support Command (1st COSCOM), Fort Bragg, NC; the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC)/Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Alexandria, VA; and the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), Fort Lee, VA.
Her major staff assignments include service as the Parachute Officer, 82nd Airborne Division; strategic planner for the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA); Executive Officer to the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics G-4.
From May 1989 to May 1991, Dunwoody served as executive officer and later division parachute officer for the 407th Supply and Transportation Battalion, 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg and deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm.[11] in 2001, As the 1st Corps Support Command Commander she deployed the Logistics Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 1 and stood up the Joint Logistics Command in Uzbekistan in support of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)-180. As Commander of Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since World War II.
Sexual assault prevention[edit]
Dunwoody, along with George W. Casey, Jr. were very avid in pushing for a decrease in sexual assault within the U.S. Army. Dunwoody believes that the U.S. Army should set an example for the rest of the world, and that they have a long way to go in order to significantly decrease sexual assault, but they are making progress.[12]
Logistics[edit]
Dunwoody was in charge of all Army logistics. Her education came from the Florida Institute of Technology and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. During her career, Dunwoody managed the largest global logistics command in Army history (69,000 military and civilians, located in all 50 states and more than 140 countries). Along with that she managed a budget of $60 billion and was responsible for oversight of approximately $70 billion in service contracts. As well as “managed and operationalized the Army's global supply chain for numerous engagements” LMI President and CEO Nelson M. Ford commented:“Ann Dunwoody is highly respected within the logistics and defense community for her remarkable clarity of thought and strategic vision, and we welcome her insight and wisdom to LMI’s Board of Directors,” Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno claimed that Dunwoody was "quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had” [13]
Dunwoody participated with First Lady Michelle Obama in a forum for promising girls in Washington, D.C. public schools in March 2009.
Dunwoody officially retired from the U.S. Army after 37 years on August 15, 2012.[1]
Career firsts[edit]




Dunwoody is pinned with her four stars by Army Chief of Staff General Casey and her husband Craig Brotchie.


Among her notable firsts, she became the first woman to command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division in 1992. She became Fort Bragg's first female general officer in 2000. She became the first woman to command the Combined Arms Support Command at Fort Lee, Virginia, in 2004. And in 2005, Dunwoody became the first female soldier to achieve three-star rank since LTG Claudia J. Kennedy, the former Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, who retired in 2000.
On November 14, 2008, Dunwoody became the first woman in U.S. military history to achieve the rank of four-star General.[14] Her promotion ceremony was held at the Pentagon, with introductory speeches by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates[15] and Army Chief of Staff General George W. Casey.[16]

Early life and education[edit]
Dunwoody was born in 1953[7] at Fort Belvoir, Virginia[8][9] to Elizabeth and Harold Dunwoody. Her father was a career Army officer, and the family lived in Germany and Belgium while she was growing up. She graduated from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) American High School in 1971.[citation needed] At age 5, Dunwoody decided she wanted nothing more than to become a physical education teacher/coach. Although she came from a family with a strong tradition of military service, she had very little interest in serving in the military. After high school Dunwoody attended State University of New York College at Cortland (A top 10 school for Physical Education) to achieve this goal. During her junior year of college, Dunwoody attended a four-week Army introductory program that could be continued, if interested, with an eleven-week Women's Officer Orientation Course, which then led to a two year commitment. In 1975 she committed and became a 2nd lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps where she learned to jump from airplanes. It was then that she realized the army was "an organization that was as values-based as the family I came out of, and to find probably my real passion was soldiering. I just didn't know it because I had never experienced it." [10]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Dunwoody graduated from State University of New York College at Cortland with a degree in physical education and was direct commissioned into the Women's Army Corps. In an interview with the Military Logistics Forum, Dunwoody explained what drew her to become a soldier:

"I grew up in the Army and came from a family who, since 1862, has defended our nation. My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father, my brother, my sister, my niece and my husband are all veterans of this country’s wars. My father is a veteran of three wars and is one of the 25 million veterans living today who served the nation with such incredible courage.


While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill than the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."

Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. During her 30+ years as a Quartermaster Corps officer she has commanded the 226th Maintenance Company Fort Sill, OK; 5th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne) Kaiserslautern, Germany; the 407th Supply and Service Battalion/ 782d Main Support Battalion (MSB), Fort Bragg, NC; the 10th Mountain Division Support Command (DISCOM), Fort Drum, NY; the 1st Corps Support Command (1st COSCOM), Fort Bragg, NC; the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC)/Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Alexandria, VA; and the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), Fort Lee, VA.
Her major staff assignments include service as the Parachute Officer, 82nd Airborne Division; strategic planner for the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA); Executive Officer to the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics G-4.
From May 1989 to May 1991, Dunwoody served as executive officer and later division parachute officer for the 407th Supply and Transportation Battalion, 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg and deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm.[11] in 2001, As the 1st Corps Support Command Commander she deployed the Logistics Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 1 and stood up the Joint Logistics Command in Uzbekistan in support of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)-180. As Commander of Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since World War II.
Sexual assault prevention[edit]
Dunwoody, along with George W. Casey, Jr. were very avid in pushing for a decrease in sexual assault within the U.S. Army. Dunwoody believes that the U.S. Army should set an example for the rest of the world, and that they have a long way to go in order to significantly decrease sexual assault, but they are making progress.[12]
Logistics[edit]
Dunwoody was in charge of all Army logistics. Her education came from the Florida Institute of Technology and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. During her career, Dunwoody managed the largest global logistics command in Army history (69,000 military and civilians, located in all 50 states and more than 140 countries). Along with that she managed a budget of $60 billion and was responsible for oversight of approximately $70 billion in service contracts. As well as “managed and operationalized the Army's global supply chain for numerous engagements” LMI President and CEO Nelson M. Ford commented:“Ann Dunwoody is highly respected within the logistics and defense community for her remarkable clarity of thought and strategic vision, and we welcome her insight and wisdom to LMI’s Board of Directors,” Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno claimed that Dunwoody was "quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had” [13]
Dunwoody participated with First Lady Michelle Obama in a forum for promising girls in Washington, D.C. public schools in March 2009.
Dunwoody officially retired from the U.S. Army after 37 years on August 15, 2012.[1]
Career firsts[edit]




Dunwoody is pinned with her four stars by Army Chief of Staff General Casey and her husband Craig Brotchie.


Among her notable firsts, she became the first woman to command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division in 1992. She became Fort Bragg's first female general officer in 2000. She became the first woman to command the Combined Arms Support Command at Fort Lee, Virginia, in 2004. And in 2005, Dunwoody became the first female soldier to achieve three-star rank since LTG Claudia J. Kennedy, the former Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, who retired in 2000.
On November 14, 2008, Dunwoody became the first woman in U.S. military history to achieve the rank of four-star General.[14] Her promotion ceremony was held at the Pentagon, with introductory speeches by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates[15] and Army Chief of Staff General George W. Casey.[16]

Early life and education[edit]
Dunwoody was born in 1953[7] at Fort Belvoir, Virginia[8][9] to Elizabeth and Harold Dunwoody. Her father was a career Army officer, and the family lived in Germany and Belgium while she was growing up. She graduated from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) American High School in 1971.[citation needed] At age 5, Dunwoody decided she wanted nothing more than to become a physical education teacher/coach. Although she came from a family with a strong tradition of military service, she had very little interest in serving in the military. After high school Dunwoody attended State University of New York College at Cortland (A top 10 school for Physical Education) to achieve this goal. During her junior year of college, Dunwoody attended a four-week Army introductory program that could be continued, if interested, with an eleven-week Women's Officer Orientation Course, which then led to a two year commitment. In 1975 she committed and became a 2nd lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps where she learned to jump from airplanes. It was then that she realized the army was "an organization that was as values-based as the family I came out of, and to find probably my real passion was soldiering. I just didn't know it because I had never experienced it." [10]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Dunwoody graduated from State University of New York College at Cortland with a degree in physical education and was direct commissioned into the Women's Army Corps. In an interview with the Military Logistics Forum, Dunwoody explained what drew her to become a soldier:

"I grew up in the Army and came from a family who, since 1862, has defended our nation. My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father, my brother, my sister, my niece and my husband are all veterans of this country’s wars. My father is a veteran of three wars and is one of the 25 million veterans living today who served the nation with such incredible courage.


While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill than the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."

Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. During her 30+ years as a Quartermaster Corps officer she has commanded the 226th Maintenance Company Fort Sill, OK; 5th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne) Kaiserslautern, Germany; the 407th Supply and Service Battalion/ 782d Main Support Battalion (MSB), Fort Bragg, NC; the 10th Mountain Division Support Command (DISCOM), Fort Drum, NY; the 1st Corps Support Command (1st COSCOM), Fort Bragg, NC; the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC)/Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Alexandria, VA; and the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), Fort Lee, VA.
Her major staff assignments include service as the Parachute Officer, 82nd Airborne Division; strategic planner for the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA); Executive Officer to the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics G-4.
From May 1989 to May 1991, Dunwoody served as executive officer and later division parachute officer for the 407th Supply and Transportation Battalion, 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg and deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm.[11] in 2001, As the 1st Corps Support Command Commander she deployed the Logistics Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 1 and stood up the Joint Logistics Command in Uzbekistan in support of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)-180. As Commander of Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since World War II.

Dunwoody believes that the U.S. Army should set an example for the rest of the world, and that they have a long way to go in order to significantly decrease sexual assault, but they are making progress.[12]

Ray Odierno claimed that Dunwoody was "quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had” [13]
Dunwoody participated with First Lady Michelle Obama in a forum for promising girls in Washington, D.C. public schools in March 2009.

In 2005 Dunwoody became the Army's top-ranking female when she received the promotion to lieutenant general (three stars) and became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4 (logistics). She was nominated as Commanding General, U.S. Army Materiel Command, by President George W. Bush on June 23, 2008, and confirmed by the Senate one month later.[5] She served in that capacity until August 7, 2012,[6] and retired from the Army on August 15, 2012.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Dunwoody was born in 1953[7] at Fort Belvoir, Virginia[8][9] to Elizabeth and Harold Dunwoody. Her father was a career Army officer, and the family lived in Germany and Belgium while she was growing up. She graduated from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) American High School in 1971.[citation needed] At age 5, Dunwoody decided she wanted nothing more than to become a physical education teacher/coach. Although she came from a family with a strong tradition of military service, she had very little interest in serving in the military. After high school Dunwoody attended State University of New York College at Cortland (A top 10 school for Physical Education) to achieve this goal. During her junior year of college, Dunwoody attended a four-week Army introductory program that could be continued, if interested, with an eleven-week Women's Officer Orientation Course, which then led to a two year commitment. In 1975 she committed and became a 2nd lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps where she learned to jump from airplanes. It was then that she realized the army was "an organization that was as values-based as the family I came out of, and to find probably my real passion was soldiering. I just didn't know it because I had never experienced it." [10]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Dunwoody graduated from State University of New York College at Cortland with a degree in physical education and was direct commissioned into the Women's Army Corps. In an interview with the Military Logistics Forum, Dunwoody explained what drew her to become a soldier:

"I grew up in the Army and came from a family who, since 1862, has defended our nation. My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father, my brother, my sister, my niece and my husband are all veterans of this country’s wars. My father is a veteran of three wars and is one of the 25 million veterans living today who served the nation with such incredible courage.


While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill than the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."

Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. During her 30+ years as a Quartermaster Corps officer she has commanded the 226th Maintenance Company Fort Sill, OK; 5th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne) Kaiserslautern, Germany; the 407th Supply and Service Battalion/ 782d Main Support Battalion (MSB), Fort Bragg, NC; the 10th Mountain Division Support Command (DISCOM), Fort Drum, NY; the 1st Corps Support Command (1st COSCOM), Fort Bragg, NC; the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC)/Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Alexandria, VA; and the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), Fort Lee, VA.
Her major staff assignments include service as the Parachute Officer, 82nd Airborne Division; strategic planner for the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA); Executive Officer to the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics G-4.
From May 1989 to May 1991, Dunwoody served as executive officer and later division parachute officer for the 407th Supply and Transportation Battalion, 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg and deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm.[11] in 2001, As the 1st Corps Support Command Commander she deployed the Logistics Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 1 and stood up the Joint Logistics Command in Uzbekistan in support of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)-180. As Commander of Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since World War II.
Sexual assault prevention[edit]
Dunwoody, along with George W. Casey, Jr. were very avid in pushing for a decrease in sexual assault within the U.S. Army. Dunwoody believes that the U.S. Army should set an example for the rest of the world, and that they have a long way to go in order to significantly decrease sexual assault, but they are making progress.[12]
Logistics[edit]
Dunwoody was in charge of all Army logistics. Her education came from the Florida Institute of Technology and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. During her career, Dunwoody managed the largest global logistics command in Army history (69,000 military and civilians, located in all 50 states and more than 140 countries). Along with that she managed a budget of $60 billion and was responsible for oversight of approximately $70 billion in service contracts. As well as “managed and operationalized the Army's global supply chain for numerous engagements” LMI President and CEO Nelson M. Ford commented:“Ann Dunwoody is highly respected within the logistics and defense community for her remarkable clarity of thought and strategic vision, and we welcome her insight and wisdom to LMI’s Board of Directors,” Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno claimed that Dunwoody was "quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had” [13]
Dunwoody participated with First Lady Michelle Obama in a forum for promising girls in Washington, D.C. public schools in March 2009.
Dunwoody officially retired from the U.S. Army after 37 years on August 15, 2012.[1]
Career firsts[edit]




Dunwoody is pinned with her four stars by Army Chief of Staff General Casey and her husband Craig Brotchie.


Among her notable firsts, she became the first woman to command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division in 1992. She became Fort Bragg's first female general officer in 2000. She became the first woman to command the Combined Arms Support Command at Fort Lee, Virginia, in 2004. And in 2005, Dunwoody became the first female soldier to achieve three-star rank since LTG Claudia J. Kennedy, the former Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, who retired in 2000.
On November 14, 2008, Dunwoody became the first woman in U.S. military history to achieve the rank of four-star General.[14] Her promotion ceremony was held at the Pentagon, with introductory speeches by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates[15] and Army Chief of Staff General George W. Casey.[16]

Ann Elizabeth Dunwoody (born January 14, 1953)[2][3] is a retired general of the United States Army. She was the first woman in U.S. military and uniformed service history to achieve a four-star officer rank, receiving her fourth star on November 14, 2008.[4]
In 2005 Dunwoody became the Army's top-ranking female when she received the promotion to lieutenant general (three stars) and became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4 (logistics). She was nominated as Commanding General, U.S. Army Materiel Command, by President George W. Bush on June 23, 2008, and confirmed by the Senate one month later.[5] She served in that capacity until August 7, 2012,[6] and retired from the Army on August 15, 2012.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Dunwoody was born in 1953[7] at Fort Belvoir, Virginia[8][9] to Elizabeth and Harold Dunwoody. Her father was a career Army officer, and the family lived in Germany and Belgium while she was growing up. She graduated from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) American High School in 1971.[citation needed] At age 5, Dunwoody decided she wanted nothing more than to become a physical education teacher/coach. Although she came from a family with a strong tradition of military service, she had very little interest in serving in the military. After high school Dunwoody attended State University of New York College at Cortland (A top 10 school for Physical Education) to achieve this goal. During her junior year of college, Dunwoody attended a four-week Army introductory program that could be continued, if interested, with an eleven-week Women's Officer Orientation Course, which then led to a two year commitment. In 1975 she committed and became a 2nd lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps where she learned to jump from airplanes. It was then that she realized the army was "an organization that was as values-based as the family I came out of, and to find probably my real passion was soldiering. I just didn't know it because I had never experienced it." [10]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Dunwoody graduated from State University of New York College at Cortland with a degree in physical education and was direct commissioned into the Women's Army Corps. In an interview with the Military Logistics Forum, Dunwoody explained what drew her to become a soldier:

"I grew up in the Army and came from a family who, since 1862, has defended our nation. My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father, my brother, my sister, my niece and my husband are all veterans of this country’s wars. My father is a veteran of three wars and is one of the 25 million veterans living today who served the nation with such incredible courage.


While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill than the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."

Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. During her 30+ years as a Quartermaster Corps officer she has commanded the 226th Maintenance Company Fort Sill, OK; 5th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne) Kaiserslautern, Germany; the 407th Supply and Service Battalion/ 782d Main Support Battalion (MSB), Fort Bragg, NC; the 10th Mountain Division Support Command (DISCOM), Fort Drum, NY; the 1st Corps Support Command (1st COSCOM), Fort Bragg, NC; the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC)/Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Alexandria, VA; and the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), Fort Lee, VA.
Her major staff assignments include service as the Parachute Officer, 82nd Airborne Division; strategic planner for the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA); Executive Officer to the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics G-4.
From May 1989 to May 1991, Dunwoody served as executive officer and later division parachute officer for the 407th Supply and Transportation Battalion, 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg and deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm.[11] in 2001, As the 1st Corps Support Command Commander she deployed the Logistics Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 1 and stood up the Joint Logistics Command in Uzbekistan in support of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)-180. As Commander of Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since World War II.
Sexual assault prevention[edit]
Dunwoody, along with George W. Casey, Jr. were very avid in pushing for a decrease in sexual assault within the U.S. Army. Dunwoody believes that the U.S. Army should set an example for the rest of the world, and that they have a long way to go in order to significantly decrease sexual assault, but they are making progress.[12]
Logistics[edit]
Dunwoody was in charge of all Army logistics. Her education came from the Florida Institute of Technology and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. During her career, Dunwoody managed the largest global logistics command in Army history (69,000 military and civilians, located in all 50 states and more than 140 countries). Along with that she managed a budget of $60 billion and was responsible for oversight of approximately $70 billion in service contracts. As well as “managed and operationalized the Army's global supply chain for numerous engagements” LMI President and CEO Nelson M. Ford commented:“Ann Dunwoody is highly respected within the logistics and defense community for her remarkable clarity of thought and strategic vision, and we welcome her insight and wisdom to LMI’s Board of Directors,” Army Chief of Staff Gen.

In 2005 Dunwoody became the Army's top-ranking female when she received the promotion to lieutenant general (three stars) and became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4 (logistics). She was nominated as Commanding General, U.S. Army Materiel Command, by President George W. Bush on June 23, 2008, and confirmed by the Senate one month later.[5] She served in that capacity until August 7, 2012,[6] and retired from the Army on August 15, 2012.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Dunwoody was born in 1953[7] at Fort Belvoir, Virginia[8][9] to Elizabeth and Harold Dunwoody. Her father was a career Army officer, and the family lived in Germany and Belgium while she was growing up. She graduated from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) American High School in 1971.[citation needed] At age 5, Dunwoody decided she wanted nothing more than to become a physical education teacher/coach. Although she came from a family with a strong tradition of military service, she had very little interest in serving in the military. After high school Dunwoody attended State University of New York College at Cortland (A top 10 school for Physical Education) to achieve this goal. During her junior year of college, Dunwoody attended a four-week Army introductory program that could be continued, if interested, with an eleven-week Women's Officer Orientation Course, which then led to a two year commitment. In 1975 she committed and became a 2nd lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps where she learned to jump from airplanes. It was then that she realized the army was "an organization that was as values-based as the family I came out of, and to find probably my real passion was soldiering. I just didn't know it because I had never experienced it." [10]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Dunwoody graduated from State University of New York College at Cortland with a degree in physical education and was direct commissioned into the Women's Army Corps. In an interview with the Military Logistics Forum, Dunwoody explained what drew her to become a soldier:

"I grew up in the Army and came from a family who, since 1862, has defended our nation. My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father, my brother, my sister, my niece and my husband are all veterans of this country’s wars. My father is a veteran of three wars and is one of the 25 million veterans living today who served the nation with such incredible courage.


While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill than the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."

Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. During her 30+ years as a Quartermaster Corps officer she has commanded the 226th Maintenance Company Fort Sill, OK; 5th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne) Kaiserslautern, Germany; the 407th Supply and Service Battalion/ 782d Main Support Battalion (MSB), Fort Bragg, NC; the 10th Mountain Division Support Command (DISCOM), Fort Drum, NY; the 1st Corps Support Command (1st COSCOM), Fort Bragg, NC; the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC)/Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Alexandria, VA; and the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), Fort Lee, VA.
Her major staff assignments include service as the Parachute Officer, 82nd Airborne Division; strategic planner for the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA); Executive Officer to the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics G-4.
From May 1989 to May 1991, Dunwoody served as executive officer and later division parachute officer for the 407th Supply and Transportation Battalion, 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg and deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm.[11] in 2001, As the 1st Corps Support Command Commander she deployed the Logistics Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 1 and stood up the Joint Logistics Command in Uzbekistan in support of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)-180. As Commander of Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since World War II.
Sexual assault prevention[edit]
Dunwoody, along with George W. Casey, Jr. were very avid in pushing for a decrease in sexual assault within the U.S. Army. Dunwoody believes that the U.S. Army should set an example for the rest of the world, and that they have a long way to go in order to significantly decrease sexual assault, but they are making progress.[12]
Logistics[edit]
Dunwoody was in charge of all Army logistics. Her education came from the Florida Institute of Technology and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. During her career, Dunwoody managed the largest global logistics command in Army history (69,000 military and civilians, located in all 50 states and more than 140 countries). Along with that she managed a budget of $60 billion and was responsible for oversight of approximately $70 billion in service contracts. As well as “managed and operationalized the Army's global supply chain for numerous engagements” LMI President and CEO Nelson M. Ford commented:“Ann Dunwoody is highly respected within the logistics and defense community for her remarkable clarity of thought and strategic vision, and we welcome her insight and wisdom to LMI’s Board of Directors,” Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno claimed that Dunwoody was "quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had” [13]
Dunwoody participated with First Lady Michelle Obama in a forum for promising girls in Washington, D.C. public schools in March 2009.
Dunwoody officially retired from the U.S. Army after 37 years on August 15, 2012.[1]
Career firsts[edit]




Dunwoody is pinned with her four stars by Army Chief of Staff General Casey and her husband Craig Brotchie.


Among her notable firsts, she became the first woman to command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division in 1992. She became Fort Bragg's first female general officer in 2000.

First Female Four-Star General




General Ann Dunwoody is the former commanding general of one of the Army’s largest commands, the U.S. Army Materiel Command. She is the first woman in U.S. military history to achieve a four-star officer rank, and U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno called her “quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had.” During her nearly four decades in the military, she led many divisions at home and abroad, commanding at every level, and she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since WWII. Spunky, tomboyish, and a straight shooter, she is exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau and addresses peak performance, leading change, visioning, and logistics. She offers strategic insights for managing large organizations, preparing them for the future, ensuring their lasting relevancy, and evaluating where to invest – as well as divest.
U.S. Army Career. Dunwoody led the transformation of the Army’s logistics organizations. She was responsible for research and development, installation and contingency contracting, foreign military sales, supply chain management, and more. She also oversaw all of the depots that supported supply, maintenance, manufacturing, and ammunitions. AMC had more than 69,000 employees and presence in all 50 states and 145 countries, and Dunwoody managed a budget of $60 billion dollars and was responsible for oversight of approximately $70 billion in service contracts. She also led the Army’s global supply chain in support of Iraq and Afghanistan and contingency operations in Haiti, Pakistan, and Japan.
Among Dunwoody’s many accomplishments came several career and military firsts. In addition to becoming the first woman in U.S. military history to achieve the rank of four-star general, she was the first woman to command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division in 1992, and she became Fort Bragg’s first female general officer in 2000. Dunwoody was also the first woman to command the Combined Arms Support Command. In 2005, Dunwoody became the Army’s top-ranking female when she received the promotion to lieutenant general (three stars) and became the Army’s deputy chief of staff, G-4 (logistics). She received her fourth star in 2008.

Speech Topics



                    Leadership and Peak Performance.
                  

General Ann Dunwoody shares her field-tested insights and lessons on leadership and driving peak performance. She believes that good leadership is in finding your passion and helps her audience understand how to tap into that desire and ability to inspire. Leadership is about communicating a vision and earning buy-in from your subordinates – not directives and authority. Dunwoody shares the unique perspective of the military’s most successful woman ever – from her experience in a traditionally male-dominated world.



                    Leading Change.
                  

As the first female four-star general, Ann Dunwoody knows a thing or two about leadership and leading change in an organization. She was first commissioned as a part of the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) but then had to manage the integration of women into the army as WAC was dismantled. She also successfully redesigned and realigned her supply management division to keep the unit from being absorbed. In this presentation, Dunwoody outlines her strategies for successfully leading change, which stem from the belief that you cannot direct change, you have to inspire it by communicating your vision, getting key players to participate, and achieving buy-in from those involved. While most people are averse to change (especially in the military!), General Dunwoody lived by retired four-star General Eric Shinseki’s quote: “If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance even less,” and she gives her audience practical advice for achieving the same great feats that she did.



                    Visioning.
                  

Ann Dunwoody outlines how to create a successful vision for an organization that generates buy-in and inspires the action necessary for success. She shares that the key is getting all goals and plans on a single sheet of paper so that people can easily understand how their actions contribute to the overall mission. Leaders must then bring all of the affected parties together to ensure that everyone (and everyone’s division or department) is included in the vision. The helps each individual person feels ownership of the success or failure of the vision. In this presentation, she offers her approach to visioning and gives her audience practical takeaways for making it happen at their own organizations.



                    Logistics.
                  

General Ann Dunwoody spent her entire military career managing logistics, and she shares her tips of the trade in this rare chance to pick the brain of the woman who successfully managed the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. forces since WWII. Citing the 70% of procurement costs are in the logistics, she tackles the complexities of making sure that our country’s troops are ready and well-supplied in the field, as she commanded 69,000 employees with a presence in all 50 states and 145 countries.

My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father, my brother, my sister, my niece and my husband are all veterans of this country’s wars. My father is a veteran of three wars and is one of the 25 million veterans living today who served the nation with such incredible courage.While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill then the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

Lieutenant General Ann Dunwoody"I have never considered myself anything but a Soldier.

Lieutenant General Ann Dunwoody"There is no one more surprised than I — except, of course, my husband. You know what they say, 'Behind every successful woman there is an astonished man.'

So it really doesn’t surprise me she was the first woman selected for four stars.” Dunwoody's Father, retired Brigadier General Harold H.

Lettris






Lettris is a curious tetris-clone game where all the bricks have the same square shape but different content. Each square carries a letter. To make squares disappear and save space for other squares you have to assemble English words (left, right, up, down) from the falling squares. 



boggle
Boggle gives you 3 minutes to find as many words (3 letters or more) as you can in a grid of 16 letters. You can also try the grid of 16 letters. Letters must be adjacent and longer words score better. See if you can get into the grid Hall of Fame !

DunwoodyBorn:  January 14, 1953 Fort Belvoir, VirginiaMarried: Colonel Craig Brotchie,, 2008 USAF (retired)Children: No children but have a dog named BarneyIn 2008 became the first woman to reach four-star status in the U.S. Army.Brief Military HistoryIn 1975, Gen. Dunwoody graduated from State University of New York College at Cortland with a degree in physical education and was direct commissioned into the Women's Army Corps. Gen. Dunwoody's first assignment was as a platoon leader with the 226th Maintenance Company, 100th Supply and Services Battalion, Fort Sill, Oklahoma.37 years in Quartermaster Corps. She retired in 2012Trait TheoryGen Dunwoody has a long family history of U.S. military service – going back five generationsHer great-grandfather, Brigadier General Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody, an 1862 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy,was the Chief Signal Officer in Cuba from 1898 to 1901.Her father retired from the U.S. Army as a Brigadier General in 1973. Brigadier General Dunwoody is a highly decorated veteran of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.General Ann E. Dunwoody"While I joined the Army right out of college, I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two-year commitment, but it wasn’t too long before I realized that there are no other shoes [boots] I would rather fill than the ones I am wearing right now. As a soldier you can continually serve. It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world."Transformational LeaderExtends influence beyond the chain of commandGen. Dunwoody is a role model for many female in the military. After her promotion she stated "I've heard from moms and dads that see this promotion as a beacon of hope for their own daughters, and an affirmation that anything is possible through hard work and commitment," "Lieutenant General Dunwoody's nomination not only underscores her significant contributions and success throughout 33 years of service, but also shows the level of possible opportunity in our Army's diverse, quality, all-volunteer force. Our nation will continue to benefit from Lieutenant General Dunwoody's leadership as the Army continues to build strength from our diversity." General George W. Casey, Chief of Staff of the ArmyBehavior TheoryHumility "I have never considered myself anything but a Soldier. I recognize that with this selection, some will view me as a trailblazer, but it's important that we remember the generations of women, whose dedication, commitment and quality of service helped open the doors of opportunity for us today." High Concern for fellow soldiersDunwoody, along with George W. Casey, Jr. were very avid in pushing for a decrease in sexual assault within the Army. Dunwoody believes that the Army sets an example for the rest of the world, and that they have a long way to go in order to significantly decrease sexual assault, but they are making progressSituational Leadership During her career, Dunwoody managed the largest global logistics command in Army history (69,000 military and civilians, located in all 50 states and more than 140 countries). Along with that she managed a budget of $60 billion and was responsible for oversight of approximately $70 billion in service contracts. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno claimed that Dunwoody was "quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had”She deployed for Desert Shield and Desert Storm with the 82d as the Division Parachute Officer from September 1990 to March 1991, and in 2001, as CG, 1st COSCOM she deployed the Log Task Force in support of OEF1 and stood up the Joint Logistics Command in Uzbekistan in support of CJTF-180. As CG, SDDC, she supported the largest deployment and redeployment of U.S. Forces since WWII. AgendaBackground and military history on Ann E.
