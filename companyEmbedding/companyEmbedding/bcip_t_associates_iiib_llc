        		General description
				
				

        BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate) is the AP (alkaline phosphatase)-substrate which after dephosphorylation reacts further to give a dark-blue indigo dye as an oxidation product. INT (iodonitrotetrazolium) is the oxidant producing a red dye. The reaction product has a reddish-brown color and is insoluble in water.
