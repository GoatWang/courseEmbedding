   COMING SOON!
John Michael’s note cards are currently created with care and in very low production runs. Each card is printed on high quality card stock (It took John Michael over two years to find and secure the papers that are used) – once printed and cut to size each card is hand folded with utmost care to deliver a product of highest quality.
From a growing collection of hundreds of different designs, each card bears the colorful, rich heritage of the unit on the front of the card and on the back is the history and interpretation of the insignia that appears on the front.
Photographic cards are selected from John Michael’s extensive portfolio of outstanding photographs with the consideration of providing a background or history depicted by the photograph.

Exclusive KerActive protein “hugs” the hair to help repair damage.



Conditioners and safflower oleosomes deliver rich plant oils to replenish lost moisture and nutrients.



KerActive penetrates the hair shaft to help rebuild, while safflower oleosomes deliver moisture and seal the cuticle.



The result is stronger, healthier hair with long-lasting hydration and shine.










Humble Beginnings
In 1980, two friends were inspired to create a company that would offer luxurious hair care at an affordable price. With just $700, John Paul DeJoria and Paul Mitchell launched a revolutionary hair care system featuring three products. More than 35 years later, Paul Mitchell® offers more than 75 products that are available around the world.
