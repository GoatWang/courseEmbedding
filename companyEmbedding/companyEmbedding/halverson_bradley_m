Biography



    The Board elected Mr. Bradley M. Halverson as Group President and CFO of the Company with responsibility for Corporate Services, effective January 1, 2013. Mr. Halverson, 55, was elected to his current position as a Vice President of the Company in 2010 with responsibility for the Finance Services Division. As Vice President, his primary responsibilities included management and oversight of the accounting, finance, treasury and tax functions of the Company, reporting directly to Mr. Rapp. During his 25 year career, Mr. Halverson has held a number of positions with increasing responsibilities. After gaining auditing and tax experience with the former Price Waterhouse firm (now PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP), he joined the Company in 1988 as an accountant. In 1993, he moved to Geneva, Switzerland, as a strategy and planning consultant with Caterpillar Overseas, S.A. (COSA), and in 1995 was named the Controller for COSA with responsibility for financial reporting in EAME. Following Mr. Halverson's return to the United States in 1996, he became the General Accounting & Finance Systems Manager, and from 1998 to 2002, he was the Business Resource Manager for the Company's Engine Division. He was the Corporate Business Development Manager before becoming the Company's Corporate Controller in December 2004, a position which he held until his election as Vice President for the Finance Services Division.
