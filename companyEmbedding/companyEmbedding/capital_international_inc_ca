Capital International, Inc. Key Developments

Haldiram Reportedly In Talks With PEs To Sell Stake May Raise $200 Million
May 18 16
Haldiram Foods International Pvt. Ltd has held initial talks with top-tier private equity funds for a possible $200 million, or INR 13 billion, financing round, people close to the development said. Capital International, Inc., General Atlantic LLC, TA Associates Management, L.P., Everstone Capital Management and WestBridge Capital Partners LLC are among those who have made overtures to pick up a minority stake in the business, combining Nagpur and Delhi branches of the company. The deal, if and when it goes through, is likely to value the snack manufacturer at around $1 billion, or INR 67 billion, sources said. The transaction is likely to have a large secondary component wherein existing and new investors will exchange shares for capital, but money won't come into the company. TOI could not reach the promoters of Haldiram's but DK Surana, an investment banker who has represented the company in the past, said a deal like this was not in the making as the business is cash-rich and profitable. The structuring of a potential deal was still to be worked out with investors preferring to plough funds into a combined entity. The capital infusion could be a mix of fresh equity allotment and a secondary share purchase. Most PE funds declined to comment or did not respond to queries. Capital International could not be reached immediately.

 Team Products International, Inc.
Parsippany, New Jersey
has been acquired by
H.I.G. Capital
Miami, Florida


Capital Alliance Corporation initiated this transaction and assisted in its closing.









      Team Products International, Inc.    

The Selling Company: Team Products is a leading supplier of consumer electronic products to over 500 national and regional mass marketing retail chains and stores including Wal-Mart and Target.
Why the Company Was Sold: The shareholders, largely in their 40s, desired to obtain a measure of liquidity to reduce their risk concentration. In addition, they desired human and monetary growth capital to expand their very fast growing business.
Capital Alliance’s Performance: Mining its proprietary database, an acquirer with a long-term relationship to Capital Alliance was identified and introduced to Team Products. Capital Alliance Corporation received interest from 30 strategic and financial acquirers, as well as four offers within six weeks of going to the market.
Terms of the Transaction: The selling shareholders received cash for 70% of the company, significant earn-out opportunities and retained 30% of the company.
The Acquiring Company: HIG Capital is a large private equity investor, managing companies with over $5 billion in total revenues. With HIG’s participation, the company more than doubled its revenues within 18 months of closing.
