I met Ted Gray one morning at the Holland Hotel in Alpine while eating breakfast with my family. He aked if we minded an old man sitting with us and telling a story of West Texas and of course we were more than happy to listen. He told us stories for probably two hours and when he was done he made mention of a couple of books that he had written. When we went to the book store down the street the lady said that old Ted was the best salesman that he had for his books. The next morning at breakfast he showed up again and offered to sign both books which I wasted no time going to our room to get. He signed both to my family and we spent another couple of hours mesmerized by more of his stories.
 Mr. Gray was the probably the most fascinating person that I'd ever met. It wasn't until after I read his books that I realized how much of an influence that he had in Alpine and almost all of Brewster County. He, in his own way, made me decide that the best things in life are made by your own choice and that hard work pays off. I will forever miss the stranger that took the time to share a bit of his life to shape mine.

During my last trip to the Big Bend, I met Ted Gray in Alpine.  He was an interesting successful gentleman who shared his time and stories w my friend and I who came for the Annual Poetry Gathering.  He is very much missed.

Ted Gray Was Managing Large Outfit By The Time He Was 17 

















































  

          GOOD FRIENDS and early mentors
          served West Texas cowman Ted Gray well over the years. He took their
          counsel and examples to heart, and the one-time dollar-a-day cowboy
          gradually put together a large ranching, land and oil business.

Ted Gray Was Managing Large
          Outfit By The Time He Was 17

By Colleen Schreiber
ALPINE  Ted Gray came west with a truckload of mules. It was
          1939 and he was only 16 years old.
It was his mentor, Jerome Dees, who got Gray interested in West
          Texas and ranching. Dees had worked on many of the large cow outfits
          in West Texas, like the West-Pyle Cattle Co. and the Figure 2s. Gray
          had listened to Dees' stories about West Texas and how there was
          opportunity in that big country for anyone who was willing to work
          hard.
F.L. Shawver was another mentor. Both he and Dees were ranchers in
          Jack County, and Dees had a ranch in Llano County as well. Those two
          men guided Gray in his early years. From them Gray says he learned
          "thrift."
He also received much encouragement.
"Mr. Dees told me that everyone was responsible for oneself
          and that I should try and work to better myself so that I would have
          something later in life."
Gray, born in Jacksboro in 1923, was the 11th
          child in a family of 12. J.E. Gray Sr. was a stock farmer, as were so
          many of that era. Gray remembers well the hard times brought on by the
          Great Depression. His father essentially went broke during that time.
Gray himself was drawing a paycheck at the tender age of 12. He
          also trapped coons and sold the hides. He worked hard to get what he
          wanted. When he had enough money saved up, he bought two pigs. He
          raised many litters of pigs and when a trader came through with a
          truckload of ponies he sold his pigs and bought his first horse.
"I was a born cowboy," Gray says. "I didnt like
          farming. Thats another reason why I wanted to get away."
When Gray was 15, he sold his two cows and calves for $35 a pair
          and his horse for $30 and headed to Colorado. He had heard about the
          70 Ranch outside of Greeley and hoped to hire on there. He did at $2 a
          day. It was the most money hed ever seen.
Gray stayed in Colorado through the summer and then came back to
          Jack County, but not for long. Dees stories of West Texas kept
          coming back to him. When he heard about a mule trader who was hauling
          a load of mules to Alpine, he grabbed his saddle and bedroll and
          jumped on board.
When he left for West Texas, he left his life in North Texas behind
          forever. He took with him his work ethic and his honesty. He started
          out working on various ranches around Alpine, Marfa and Fort Davis for
          $30 a month.
Before he was 20, young Gray had not only worked for many of the
          big outfits he had dreamed about, but he had managed some of them as
          well. Gray's longest stint was with the Kokernot 06 Ranch. He worked
          there for 23 years and managed it for much of that time.
"I can remember when we could drive down the street of Alpine
          and pick up five or six cowboys who were eager to work. You didnt
          ask what the pay was, how long youd be gone or where you were
          going. You were just glad to get on somewhere."
Gray was a good all-around hand.
"I expect I was a little better than a green hand," he
          remarks. "I learned from doing it. Thats the way anyone
          learns."
When he was 17, he was offered a job managing Nine Points Mesa
          Ranch in south Brewster County.
"I was willing to work," Gray says. "Perhaps I had
          the right diplomacy."
Next he went to the Bull Weatherford Ranch in south Presidio
          County. He worked at the 02s twice. The 02s encompassed some 400
          sections and ran 7000 cattle. The Lykes Brothers bought the ranch in
          the 1940s.
Though he enjoyed those experiences and learned from each of them,
          Gray thought the Kokernot Ranch was the place he wanted and needed to
          be. He had heard good things about the ranch. They were conservative
          in their ranching approach and they treated their men fairly.
He stayed with the 06 for a few years and learned a great deal but
          he desired more. When he was 28, an opportunity arose with Cap Yates.
          Yates had been watching from afar and liked what he saw. He knew the
          young man had potential and he needed some help on his operation, so
          he offered Gray half interest in his livestock and Glass Mountain
          Ranch between Alpine and Marathon.
Gray was young and had little capital. He had made some friends,
          however, including some who were well connected. He was able to borrow
          $40,000 from the bank in Fort Davis, thanks in large part to one such
          friend, Joe Espy.
"He took me to the bank and told them to make me a note for
          what I needed," Gray recalls. "Later Mr. Espy made me a
          director in the bank. I was just a kid. I wouldnt have made it
          without friends like him."
Gray knew it was a risky venture, but he wanted to try so he left
          the 06. He worked hard, but the timing was not the best. When he went
          into the partnership the Korean War and just begun. When the war was
          over, the bottom dropped out of the cattle market. Gray didnt see
          how he would ever be able to pay off his debt, so he decided to get
          out before he was in too deep.
Luckily, the Kokernots were needing a manager. Gray had worked hard
          for him before and Kokernot believed in his ability so he offered Gray
          the job. Gray accepted.
Kokernot gave him free reign to run the operation as he saw fit. He
          made many improvements in those early years. He studied every phase of
          the ranching business forward and backward.
"To be a good cowman takes lots of experience," Gray
          says. "You cant read it in a book, you cant go to college
          and learn it. The man who is most successful is the one who has made
          the most tracks on his operation."
When Gray first arrived in West Texas, many ranches were still
          running two and three year-old steers. The Kokernot was no different.
          Hereford cattle were the norm in West Texas and the Kokernot followed
          that tradition. Gray, however, worked hard to raise the best.
"My friend Dees raised the best cattle I ever saw. They fit
          the eye," he says. "He knew cattle; he was a cowman."
He bought bulls from Dees for many years and he bought a good many
          from Foy Proctor as well.
"Find someone who raises cattle like you like," Gray
          recommends. "Contract their bull calves every year, and then
          eventually your cattle will begin to look the same."
The Kokernot had seven camps. Each camp ran a thousand or so cows,
          depending on the quality of the land and the acreage. Two or three men
          stayed at each camp.
When Gray took over as manager, he used a man a time or two on the
          "works", and if he proved to be a good hand, the cowboy was
          hired as a steady.
The lower Kokernot country was used for breeding and calving. When
          the calves were cut off their mothers they drove them to the mountain
          country to grow out.
"Livestock did better in the mountain country," Gray
          says, "because the grass was much stronger. Steers weighed 30 to
          40 pounds more compared to those run in the flats."
The wagon went out for the spring work about the first of April
          depending on the calf crop, sometimes a little later.
"In those days we had to get out ahead of the screwworms, and
          generally anything that you branded or marked after the 10th
          of May would get worms," Gray explained.
The fall work generally began the first of October. Shipping took
          40 to 45 days. The lower end of the ranch was shipped out at Hovey
          while the cattle in the mountains generally went to the Southern
          Pacific and Santa Fe pens at Alpine. It wasnt unusual to have 3500
          head in the pens there at one time, Gray says.
There werent many feedlots then, certainly none in the
          Panhandle, so the cattle were shipped to the Cornbelt or to Los
          Angeles. Many of the big steers went west.
"California was a building population, and they wanted red
          meat to feed their families," Gray says. "They didnt
          demand quality beef, so the plainer cattle went west."
The train came out of Presidio. Cattle had to be loaded out by
          midnight for the train to meet another one in San Angelo that was
          going north.
"If we fooled around, it cost us another day of feed and water
          and rest between there and the Cornbelt," Gray remembers.
"We could ship three days a week if animals were going north
          or almost any day of the week going west on the Southern
          Pacific."
Gray has shipped cattle as far north as Minnesota, a trip which
          took seven days. Most of the cattle went to Indiana. That trip took
          six days. Sometimes they would have to feed once and rest twice.
"Our cattle were healthy, and they generally got there in good
          condition, but it was expensive by train. Shipping by truck was a big
          advancement," Gray says. "We could get the cattle there in
          two days and a night."
He remembers one particular incident at the Santa Fe pens.
"We would load one car and set the brake and it would roll off
          a ways and then lock," Gray explains. "This particular time,
          whoever set the brake on the first car didnt set it too well. We
          rolled that second car down and then I hear, look yonder. There go
          our cattle. The two cars were on the main line, rolling down the
          tracks. I figured they would jump the track, but the railroad engineer
          said they would roll clear to Stockton (Fort Stockton), because it's
          downhill all the way.
"The engine was at the depot, so the engineer got down there
          and got on the engine. I thought it was the Wabash Cannonball. He was
          rocking them rails trying to catch up. The two cars were down about 25
          miles before the engine caught up with them and hooked on."
The Kokernots, Gray says, were frugal operators. They never spent
          much money. They fed some, but not often and never very much.
"We had some awful good years," Gray recalls. "I can
          remember the first time calves brought $100. I cut everything that
          would dollar out.
"We had a good bottom line figure most years  through the
          50s was pretty slim, but we never had a red figure," he says.
          "We made a little money all the time."
The Kokernot, Gray says, was never known for having good horses.
"I bought the first good stallion the ranch ever owned. He was
          a yearling, and I gave $1400 for him and I thought I might get fired
          when I got home," Gray recalls. "By the time I left the
          Kokernot for good, they had a pretty good remuda."
          Gray had grown up doing things the old way, and often it took him
          awhile to get used to a new way of doing business. His first
          experience loading horses in a horse trailer was not a good one.
"We didnt do much gasoline business," Gray remarks.
          "I moved my remuda with $1.50-a-day man."
Gray says he wore out a lot of horses and a lot of ropes during the
          screwworm days, particularly in 1941, his first year at the Kokernot.
"It rained a lot that year, and the worms were particularly
          bad. When the hornflies got to bothering the cattle, they would run
          into the catclaw for protection. When the cattle got scratched up we
          had lots of worm problems."
Gray closely followed what was being done to eradicate the
          screwworm. He believed it would work, but he knew raising the
          necessary funds would be a challenge. He was appointed chairman for
          his county.
"We raised a good bit of money in the tri-county area, but I
          told Dolph (Gov. Dolph Briscoe) that we wouldnt release the money
          until we got some flies," Gray said.
"They were tracking the flies and they were moving 10 miles a
          day out of Mexico. When we got the first flies, they were right away a
          tremendous help, so we got busy raising more money."
While managing the 06, Gray began buying calves and yearlings off
          neighboring ranches and others in the area. It was a hard business to
          break into, he says, because he hadnt grown up in the area and few
          people knew anything about the young man. He had never been one to
          talk about where he came from.
Eventually, however, he established a reputation for being fair and
          honest, and his trading business grew.
"I burned the telephone up," Gray says. "I read
          every paper I could get my hands on, and I stayed in touch with those
          who knew the markets. Thats how I knew how to price my cattle. I
          talked to Joe Espy at least twice a week. I suspect he knew every
          packer buyer in California."
As his capital increased, so did his desire to run his own cattle
          again. He approached Herbert Kokernot about the possibility, and he
          generously agreed to let him run 100 to 150 cows on the ranch. He
          bought 100 cows from John Honeycutt of Sierra Blanca for $125 a pair.
When Gray first came to West Texas, he says, grass was stirrup high
          in a lot of the country. It was some of the finest country hed ever
          seen. The drouth of the 1950s changed that image.
The 06, like many, soon ran out of feed and almost out of water.
          Every year he sold off the oldest cows. His own small herd was
          suffering as well. He knew he couldnt afford to feed them and there
          was simply nothing left for them to eat, so that left him with the
          only other option  sell.
He told Kokernot of his plan.
"Mr. Kokernot told me that if I sold my cows, as cheap as they
          were, I would never be able to pay off my debt. He told me I could
          carry my cattle anywhere on his ranch where there might be more grass.
          I only had 150 cows; he had 7000. He was just that kind of man,"
          Gray says.
That's how he made it through the drouth. After the drouth broke,
          Gray began leasing country of his own. First he leased the 29,000-acre
          Henderson ranch. Gray had handled their cattle for several years. He
          signed a 10-year lease and bought the cattle. Later he had an
          opportunity to buy the ranch. In all he operated what he called the
          "flat country" for 20-some years.
Gray also leased the 32,000-acre Nevill ranch south of Alpine. He
          bought the cows with that ranch as well and operated it for 10 years.
          He partnered with Bruce Pearson on the Saddleback Ranch, a yearling
          operation, and he leased the Maupin country consisting of 32,000 acres
          near Sierra Blanca. Later, after the Kokernot split up, he leased the
          Limpia country for many years.
Those were only a few of the leases he took on. For a while Gray
          and the Kokernot family had all the country from Balmorhea to Alpine
          under their control. The young man who had walked to school barefoot
          with ice on the ground had come a long way. He had a dream and he
          worked to make that dream come true.
"Altogether it was sure turning the crank for an old
          cowboy," Gray admits. "It got to the point where a salary
          was something I sure didnt need. I was paying more taxes a day than
          I was drawing in a month.
"I always thought I was a Republican," he adds, "but
          sometimes when the Democrats were in power I made more money. Really,
          I think rainfall had more to do with the good years than anything
          else. Without grass you cant ranch."
Ranching was not the only thing Gray did well. He made some wise
          trades in the land business. Worth Evans also introduced him to the
          stock market, and Clayton Williams taught him about the oil business.
"Ive always tried to associate myself with those who have
          been successful. You dont want to follow an empty wagon," he
          points out.
Ranching, however, was his first love and remains so today.
"I went through a lot of ups and downs in the cattle business,
          but its what I really enjoyed."
Gray has had nearly every bone in his body broken, many more than
          once, because being a good cowboy, he says, meant taking some risk
          horseback. Gray retired for good about 10 years ago.
He and his wife, Addie, have been married for almost 53 years.
          Together theyve traveled the world, but West Texas has always been
          home.
The couple raised two sons, Ted Jr. and Andy. Gray taught them
          everything he knew and both were fine hands, he says, but in the end,
          after receiving a good education, both chose other careers.

UBS Financial Services, Inc.


                  UBS Financial Services' asset allocations are based on a proprietary methodology. In developing those allocations, UBS considers asset class risk and return results that are based on estimated forward-looking return and risk assumptions, as measured by standard deviation (“capital market assumptions”), which are based on UBS proprietary research. The development process includes a review of a variety of factors, including the return, risk, correlations and historical performance of various asset classes, inflation and risk premium. The process assumes a situation where the supply and demand for investments is in balance and in which expected returns of all asset classes are a reflection of their expected risk and correlations regardless of timeframe. These capital market assumptions do not assume any particular investment time horizon. UBS periodically reviews the economic or market conditions or other general investment considerations that it believes may impact the capital market assumptions. The capital market assumptions may change from time to time at the discretion of UBS.
