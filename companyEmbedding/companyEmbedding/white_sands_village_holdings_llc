Locations of industrial sand mines and processing plants in Wisconsin
Industrial sand for use in the petroleum industry has been produced in Wisconsin for over 40 years. However, the demand for industrial sand has increased exponentially in the past few years. Wisconsin has mining, processing and transportation facilities associated with industrial sand. Some facilities have a combination of these activities.
Current site totals and spreadsheet
Current mining operations are primarily located in West Central Wisconsin, but there are also facilities in Burnett, Green Lake, Outagamie and Waupaca Counties. The following table and the interactive map contain information that is current as of May 23, 2016.


Total Number of Industrial Sand Facilities (Mines, Processing & Rail Loading)
128


Number of Active Facilities
92


Number of Inactive Facilities
32


Number of Facilities Reclaimed/In Process of Final Reclamation
4


Download a spreadsheet with information about sand mining facilities in Wisconsin [XLSX].
Interactive map
This interactive map shows information about both active and inactive industrial sand mines and processing plants in Wisconsin, as well as facilities that have been reclaimed or are in the process of final reclamation. It also shows locations of rail and transportation sites. Due to the complicated ownership of some parcels, the map identifies the mining site operator rather than the property owner. This format provides a single point of contact with the mining companies responsible for the operations.
To view information on a site, click on a pinpoint. You may need to zoom in on the map to differentiate between pinpoints.
