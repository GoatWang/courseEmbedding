EIG Global Energy Partners Key Developments

Bolognesi Participações Negotiates Sale Of Thermoelectric Plants To Prumo
Jun 6 17
Bolognesi Participações S.A. is reported to be in advanced negotiations with  Prumo Logística S.A., controlled by EIG Global Energy Partners  for the sale of its Novo Tempo thermoelectric plant in Pernambuco. The sale will include the 1.2 GW plant and the liquefied natural gas regasification terminal that is also part of the project.

Fosun, Others Reportedly Eye Australia's Origin Energy Gas Assets 
May 26 17
Fosun International Limited (SEHK:656) Origin Energy Limited (ASX:ORG) has drawn interest from at least five potential bidders, including Fosun International Limited (SEHK:656), for AUD 2.0 billion worth of oil and gas assets it aims to spin off, sources said. Beach Energy Limited (ASX:BPT) is one of the interested parties and could be the bidder to beat, as it is the biggest of the producers in the fray, the sources said. Beach declined to comment on whether it was bidding, but the company has said in presentations it is reviewing several "inorganic growth" opportunities. Questus Energy LLC is also in the running, sources say. Origin declined to comment beyond what it has announced. Fosun and Questus did not respond to requests for comment. Senex Energy Limited (ASX:SXY) is expected to work with its stakeholder, EIG Global Energy Partners. KKR & Co. L.P. (NYSE:KKR) is seen lining up with AWE Limited (ASX:AWE), two bankers said. All four firms declined to comment. Lone Star Funds declined to comment on whether it was looking at Lattice. All the sources did not want to be named as the process is confidential. Pathfinder Energy Pty Ltd told Reuters it is not bidding. While Origin has said it would prefer an IPO.


Origin Energy Nears Decision On Lattice Energy's Fate
May 23 17
Origin Energy Limited (ASX:ORG) nears crunch time for decisions on the fate of its Lattice Energy oil and gas division, new players are emerging that are spicing up the line-up of suitors competing against the IPO option. Beach Energy Limited (ASX:BPT) is widely seen as the player most likely to bid up for Lattice. AWE Limited (ASX:AWE) and KKR & Co. L.P. (NYSE:KKR) have also reportedly formed a partnership with its own design on the portfolio. Sensex already has EIG Global Energy Partners, but is still looking around for another co-bidder given its interest is focused only on the assets that would suit its east coast gas focus.

ENERGY FUNDS

EIG's energy funds focus on providing hybrid debt and structured equity financing solutions to energy projects and companies on a global basis. The funds target directly negotiated private transactions with mid- and large-cap energy companies and projects with an emphasis on transactions underpinned by hard assets, such as proven oil and gas reserves, pipelines, gathering systems, processing facilities, liquefied natural gas terminals, power plants, alternative energy and similar opportunities. The funds have the ability to invest in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars.






HARBOUR ENERGY LTD

EIG and The Noble Group (“Noble”), have joined together to form a new company, Harbour Energy, Ltd. (“Harbour”), which focuses on making control and near control investments in upstream and midstream companies, primarily outside of the United States. Harbour operates at the confluence of three major trends in the global energy industry – new sources of supply, changing trade patterns and changes in the commodity trading industry causing traditional financial intermediaries to exit and independent physical energy trading houses to gain in importance. Harbour is entirely managed by EIG but benefits from Noble’s industry leading expertise in energy trading, logistics and risk management.






CREDIT/DIRECT LENDING

Since 2001, EIG's credit/direct lending vehicles have targeted higher credit quality project finance instruments. These vehicles provide senior and high yield loans to energy and infrastructure projects and companies on a global basis. EIG believes that an ability to make senior, longer duration investments provides a competitive advantage, given that many energy and infrastructure assets have long useful lives and often are supported by stable, contracted cash flows.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
