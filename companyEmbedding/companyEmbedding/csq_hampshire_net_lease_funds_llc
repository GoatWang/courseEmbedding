What is a Triple Net Lease?


The terms “Triple Net Lease”, Triple Net Leased “Triple-Net,” “NNN,” “Net Lease,” “Net-Net- Net” are
interchangeable. The definition of a Triple Net Lease (NNN) requires the tenant to pay all insurance, maintenance,
and taxes. The tenant is responsible for all normal expenses of ownership, leaving the owner free of day-to- day
management responsibility.


Most commercial property NNN leases are often between 10-25 years and include cost-of- living rent increases.
Rental payment continues for the full term of a NNN lease. This makes the credit rating of the tenant very important.




 Get 1031 List




NNN-1031 Investment Advantages


Here are a few benefits of an investment grade (defined as having a BBB- or better credit rating by at least one of the rating agencies) triple NNN investment property:


	
	1. Net leased properties can relieve owners from day-to- day management issues.

	2. Steady income-stream potential paid by an investment grade corporate tenant.

	3. A long-term lease to a corporate tenant with credit rating makes it easier to get a mortgage loan at favorable rates.

	4. NNN properties may have high residual values because they are most often built for retailers who have researched the market to find high density, middle income areas with attractive traffic patterns.




 Get 1031 List




Why Triple-Net- Leases should align tenant and landlord interest.


Many regional and national companies choose to lease their business property. Leasing the property gives the
occupying companies the ability to control their physical environment without the financial commitment of
ownership. By leasing the property, companies free up their corporate funds for business expansion and
improvement. A Triple-Net lease gives the companies control over the property they occupy without the capital
commitment of ownership.


Most commercial property NNN leases are often between 10-25 years and include cost-of- living rent increases.
Rental payment continues for the full term of a NNN lease. This makes the credit rating of the tenant very important.




1031 Exchange NNN-DST Properties


Some Triple Net investment properties are available as a Tenancy in Common (DST) interest.  NNN-DST properties
can be single-tenant, industrial, or retail properties with long-term leases to corporate tenants, however it is not
uncommon to find Triple Net Lease, NNN investment multi-tenant office property.

A potential investor could perhaps exchange into a DST 1031 exchange triple net property that requires little day-to-
day involvement by the investor. These undivided fractional interests provide an alternative to sole ownership of real
estate by allowing taxpayers to purchase interests in larger, commercial quality properties that are professionally
managed.




Sole Ownership NNN vs. Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST)


Since the mid-1990s, 1031 exchange investors have reinvested their equity into Triple Net Lease (NNN) investment properties structured as Tenancy-in- Common (DST). If you are an accredited and pre-qualified investor searching for a Triple Net Lease (NNN) property you may consider the following potential advantages of investing in a Triple Net Lease (NNN) property owned Delaware Statutory Trusts: (see 1031 Tenant in Common Pitfalls)


1. Selection of qualified 1031 exchange (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties. A limited variety of Tenancy-in- Common (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties usually exist for sale in different asset classes and geographical locations.

	2. Diversification. There is always risk, but net proceeds may be split among several (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties and thus invested in several different markets and asset classes, depending on an exchangers equity/debt requirements and the limited number of DST properties available during the Exchangers identification period.

	3. Locating Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) replacement properties. A real estate company typically locates the DST 1031 exchange NNN property, conducts it’s own due diligence research, arranges for the financing, manages the acquisition of the new investment property, sets up the Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) program, and provides the new owners with a management contract with a property management company (affiliated often) to manage the property on a day to day basis.

	4. The exchanger can potentially invest in higher -quality Triple Net Lease (NNN) institutional properties than if you were to invest as an individual.

	Large institutional properties could potentially benefit by having access to more competitive lenders, institutional buyers, and a stronger, more stable tenants base.

	5. The exchanger may benefit from non-recourse debt.

	Investors assume institutional grade, pre-arranged, non-recourse (no personal guarantee) financing. DST-1031 properties are sometimes available that have no debt, or up to a range of 75% leverage. (Note there are usually certain carve out provisions wherein DST owners could be personally liable.

	6. Exchangers may often match or exceed your exchange equity/debt requirements.

	Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) investments offer Triple Net Lease (NNN) investment opportunities ranging from as little as 100K equity up to several million dollars.




Triple Net Lease & DST Master Lease


MASTER LEASE STRUCTURE IN DST SECTION 1031 REPLACEMENT PROPERTY PROGRAMS


1031 Sponsors may offer Delaware Statutory Trusts properties on a Triple Net Master Lease structure to 1031 exchange investors with a Master Lease in place.	
	


WHAT IS A Triple Net (NNN) MASTER LEASE?


In a Master Lease structure, a single entity leases the entire property from the owners in return for a stipulated rent. The owners of the property only have one tenant per the master lease, the “Master Lessee.” The Master Lessee is responsible for the management, maintenance, repairs, leasing, taxes, assessments, and insurance. Most commonly referred to as a “triple net” lease, the structure requires that the owners of the property receive their rent completely and on time from the Master Lessee.

What is a Triple Net Lease?


The terms “Triple Net Lease”, Triple Net Leased “Triple-Net,” “NNN,” “Net Lease,” “Net-Net- Net” are
interchangeable. The definition of a Triple Net Lease (NNN) requires the tenant to pay all insurance, maintenance,
and taxes. The tenant is responsible for all normal expenses of ownership, leaving the owner free of day-to- day
management responsibility.


Most commercial property NNN leases are often between 10-25 years and include cost-of- living rent increases.
Rental payment continues for the full term of a NNN lease. This makes the credit rating of the tenant very important.

NNN-1031 Investment Advantages


Here are a few benefits of an investment grade (defined as having a BBB- or better credit rating by at least one of the rating agencies) triple NNN investment property:


	
	1. Net leased properties can relieve owners from day-to- day management issues.

	2. Steady income-stream potential paid by an investment grade corporate tenant.

	3. A long-term lease to a corporate tenant with credit rating makes it easier to get a mortgage loan at favorable rates.

	4. NNN properties may have high residual values because they are most often built for retailers who have researched the market to find high density, middle income areas with attractive traffic patterns.




 Get 1031 List




Why Triple-Net- Leases should align tenant and landlord interest.


Many regional and national companies choose to lease their business property. Leasing the property gives the
occupying companies the ability to control their physical environment without the financial commitment of
ownership. By leasing the property, companies free up their corporate funds for business expansion and
improvement. A Triple-Net lease gives the companies control over the property they occupy without the capital
commitment of ownership.


Most commercial property NNN leases are often between 10-25 years and include cost-of- living rent increases.
Rental payment continues for the full term of a NNN lease. This makes the credit rating of the tenant very important.




1031 Exchange NNN-DST Properties


Some Triple Net investment properties are available as a Tenancy in Common (DST) interest.  NNN-DST properties
can be single-tenant, industrial, or retail properties with long-term leases to corporate tenants, however it is not
uncommon to find Triple Net Lease, NNN investment multi-tenant office property.

A potential investor could perhaps exchange into a DST 1031 exchange triple net property that requires little day-to-
day involvement by the investor. These undivided fractional interests provide an alternative to sole ownership of real
estate by allowing taxpayers to purchase interests in larger, commercial quality properties that are professionally
managed.




Sole Ownership NNN vs. Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST)


Since the mid-1990s, 1031 exchange investors have reinvested their equity into Triple Net Lease (NNN) investment properties structured as Tenancy-in- Common (DST). If you are an accredited and pre-qualified investor searching for a Triple Net Lease (NNN) property you may consider the following potential advantages of investing in a Triple Net Lease (NNN) property owned Delaware Statutory Trusts: (see 1031 Tenant in Common Pitfalls)


1. Selection of qualified 1031 exchange (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties. A limited variety of Tenancy-in- Common (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties usually exist for sale in different asset classes and geographical locations.

	2. Diversification. There is always risk, but net proceeds may be split among several (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties and thus invested in several different markets and asset classes, depending on an exchangers equity/debt requirements and the limited number of DST properties available during the Exchangers identification period.

	3. Locating Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) replacement properties. A real estate company typically locates the DST 1031 exchange NNN property, conducts it’s own due diligence research, arranges for the financing, manages the acquisition of the new investment property, sets up the Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) program, and provides the new owners with a management contract with a property management company (affiliated often) to manage the property on a day to day basis.

	4. The exchanger can potentially invest in higher -quality Triple Net Lease (NNN) institutional properties than if you were to invest as an individual.

	Large institutional properties could potentially benefit by having access to more competitive lenders, institutional buyers, and a stronger, more stable tenants base.

	5. The exchanger may benefit from non-recourse debt.

	Investors assume institutional grade, pre-arranged, non-recourse (no personal guarantee) financing. DST-1031 properties are sometimes available that have no debt, or up to a range of 75% leverage. (Note there are usually certain carve out provisions wherein DST owners could be personally liable.

	6. Exchangers may often match or exceed your exchange equity/debt requirements.

	Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) investments offer Triple Net Lease (NNN) investment opportunities ranging from as little as 100K equity up to several million dollars.

WHAT IS A Triple Net (NNN) MASTER LEASE?


In a Master Lease structure, a single entity leases the entire property from the owners in return for a stipulated rent. The owners of the property only have one tenant per the master lease, the “Master Lessee.” The Master Lessee is responsible for the management, maintenance, repairs, leasing, taxes, assessments, and insurance. Most commonly referred to as a “triple net” lease, the structure requires that the owners of the property receive their rent completely and on time from the Master Lessee.
