Senior Healthcare Real Estate | LTC Properties




















Active Investors: 
Seniors Housing & Health Care Real Estate
LTC Properties, Inc. (NYSE: LTC) is a real estate investment trust specializing in seniors housing and health care properties. Our portfolio includes more than 200 assisted living, memory care, post-acute / skilled nursing and range-of-care properties in 30 states, with 35 operating partners.
Committed to growth and diversification 
We are committed to building a national presence by expanding our geographic footprint into new states and more urban markets.
Furthermore, we actively diversify our portfolio across property types by implementing highly customized financing solutions. In addition to traditional REIT sale-leaseback of existing assets, we also finance development, renovations and additions. Plus we've very recently rolled out a structured financing solution including preferred equity and mezzanine lending.
We value regional operators
Our management team is dedicated to supporting regional, growth-oriented operating companies. Target deals range from $10 million to $100 million. Specializing in transactions of this size allows us to develop and maintain strong partnerships with regionally based operators.
Our approach: uniquely personalized & collaborative
Because we are a relatively small REIT, we are nimble. Our highly responsive approach encompasses fast due diligence and decision-making, careful attention to transaction details and full engagement with our senior management team.
Most importantly, we combine significant capital resources, industry specific knowledge and sophisticated financial expertise to create truly customized financing solutions.

					Full Description



LTC Properties Inc., incorporated on May 12, 1992, is a healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT). The Company invests in senior housing and healthcare properties through sale-leaseback transactions, mortgage financing and structured finance solutions, including mezzanine lending. The Company invests in various properties, including Skilled nursing facilities (SNF), Assisted living facilities (ALF), Independent living facilities (ILF), Memory care facilities (MC) and Range of care facilities (ROC). SNF provides restorative, rehabilitative and nursing care. Many skilled nursing facilities provide ancillary services that include occupational, speech, physical, respiratory and IV therapies, as well as sub-acute care services, which are paid either by the patient, the patient's family, private health insurance, or through the federal Medicare or state Medicaid programs. ALF serves people requiring assistance with activities of daily living, but do not require the constant supervision skilled nursing facilities provide. ALF Services are usually available round the clock and include personal supervision and assistance with eating, bathing, grooming and administering medication. The facilities provide a combination of housing, supportive services, personalized assistance and healthcare designed to respond to individual needs. ILF, also known as retirement communities or senior apartments, offers a sense of community and numerous levels of service, such as laundry, housekeeping, dining options/meal plans, exercise and wellness programs, transportation, social, cultural and recreational activities, on site security and emergency response programs.The Company's MC offers specialized options for people with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Purpose built, free standing memory care facilities offer an alternative for private pay residents affected by memory loss in comparison to other accommodations that typically have been provided within a unit of an assisted living or skilled nursing facility. These facilities offer care and specialized programming for various conditions relating to memory loss in an environment that is typically smaller in scale and more residential in nature than traditional assisted living facilities. Residents require a higher level of care and more assistance with activities of daily living than in assisted living facilities. ROC provides skilled nursing and any combination of assisted living, independent living and/or memory care services.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
