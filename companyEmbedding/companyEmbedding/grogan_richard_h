TRC Appoints Richard H. Grogan to Board of Directors


03/30/2011

Download this Press Release ()

Chairman of Talisman Management Brings Expertise in Capital and International Markets
LOWELL, MA, Mar 30, 2011 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) --
TRC (NYSE: TRR) announced today that Richard H. Grogan, 57,
Chairman of Talisman Management, Limited, a UK-based investment and
management firm, has been elected to the Company's Board of
Directors. With the addition of Mr. Grogan, TRC's Board is restored
to eight members following the retirement of Jeffrey McNealey in
November 2010 after 25 years of service.

"Rick is an outstanding addition to our Board, and we will benefit
from his long experience in financing, strategy and growth for
companies both in the United States and Europe," said TRC's Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Chris Vincze. "In addition to a
successful track record of acquisitions, investments and
interventions in a variety of companies, Rick also is Chairman of
Talisman Environmental Services and offers a unique perspective on
the management of corporate environmental remediation risk, as well
as the European environmental market."

Mr. Grogan co-founded Talisman Management Limited in 1987 and is a
1975 graduate of Harvard University with an MBA in 1979 from Harvard
Business School. Prior to Talisman, Mr. Grogan was with Bain &
Company serving as a senior partner in the London office. He also has
held positions with Citibank, The Hudson Institute and was Director
of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate. A former
world-champion oarsman, Mr. Grogan lives in London and is also
involved in a variety of civic, cultural and educational activities.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this press release may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as "may," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," or other words of similar import. You should consider statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss TRC's future expectations, contain projections of the Company's future results of operations or of its financial condition, or state other "forward-looking" information. TRC believes that it is important to communicate its future expectations to its investors. However, there may be events in the future that the Company is not able to accurately predict or control and that may cause its actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in its forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the uncertainty of TRC's operational and growth strategies; circumstances which could create large cash outflows, such as contract losses, litigation, uncollectible receivables and income tax assessments; regulatory uncertainty; the availability of funding for government projects; the level of demand for TRC's services; product acceptance; industry-wide competitive factors; the ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel; the availability and adequacy of insurance; and general political or economic conditions. Furthermore, market trends are subject to changes, which could adversely affect future results. See the risk factors and additional discussion in TRC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other factors detailed from time to time in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
