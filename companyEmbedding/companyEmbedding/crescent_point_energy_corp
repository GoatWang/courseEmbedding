PROPOSALS DUE: 12:00 PM(MDT) Wednesday, July 6, 2016















 






 
June 2016





 Crescent Point - Northwest Alberta - Introductory Letter



 Crescent Point - Northwest Alberta - Confidentiality Agreement



 Crescent Point - Northwest Alberta - Confidentiality Agreement (Interactive PDF Form)



 Crescent Point - Northwest Alberta - Marketing Presentation










 






 
2016 NORTHWEST ALBERTA DIVESTITURE
Crescent Point Energy Corp. ("Crescent Point" or the "Company") has initiated a process to divest its interests in three packages (Deep Basin, Peace River Arch and Wabasca) in northwest Alberta (the "Offering") and has retained FirstEnergy Capital Corp. ("FirstEnergy") as its financial advisor. Working interest sales from the Offering averaged 2,618 BOE/d (56% liquids) in April 2016 including 1,044 bbl/d of oil, 410 bbl/d of NGLs and 7.0 MMcf/d of natural gas.

The packages encompass several focused assets including Elmworth, Worsley, Wapiti and Athabasca. Crescent Point’s concentrated position in the Elmworth Dunvegan light oil and liquids rich gas development and the Worsley Charlie Lake horizontal light oil play provides strong cash flow and leverage to increasing oil prices, along with exposure to low risk opportunities. These opportunities primarily include horizontal development and infill drilling, as well as waterflood upside targeting a large, defined light oil resource. At Elmworth, the Company drilled two successful horizontal wells in early 2016 and has identified 83 (52.2 net) remaining horizontal light oil and liquids-rich gas development and infill locations, which pursue an extensive Dunvegan channel system trending throughout the acreage. Reserves have been assigned to 11 (3.3 net) of these locations. At Worsley, Crescent Point has a significant, low risk inventory of 28 (24.9 net) horizontal light oil locations of which 16 (13.4 net) are assigned reserves, targeting several cycles within the Charlie Lake Formation. Waterflood development to increase recovery in the Charlie Lake is supported by offsetting waterflood analogs.

KEY ATTRIBUTES OF THE OFFERING INCLUDE:

Focused assets in the Deep Basin and Peace River Arch areas of northwest Alberta.

145,924 gross (115,151 net) acres of land with ~60% of the acreage undeveloped; includes 3,336 acres of royalty land.


April 2016 W.I. sales of 1,044 bbl/d oil, 410 bbl/d NGLs and 7.0 MMcf/d gas (2,618 BOE/d, 56% liquids).

Light oil and liquids-rich gas production providing strong operating netbacks.
Approximately 89% of working interest production is Crescent Point operated.


Total Proved reserves of 6.4 MMBOE and Proved plus Probable reserves of 9.8 MMBOE (56% liquids).

Conservatively booked with Proved Developed Producing reserves accounting for 55% of Total Proved reserves.
P+P future development capital of nearly $60 MM easily funded from forecast NOI (~49% of NOI over next 5 years).
Extensive inventory of booked opportunities across Crescent Point’s acreage at Elmworth, Worsley and Wapiti.


Deep Basin Package – Large, defined light oil and liquids-rich gas resource in the Dunvegan.

57,920 gross (46,524 net) acres including 24,160 gross (18,838 net) acres undeveloped and 160 acres of royalty land.
April 2016 W.I. sales of 1,879 BOE/d (48% liquids) with ~78% of operated by Crescent Point.
2 Dunvegan horizontal wells drilled at Elmworth in early 2016 targeting light oil achieving superior initial results with the use of slick water fracturing; highly economic with significantly reduced capital costs in the current environment.
        
Low decline (10%/year) liquids-rich Cretaceous gas production at Wapiti.
Several productive Dunvegan channels at Elmworth with good well control; OOIP of 10-20 MMbbl/section.


4.7 MMBOE (44% liquids) of Proved plus Probable reserves attributed to the Package (67% Total Proved).
        
11 (3.3 net) remaining PUD horizontal Dunvegan light oil locations and 4 (3.6 net) Probable recompletions.


72 (48.9 net) unbooked Hz Dunvegan locations at Elmworth and 10 (9.7 net) unbooked Hz Cardium locations at Wapiti.
        
24 (14.3 net) Dunvegan light oil horizontal development (4 wells/section) locations; 22 (8.6 net) infill (6 wells/section).
16 (16 net) Dunvegan liquids-rich gas horizontal development locations (4 wells/section); 10 (10 net) infill locations.


Waterflood potential identified in the Dunvegan ‘B’ Pool, with vertical wells producing at stable, low decline oil rates.
Owned and operated gas gathering, compressor stations and an oil battery, contributing to low operating costs.


Peace River Arch Package – Operated and high W.I. asset at Worsley with low risk Charlie Lake light oil upside.

41,736 gross (25,843 net) acres including 19,360 gross (14,512 net) acres undeveloped and 3,176 acres of royalty land.
April 2016 W.I. sales of 739 BOE/d (73% liquids); low decline production with operating netbacks of $17.77/BOE in 2015.
Charlie Lake resource with several productive and prospective cycles for horizontal drilling throughout the acreage.
5.1 MMBOE (67% liquids) of Proved plus Probable reserves attributed to the Package (64% Total Proved).

Company Overview

From a peer analysis angle, relative underperformance over the last year has improved more recently.


Crescent Point Energy Corp.’s current Price/Book of 0.89 is about median in its peer group.


CPG-US‘s EBITDA-based price multiple implies slower growth than its peers. The market also seems to expect the company’s currently median rates of EBITDA-based return to decline.


CPG-US has relatively low profit margins and median asset efficiency.


Compared with its chosen peers, changes in the company’s annual earnings are better than the changes in its revenue, implying better than median cost control and/or some economies of scale.


Over the last five years, CPG-US‘s return on assets has declined from about median to less than the median among its peers suggesting that the company’s historical competitiveness in operations is slipping away.


Company appears to give away relatively high gross margins to relatively high operating costs suggesting a differentiated product portfolio with low pre-tax margins relative to peers.


CPG-US‘s revenues have grown more slowly than the peer median over the last few years, which combined with the stock price’s relatively low Price/EBITDA ratio suggests substandard growth expectations relative to peers.


The company’s level of capital investment is relatively low and suggests it is milking the business.


CPG-US‘s operating performance may not allow it to raise additional debt.

Leverage & Liquidity
CPG-US would seem to have a hard time raising additional debt.

With debt at 29.23% of its enterprise value compared to an overall benchmark of 25% (Note: The peer median is currently 23.92%), and relatively tight interest coverage level of -3.55x, CPG-US would have a hard time raising much additional debt.


All 3 peers for the company have an outstanding debt balance.

CPG-US has moved to a relatively low liquidity from a Limited Flexibility profile at the recent year-end.

CPG-US‘s interest coverage is its lowest relative to the last five years and compares to a high of 8.71x in 2013.


Though its interest coverage decreased to -3.55x from -2.84x (in 2015), its peer median remained relatively stable during this period at -2.59x.


CPG-US‘s debt-EV has declined 7.63 percentage points from last year’s high but remains above its five-year average debt-EV of 16.83.


The decrease in its debt-EV to 29.23% from 36.87% (in 2015) was also accompanied by a decrease in its peer median during this period to 23.92% from 52.89%.


Relative to peers, debt-EV rose 21.33 percentage points (and is now higher than its peer median). Unlike the peer median, it is also above the 25% leverage benchmark.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Name of product:
Propane (LP) Gas


Hazard:
The recalled propane does not have sufficient levels of odorant to help alert consumers of a gas leak.  Failure to detect leaking gas can present fire, explosion and thermal burn hazards.


Remedy:
RepairReplace 


Recall date:
February 12, 2016


Recall number:
16-101





Consumer Contact:
Crescent Point Energy toll free at 866-421-4266 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. MT, email info@youandpropane.com or online at www.youandpropane.com for more information.




Recall Details


In Conjunction With: 






Description:
This recall involves under-odorized propane gas (LP) delivered to consumers for use in storage tanks or sold at retail locations for use in portable refillable tanks (for use in recreational vehicles, barbeques, stoves and other appliances). LP was also sold to businesses for commercial and industrial use.

 

Remedy: 
Consumers should not attempt to test the propane themselves. Instead, they should immediately contact the retailer, supplier or Crescent Point Energy hotline to arrange for an inspection. If inspection confirms that the propane contains insufficient odorant, Crescent Point Energy will either promptly arrange for appropriate odorization or provide a replacement portable tank. Consumers should have carbon monoxide alarms in homes or other buildings that utilize gas. If consumers do smell even a faint odor of gas or a gas leak, they should immediately leave the building and call 911 or their gas supplier from a neighbor's phone. Do not light a match, turn on a light or switch on anything electrical. 


Incidents/Injuries: 
None reported


Sold At:
Distributed in Arizona, Idaho, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, Wisconsin and Utah, delivered by various companies and sold by retailers between April 2009 and October 2015.


Manufacturer(s): 
Crescent Point Energy Corp., of Canada


Manufactured In: 
Canada


Units: 
About 118,000,000 gallons (U.S.) (additional units sold in Canada)



            Report an Incident Involving this Product          






The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

 Areas - Crescent Point








 









 




 




Areas
When Crescent Point began in 2001, we established a clearly defined strategy to acquire, enhance and develop high-quality, large resource-in-place assets. We’ve focused our acquisition efforts in core areas in southern Saskatchewan. We’re also actively pursuing our strategy in emerging plays, such as the Bakken/Three Forks and the Uinta Basin.
We believe our mix of assets – large oil-in-place conventional plays, large low-risk resource plays, early-stage development plays and high-impact exploration – is a solid foundation for continued growth and results.


To learn more about our assets, roll over each area on the map below.

Williston Basin
Size: 2.3 million net acresProduction: Approximately 60% of Company total
The Williston Basin primarily consists of our Viewfield Bakken and Flat Lake light oil pools in Saskatchewan and is our largest production area. The Viewfield Bakken play has been developed into one of the most highly economic in North America and our waterflood development continues to enhance recovery factors in the play. We applied our technologies and techniques that originated in the Viewfield Bakken to unlock our emerging-growth Flat Lake play. Even though we have increased production in Flat Lake by more than 100 percent since 2012, the play remains in its infancy.
 
Our Williston Basin inventory also includes the Bakken and Three Forks formations in North Dakota as well as conventional assets in southeast Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

Southwest Saskatchewan
Size: 940,000 net acresProduction: Approximately 21% of Company total
Our southwest Saskatchewan assets are located in the Shaunavon and Viking resource plays. We own approximately 95 percent of the Shaunavon play’s significant oil pool with over 18 years of identified drilling locations. Our Shaunavon growth plan includes increased drilling activity and further expansion and development of our waterflood program which has shown significant improvements in decline rates and estimated recovery factors.
 
Since entering the Viking light oil resource play in 2012, we have continued to impress with strong results and attractive capital efficiencies. Continued high netbacks and large oil-in-place give the Company significant long-term upside in the Viking.

Uinta Basin
Size: 170,000 net acresProduction: Approximately 7% of Company total
Through an acquisition completed in late 2012, we established a significant position in the Uinta Basin light oil resource play in northeast Utah. We have recently initiated our horizontal drilling program in the area, with wells demonstrating results and generating returns similar to those in the Viewfield Bakken play. We’re in the early stages of discovery and have many years of development remaining.
