If you’re looking for unique, yet inexpensive souvenirs from Malacca, head to Tan Kim Hock Product Centre in Jalan Laksamana Cheng Ho. Located five minutes from the city centre, the product centre is also known as ‘red place’ by the locals, thanks to its massive scarlet building. With over 100 local food products under its roof, this is an immensely popular place for locals and tourists to shop for high-quality bites and goodies. Visitors might feel a little overwhelmed when stepping in – rows and rows of goods line the warehouse-like property, with boxes stacked as high as the ceiling! Rare, only-in-Malacca food products such as handmade coconut candy, gula Melaka (pure coconut sugar), medicated nutmeg balm and cincalok (fermented small shrimps or krill) are just some of the products sold at the centre, and if you’re curious (or unsure) about how these products taste like, samplers in plastic containers are available for guests. Dodol (sweet toffee-like confection) is one of their most popular products, and it comes in two flavours – durian and coconut – so if you still have no idea on where to start even after sampling, this is a good idea as your first purchase.

The food products available in Tan Kim Hock Product Centre are made with raw materials harvested on the company’s estates and processed in their factories, so authenticity is guaranteed. Tan Kim Hock also specializes in spices such as sambal ikan bilis and chilli prawn floss, and while maybe these products are ideally used in Asian cooking, they are still versatile food items that would be a great addition to the kitchen collection of any experimental and adventurous cook.



















Tan Kim Hock Product Centre also comes with its own durian cendol stall, right outside the shopping area. Durian cendol is one of Malacca’s celebrated food items and, in the hot Malacca weather, it is practically a saviour. It is basically a bowl with shaved iced lumped together with cendol (green worm-like jelly), red beans, and durian paste, so if you’ve always wondered what durian tastes like, this is a good introduction. Tan Kim Hock is an iconic Malaccan entrepreneur with two branches local product centre – one in Jalan Laksamana Cheng Ho as mentioned, and one at Jalan Bendahara. He sometimes makes an appearance at his shops, wearing his trademark white suits and giving out freebies to lucky visitors.

The Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE) is pleased to announce a generous gift of $4 million for the endowment of a new full professorship from alumus Hock E. Tan ’75, SM ’75. Tan’s gift will enable MechE to recognize an outstanding faculty member in the department and to support and enhance its research and educational programs.
The new professorship will be named in honor of Ralph E. and Eloise F. Cross Professor Emeritus Nam P. Suh ’59, SM ’61, a celebrated mechanical engineer and leader. Suh served as head of MechE from 1991 to 2001, and founded the Laboratory of Manufacturing and Productivity (LMP) and the MIT-Industry Polymer Processing Program. He served as president of the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) from 2006 to 2013.
Suh was also an influential and supportive mentor to Tan. “Professor Suh was an inspiration to me, as well as a friend,” Tan says. “I am very grateful for the support he gave me during my time at MIT.”
“I am thrilled," he continues, "to be giving back to an institution that enables a student experience, an ecosystem even, in which great innovators and teachers like Professor Emeritus Nam Suh have thrived and influenced generations of students.”
Tan came to MIT from Penang, Malaysia. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in mechanical engineering in the same year, and later earned an MBA from Harvard Business School. He has held several high-level finance and executive positions in companies like PepsiCo and General Motors, as well as technology companies, such as computer-manufacturer Commodore International and Integrated Circuit Systems. He currently serves as CEO of Avago Technologies, a company that is brokering the largest takeover in high-technology history with its purchase of BroadCom. Both companies sell communications chips.
“I am incredibly moved by Hock Tan’s gift and his investment in our future,” says Gang Chen, head of MechE and the Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. “It is wonderful that he has chosen to name this professorship in honor of Professor Nam Suh, who is a very special person in both our lives. Professor Suh played an important role in my life and career when he brought me to MIT as a faculty member in 2001.”
Tan’s gift will be honored this coming fall in conjunction with an 80th birthday celebration for Professor Emeritus Suh, being held at this year’s International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition.

Alternate drug delivery systems are therefore needed for drug abuse studies and in treatment clinics.   The dosage form should also be convenient for administration, cost-effective, and provide controlled pharmacological actions.  We propose an oral transmucosal system that provides a rapid onset of drug action (to address period of acute craving) followed by a prolonged release of the drug to maintain a lower, constant drug plasma concentration.  Such dual drug-release delivery system addresses the therapeutic gap problems of the fast-onset dosage forms (e.g., injections and nasal sprays) and sustained-release delivery systems such as transdermal patches and depot implants.   Also, this simple single-dosage form offers convenience of dose administration (thus ensures compliance); is less expensive (vs. implants, transdermal, nasal and inhalation devices); and improves bioavailability of drugs with high first-pass metabolism or significant gastrointestinal degradation (vs. oral dosage forms).New Jersey Small Business Development Centers (NJSBDC) Small Business Growth Success AwardNew Jersey Small Business Development Centers (NJSBDC)December 2009The annual Small Business Growth Success Awards recognize the efforts and success of small businesses in New Jersey, and share their stories about the power of ideas, vision and perseverance.   Bionex Pharmaceuticals LLC in North Brunswick worked with the NJSBDC Technology Commercialization Center on a National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposal for development of an intra-oral transmucosal thin-film for treatment of alcohol dependence. The proposal resulted in the receipt of a $165,000 award to demonstrate the feasibility of Bionex’s technology. The company also has received a NIH Small Business Innovation Research award for development of an oral transmucosal disc for smoking cessation.Biotech 2009 Conference Innovation Corridor Poster Winner. “Oral Transmucosal Drug Delivery System for Nicotine.”BioNJOctober 2009We develop an oral transmucosal drug delivery system that provides a rapid onset of drug action (to address period of acute craving) followed by a prolonged release of the drug to maintain a lower, constant drug plasma concentration.  Such dual drug-release delivery system addresses the therapeutic gap problems of the fast-onset dosage forms (e.g., injections and nasal sprays) and sustained-release delivery systems such as transdermal patches and depot implants.   Also, this simple single-dosage form offers convenience of dose administration (thus ensures compliance); is less expensive (vs. implants, transdermal, nasal and inhalation devices); and improves bioavailability of drugs with high first-pass metabolism or significant gastrointestinal degradation.SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) Award, Phase I. “Oral transmucosal drug delivery system for naltrexone for alcohol dependence treatment.”NIAAA (National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse), NIHSeptember 2009PROPOSED RESEARCH: This proposed SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a novel oral transmucosal drug delivery method and dosage form for alcohol dependence treatment.  The proposed system is a small, thin, and flexible film, containing the treatment drug, naltrexone.  It is applied intra-orally to affect a rapid onset of action, followed by moderate release of drug for extended pharmacological action.  The Phase I project will consist of design, fabrication and in vitro evaluation of thin-film dosage forms.  The dosage form is applied “as needed” when alcohol craving occurs.  The method/dosage form is cost-effective, convenient (can be administered without water), and could fill the gaps of current patient and market needs.PROBLEM/OPPORTUNITY:  There are two naltrexone products marketed for treatment of alcohol dependence: oral tablets and injectable depot formulation.  The former suffers from low bioavailability, poor patient compliance, and significant side effects.  The later overcomes bioavailability and patient compliance problems but is expensive, inconvenient and has injection site reaction.  Proposed drug delivery system is expected to overcome the poor oral bioavailability of the oral naltrexone tablets, and high cost and inconvenience of the injectable naltrexone depot formulations.  Results from this study are anticipated to lead to better efficacy, more convenient, and better patient compliance of alcohol-dependence medical treatment, and thus improve the health of alcoholism patients.  This market sector is presently under-served and has substantial potential.  The proposed technology could be extended and developed into improved dosage forms for other substance-addiction treatment medications.New Jersey Incubator Seed FundNew Jersey Commission of Science and TechnologyJanuary 2010Bionex is a pharmaceutical company focusing on development of novel drug delivery technologies and specialty pharmaceuticals.  We are working on two in-house novel drug delivery systems: bio-adhesive mucosal film and multi-zoned lozenge technologies for two pipeline products, an intra-oral transmucosal delivery system for smoking cessation therapy, and a local intra-oral delivery system for oral yeast infection treatment.  We have just completed an NIH-funded (SBIR Phase I) feasibility study and have developed a prototype formulation for our lead drug product, stop-smoking transmucosal film.  A provisional patent has been filed in May 2009.  Full-fledged product development program, clinical manufacturing planning, and marketing development are underway.  Funding from this application will be used to partially support our product development program, regulatory strategic planning, and filing of non-provisional patent.  We plan to apply for a SBIR Phase II award for further development such as GMP development, safety study and human clinical trials.SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) Award, Phase IINIAAA (National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse), NIHSeptember 2012The proposed SBIR Phase II project aims at developing a new drug product, the naltrexone orally dissolving film (ODF), for treatment of alcohol dependence.  The naltrexone ODF is a small, thin, and flexible film, containing naltrexone hydrochloride and other excipients.  It is applied intra-orally and adheres to the oral mucosa to affect a rapid onset of action due to oral mucosal absorption, followed by an extended pharmacological action.  The naltrexone ODF is administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to a drinking episode or as-needed when alcohol craving occurs.  The naltrexone ODF is novel, cost-effective, convenient to use, dissolves in the mouth without the need for water and fills the gaps of current treatment regimens and market needs. Phase I of this project was highly successful wherein the specific aims were met in demonstrating the feasibility of developing a prototype naltrexone ODF formulation which met the targeted milestone having optimal functional properties.  The Phase II program will extend to product development/ early-commercialization phase by validating the prototype formulation with IND-enabling safety studies, technology transfer and scale-up and manufacturing of clinical supplies. PROBLEM/OPPORTUNITY:  Naltrexone is an approved drug for treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence.  There are two naltrexone drug products marketed for treatment of alcohol dependence: oral tablets and injectable depot formulation.  The former suffers from low bioavailability, poor patient compliance, and significant side effects.  The later overcomes bioavailability and patient compliance issues but is expensive, inconvenient and has injection site reaction.  The proposed naltrexone ODF drug product is expected to overcome the poor oral bioavailability of the oral naltrexone tablets, and the high cost and inconvenience of the injectable naltrexone depot formulations.  The alcohol dependence medication market sector is under-served and has substantial potential.

Potent opiates can effectively reduce the severity of pain, thereby diminishing patient suffering.  Unfortunately, chronic use of these drugs can be harmful to patients, whether by inadvertent overdosing, unintentional addiction, or abuse resulting from dependency on the euphoric effects of the opiate. The magnitude of this problem as a public health issue has led FDA to require the engineering of abuse-deterrence mechanisms into all new products in this class.  The applicants seek to determine the feasibility of developing an abuse-deterrent analgesic which relies on a novel approach to administering an opioid via a transdermal patch. The most common methods of abuse involve either snorting, swallowing or injecting the contents of the product; therefore this patch would contain both a potent opioid agonist and an antagonist. Upon oral, nasal, or intravenous administration of the contents of the product, both agonist and antagonist would become bioavailable, thereby substantially blunting or eliminating opioid-induced euphoria.  However, when applied as a skin patch, only the agonist (not the antagonist) would be available for absorption through the skin.The aims of this project are 1) design, synthesis, and evaluation (releasability through hydrolysis) of modified antagonists, 2) design, preparation, and evaluation of transdermal patch containing the opioid drug and modified antagonists, along with patch evaluation, and 3) testing and evaluation of abuse-deterrent properties of the transdermal patch formulations.  In short, the above objectives will employ chemical synthesis of the modified antagonists, analysis of quantities of agonist and antagonist released from the patch under the various study conditions, and in vitro human skin permeation studies.PublicationsEffect of surfactants and pH on naltrexone (NTX) permeation across buccal mucosaInt J Pharm2011Authors: Hock Tan, Michniak-Kohn B, Vishwas Rai, PhD RPhCereal Bars Containing SAEF®, a Novel Superhydrating Fiber, Exhibit Significantly Greater Satiety-Enhancing Properties than Cereal Bars Containing Glucomannan in Simulated Stomach Model29th Annual Scientific Meeting of The Obesity SocietyOctober 2011Authors: Hock Tan, H Heshmati, Eyal S.

Bionex manufactured prototypes of a drug in various drug delivery means for evaluation for a clinical development program.  One formulation was chosen & developed based on desired patient specs, and Bionex prepared clinical trial material (CTM) under GLP for a successful pilot study.  For a follow-on study in Europe, Bionex then established and was certified GMP to manufacture the CTM.  Bionex also provided the required QA/QC drug release, labeling and stability studies.  Bionex and President Hock Tan PhD have always shown a very much appreciated capability and flexibility to work with SME to help in their R&D needs.See moreSee lessI have known Hock for 5 years and, among other projects, we worked with Hock on our jointly awarded SBIR project.  Hock is a great scientist with solid background and training in Chemistry and Engineering, and a highly motivated leader who has extensive experience in management of complex development programs.  He is especially competent in providing out-of-the-box solutions to complex problems.  Also, I am especially impressed with his pleasant personality (ability to establish a comfortable rapport with others, and client-focused aptitude), and effective communication skills.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended HockGroupsControlled Release SocietyGlobal Formulation and Drug DeliveryMedical Device Field - MDFieldTransdermal and Buccal Delivery Drug Development ProfessionalsExpert Witness NetworkBig Ideas in Pharma Innovation and R&D ProductivityExpert WitnessView Hock’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Hock directlyView Hock’s Full ProfileNot the Hock you’re looking for?

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
