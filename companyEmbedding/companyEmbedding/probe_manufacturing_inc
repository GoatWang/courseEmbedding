Certifications

International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
ISO gives the requirements for quality management systems, is now firmly established as the globally implemented standard for providing assurance about the ability to satisfy quality requirements and to enhance customer satisfaction in supplier-customer relationships.
Probe Manufacturing has developed and implemented this quality management system to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products that meet customer and statutory and regulatory requirements, and to address customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including continual improvement and the prevention of nonconformity. This is basically for quality check.
ISO 9001/2008 Certfication





British Approvals Board for Telecommunications (BABT)
BABT, based in Walton on Thames, Surrey is part of the Industry Division of the TÜV SÜD Group which employs over 13,000 people in 600 locations, and is one of the leading technical service companies in the world.
With over 25 years’ experience, BABT is the world’s leading impartial Telecommunications Certification Body, recognized and respected throughout the world for its expertise in approving products and systems to the Radio, Telecoms and IT sectors.
Our certification schemes give confidence that products and services comply with objective standards and relevant regulatory requirements.
				




International Patent Classification (IPC)
PMI has adopted IPC-A-610 Class II and Class III as its workmanship standard. An IPC training program has been implemented to all technicians. IPC is a U.S. based trade association that provides guidelines and standards for the design, manufacturing and acceptance of electronics and electromechanical assemblies.
				




Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
PMI is registered company with Food and Drug Administration making sure your products meet all aspects and regulations before entering the market.
If FDA grants an approval, it means the agency has determined that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks for the intended use.
To receive FDA approval for these devices, the manufacturer must demonstrate that its devices provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
				




Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA)
Probe Manufacturing addresses ESD as a serious reliability threat to our customer’s product. We take every effort to ensure strict compliance to Industry standards, such as EIA-2020 (Supersedes EIA-625) and have benchmarked a recognized OEM ESD leader.
				




Underwriters Labortories Inc. (UL)
UL is an independent product safety certification organization.
PMI is a UL-certified company and all products demonstrate compliance with the appropriate safety requirements, many of which are developed by UL. Our manufacturing processes also demonstrate that it has a program in place to ensure that each copy of the product complies with the appropriate requirements. If a product design is modified, it will be retested before a UL mark can be attached to the new product or its packaging.
				




CSA International (CSA)
CSA is accredited in the U.S. by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL), and in Canada by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC).
PMI test and certify products to applicable safety or performance standards including CSA-Certified and all products meet the requirements.
				




Production Part Approval Process (PPAP)
‘The Production Part Approval Process is used in the automotive supply chain to establish confidence in component suppliers and their production processes, by demonstrating that:
“….all customer engineering design record and specification requirements are properly understood by the supplier and that the process has the potential to produce product consistently meeting these requirements during an actual production run at the quoted production rate.”
PMI is making sure the following principals are met and implemented in our process and procedures:
1) The client’s requirements have been understood
2) The product supplied meets those requirements
3) The process (including sub suppliers) is capable of producing conforming product
4) The production control plan and quality management system will prevent non-conforming product reaching the client or compromising the safety and reliability of finished vehicles
				




Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS)
The directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 2002/95/EC; commonly referred to as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS, was adopted in February 2003 by the European Union.
RoHS is not the only environmental standard of which electronic product developers should be aware. Manufacturers will find that it is cheaper to have only a single bill of materials (BOM) for a product that is distributed worldwide, instead of customizing the product to fit each country’s specific environmental laws. Therefore, they develop their own standards, which allow only the strictest of all allowable substances.
PMI has adopted our own compliance marks to reduce confusion; although, RoHS does not require any specific product labeling and our processes and procedures comply with such standards when needed or it is a customer’s requirement.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  (unaudited)  Unless otherwise specifically stated, references in this report to "Probe," "PMI," "the Company," "we," "us," "our" and similar terms mean Probe Manufacturing, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  This report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and  OVERVIEW  Our Company  Probe Manufacturing, Inc. (the "Company," "Probe," or "PMI") headquartered in Irvine, California is a product development accelerator providing engineering and manufacturing services to startups and venture capital backed companies with emphasis in cleantech. Our cross-market segment experience from medical, instrumentation, to aerospace helps us bring effective solutions to tough technical product development and manufacturing problems. Our revenue is generated from sales of our core expertise in manufacturing, project management and product development incubation services.  We offer our customers' integrated design and manufacturing services, from initial product design to production and both pre and post sales services. Our engineering services include product design, printed circuit board layout, prototyping, and test development. Our supply chain management solutions include purchasing, management of materials, and order fulfillment. Our manufacturing services include printed circuit board assembly, cable assembly, mechanical assembly, and fully integrated box build systems for high complexity electronics.  Some examples of our customer's finished goods products include storage devices for wind and solar, energy savings lighting solutions, instrumentation devices, ultrasound therapeutic medical devices, PCB's for landing gear systems and flap controllers and fluid control units for airliners.  As innovation, cost, and time to market become hyper-competitive, both startups and VC backed companies are now compelled to use engineering and manufacturing partners with easy onshore access, providing local project management and manufacturing expertise during product conceptualization, development, and integration. Our project management and manufacturing expertise combined with our product development capabilities support clients through product development and design resulting in improved return on investment, utilization of global supply chain reducing material acquisition time and cost and accelerate time to market by rapidly executing newly defined production processes.  Our growth strategy is to leverage our currency and core competencies in product development incubation, project management and manufacturing for increased sales and equity opportunities.  Page 23 of 33  We believe that with our focus on Cleantech and new growing opportunities in our medical, aerospace and instrumentation segments we are able to leverage our core competencies for long term manufacturing agreements and equity opportunities resulting in increased sales, profitability and shareholder value.  On March 15, 2013, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition with Trident Manufacturing, Inc., a Utah corporation, ("Trident"), and the shareholders of Trident, to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock shares of Trident. Trident is a full-service electronics manufacturing service company with a 16,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility based in Salt Lake City, Utah and has been servicing the industrial, aerospace, military, instrumentation, and medical markets since 2005.  On March 20, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Trident whereby we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock shares of Trident and all its operational assets in exchange for 1,600,000 shares of our restricted shares of common stock. As a result of the acquisition, Trident has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Probe Manufacturing, Inc. As a result we recognized $420,673 in goodwill.  GOING CONCERN  The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder's deficit of $106,874 and a working capital deficit of $642,448 and a net loss of $100,741for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and an accumulated deficit of $2,405,944 as of March 31, 2015 and used $198,907 in net cash from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach a profitable operating stand and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.  Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:  � changes in the macro-economic environment and related changes in consumer demand;  � the mix of the manufacturing services we are providing, the number and size of new manufacturing programs, the degree to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity, seasonal demand, shortages of components and other factors;  � the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products, or when their products do not gain widespread commercial acceptance;  � our components offerings which have required that we make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products;  � our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers;  � our customers' ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities;  � our customers' decision to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements;  � our exposure to financially troubled customers; and  � integration of acquired businesses and facilities.  Page 24 of 33  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.  Refer to the accounting policies under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, where we discuss our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements.  RESULT OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales. The financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this document. In addition, reference should be made to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
