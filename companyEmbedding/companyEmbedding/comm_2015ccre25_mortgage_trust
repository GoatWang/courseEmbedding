          Meme from Pontotoc, Mississippi        
It is wonderful and I would and will recommend this to any one that is older or of my age to get this loan for security sake. I appreciate all that has been done for me. Being a widow and on a fixed income even thou I still work, it was very hard to make ends meet and be able not to worry each month about all the bills that had to be paid. Many thanks to all of you.

It is wonderful and I would and will recommend this to any one that is older or of my age to get this loan for security sake. I appreciate all that has been done for me.

Many thanks to all of you.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

Fitch to Rate COMM 2015-CCRE25 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through Ctfs; Presale Issued
Tweet


Print



      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM Mortgage Trust 2015-CCRE25 commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$49,855,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$15,061,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$88,315,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$225,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$410,926,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$856,831,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$67,644,000b class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$69,054,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$50,734,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,780,000 class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$119,788,000ab class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,780,000ab class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,594,0000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of July 28, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $22,548,000 class F 
      or the $40,869,434 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 84 loans secured by 145 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.13 
      billion as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Cantor Commercial Real Estate 
      lending, L.P., Silverpeak Real Estate Finance LLC, KeyBank National 
      Association, and Ladder Capital Financial LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 62.7% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 72.1%, and asset summary reviews on 72.1% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Leverage Slightly Higher than 2014 and 2015 Averages: The pool's Fitch 
      debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) are 1.11x and 
      110.5%, respectively. The leverage metrics for this transaction are 
      slightly higher than other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The 2014 average Fitch DSCR was 1.19x, and the average 
      Fitch LTV was 106.2%. The 2015 year-to-date (YTD) averages have a DSCR 
      and LTV of 1.21x and 109.1%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Two loans totaling 6.7% of the 
      pool have investment grade credit opinions on a stand-alone basis. 
      Pearlridge Center (4.3%) has an investment grade opinion of 'BBBsf' and 
      Scottsdale Quarter (2.5%) has an investment grade opinion of 'BBBsf'.
    

      More Diverse Pool: The top 10 loans comprise 40.3% of the pool, which is 
      lower than recent averages of 50.5% and 47.81% for 2014 and YTD 2015, 
      respectively. Additionally, the loan concentration index (LCI) is 289, 
      which is lower than the YTD 2015 average of 341.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.8% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). The following rating sensitivities describe how the 
      ratings would react to further NCF declines below Fitch's NCF. The 
      implied rating sensitivities are only indicative of some of the 
      potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors to which the 
      transaction is exposed. Stressing additional risk factors may result in 
      different outcomes. Furthermore, the implied ratings, after the further 
      NCF stresses are applied, are more akin to what the ratings would be at 
      deal issuance had those further stressed NCFs been in place at that time.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 
      2015-CCRE25 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 11 - 12.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 84 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary (RAC).

      Fitch to Rate COMM 2015-CCRE25 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





August 03, 2015 03:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM Mortgage Trust 2015-CCRE25 commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$49,855,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$15,061,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$88,315,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$225,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$410,926,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$856,831,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$67,644,000b class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$69,054,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$50,734,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,780,000 class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$119,788,000ab class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,780,000ab class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,594,0000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of July 28, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $22,548,000 class F 
      or the $40,869,434 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 84 loans secured by 145 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.13 
      billion as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Cantor Commercial Real Estate 
      lending, L.P., Silverpeak Real Estate Finance LLC, KeyBank National 
      Association, and Ladder Capital Financial LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 62.7% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 72.1%, and asset summary reviews on 72.1% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Leverage Slightly Higher than 2014 and 2015 Averages: The pool's Fitch 
      debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) are 1.11x and 
      110.5%, respectively. The leverage metrics for this transaction are 
      slightly higher than other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The 2014 average Fitch DSCR was 1.19x, and the average 
      Fitch LTV was 106.2%. The 2015 year-to-date (YTD) averages have a DSCR 
      and LTV of 1.21x and 109.1%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Two loans totaling 6.7% of the 
      pool have investment grade credit opinions on a stand-alone basis. 
      Pearlridge Center (4.3%) has an investment grade opinion of 'BBBsf' and 
      Scottsdale Quarter (2.5%) has an investment grade opinion of 'BBBsf'.
    

      More Diverse Pool: The top 10 loans comprise 40.3% of the pool, which is 
      lower than recent averages of 50.5% and 47.81% for 2014 and YTD 2015, 
      respectively. Additionally, the loan concentration index (LCI) is 289, 
      which is lower than the YTD 2015 average of 341.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.8% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). The following rating sensitivities describe how the 
      ratings would react to further NCF declines below Fitch's NCF. The 
      implied rating sensitivities are only indicative of some of the 
      potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors to which the 
      transaction is exposed. Stressing additional risk factors may result in 
      different outcomes. Furthermore, the implied ratings, after the further 
      NCF stresses are applied, are more akin to what the ratings would be at 
      deal issuance had those further stressed NCFs been in place at that time.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 
      2015-CCRE25 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 11 - 12.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 84 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary (RAC).

          Meme from Pontotoc, Mississippi        
It is wonderful and I would and will recommend this to any one that is older or of my age to get this loan for security sake. I appreciate all that has been done for me. Being a widow and on a fixed income even thou I still work, it was very hard to make ends meet and be able not to worry each month about all the bills that had to be paid. Many thanks to all of you.

It is wonderful and I would and will recommend this to any one that is older or of my age to get this loan for security sake. I appreciate all that has been done for me.

Many thanks to all of you.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.
