ALL ABOUT ORGANICS
When you choose organic food and other products, you’re helping more than yourself. You’re supporting farmers and producers who work hard to meet the standards because they believe in good health, quality and sustainability. It takes a lot and pays it forward.

        What Does Organic Mean?      

        All organic products begin as crops grown without toxic and persistent pesticides which can end up in soil and water, as well as in your food. Since 2002, all organic food products sold in the U.S. are required to meet strict USDA Organic standards.

      What Does Organic Mean?    



  












  




        Organic Standards in Brief      

        - No toxic or persistent pesticides or herbicides
- No sewer sludge or synthetic fertilizers  
- No GMOs (genetically modified organisms)
- No antibiotics
- No synthetic growth hormones
- No irradiation

        Organic Meat, Eggs and Dairy Products      

        Meat, eggs and dairy products with the organic label must come from animals fed organic – which also means non-GMO – feed, given fresh air and outdoor access and raised without antibiotics or added growth hormones*.

*Federal regulations prohibit the use of hormones in raising pork, poultry, goats, veal and bison. Organic standards prohibit hormones in raising beef and lamb as well.

        Organic Labeling      

        Deciphering product labels can be confusing. How can you be sure what the label means and whether it’s what you’re really looking for? For one, there’s a difference between products labeled “100% Organic,” “Organic” and “Made with Organic” ingredients. Rest easy, we’re looking out for you.

        Organic Food FAQ      

        Why eat organic? What are the most important foods to buy organic? Are organic foods non-GMO? We’ve been offering organic products since we opened our doors in 1980 so let us help you out with these questions and more.

        What is a Certified Organic Grocer?      

        While farms and processing facilities for organic products are required to get organic certification, it’s optional for retailers. For certification, there are numerous steps and processes to insure organic integrity from when products arrive at a store until you put them in your basket. That integrity is important to us – and many of our shoppers – so we became the first national certified organic grocer.

        How Does Biodynamic Farming Fit In?      

        Like organic farmers, certified Biodynamic farmers must use alternatives to synthetic chemical pesticides and fertilizers. In addition, Biodynamic farmers strive to nurture the potential of a farm’s own resources, which include water and biodiversity. However, not all Biodynamic farms are organic.

Aquaculture Products & Aquatic Supplies 

 
Florida Aqua Farms Inc., USA, is unique among aquaculture manufacturers. The original founders, Frank Hoff, William Hoff and Terry Snell were and continue to be directly involved in aquatic research, applied aquaculture and the aquarium industry since 1966. Collectively they have 88 years of experience in aquaculture.
Frank and William Hoff were the founders of Instant Ocean Hatcheries in 1974 , which was the largest closed cycle commercial marine tropical fish farm in the world. IOH was 100% independent of natural seawater and located in Dade City, Florida, 35 miles inland. Frank Hoff currently serves on the Board of Directors as a consultant to ORA (Oceans Reef & Aquariums) which is currently the largest marine tropical fish farm in the world.
Current and past endeavors and expertise of the founders includes; culturing micro and macroalgae, zooplankton culture, spawning and rearing freshwater discus and angelfish, saltwater clownfish, pompano, seabass and numerous other aquatic animals. Florida Aqua Farms Inc. continuously researches, formulates, tests and manufactures products found in this catalogue. Of considerable importance to you is the fact that the owners of Florida Aqua Farms Inc., currently use or have used most products found in this catalogue in their current or previous facilities. Using our product line allows us to make modifications and changes that benefit our customers. A significant portion of our product line is specialized towards intensive, closed culture of live foods including microalgae, rotifers, Artemia and daphnia. We offer many products suited for hatcheries, small wet-labs pilot scale projects or experimental work.
Some of our products are traditionally found in scientific research labs and educational facilities but, are often difficult for aquatic farmers or aquarists to locate or obtain. Other products are more common in the aquarium industry but, not usually found in aquaculture. This unique blend of products makes Florida Aqua Farms Inc., USA a special entity rather than another “me-too” manufacturer.
Current products include the brand names: “Resting-Rotifers™, Micro Algae Grow™, Plant Fuel, Plant Fuel Too, It’s Clear, Coralline Stimulator, Mass Pack™, Roti-Rich™, Hatch-Rite I and III, Plankton Collector™, Plankton Culture Manual™, Conditioning and Spawning of Fish, and Culture-Boy 3 & 5™.
Customers are number one. We will make every effort possible to help and advise you. We personally express our thanks for being one of our faithful and valued customers.

Thank you for visiting our site.

ALL ABOUT ORGANICS
When you choose organic food and other products, you’re helping more than yourself. You’re supporting farmers and producers who work hard to meet the standards because they believe in good health, quality and sustainability. It takes a lot and pays it forward.

        What Does Organic Mean?      

        All organic products begin as crops grown without toxic and persistent pesticides which can end up in soil and water, as well as in your food. Since 2002, all organic food products sold in the U.S. are required to meet strict USDA Organic standards.

      What Does Organic Mean?    



  












  




        Organic Standards in Brief      

        - No toxic or persistent pesticides or herbicides
- No sewer sludge or synthetic fertilizers  
- No GMOs (genetically modified organisms)
- No antibiotics
- No synthetic growth hormones
- No irradiation

      Organic Standards in Brief    



  












  




        Organic Meat, Eggs and Dairy Products      

        Meat, eggs and dairy products with the organic label must come from animals fed organic – which also means non-GMO – feed, given fresh air and outdoor access and raised without antibiotics or added growth hormones*.

*Federal regulations prohibit the use of hormones in raising pork, poultry, goats, veal and bison. Organic standards prohibit hormones in raising beef and lamb as well.

        Organic Labeling      

        Deciphering product labels can be confusing. How can you be sure what the label means and whether it’s what you’re really looking for? For one, there’s a difference between products labeled “100% Organic,” “Organic” and “Made with Organic” ingredients. Rest easy, we’re looking out for you.

        Organic Food FAQ      

        Why eat organic? What are the most important foods to buy organic? Are organic foods non-GMO? We’ve been offering organic products since we opened our doors in 1980 so let us help you out with these questions and more.

        What is a Certified Organic Grocer?      

        While farms and processing facilities for organic products are required to get organic certification, it’s optional for retailers. For certification, there are numerous steps and processes to insure organic integrity from when products arrive at a store until you put them in your basket. That integrity is important to us – and many of our shoppers – so we became the first national certified organic grocer.

        How Does Biodynamic Farming Fit In?      

        Like organic farmers, certified Biodynamic farmers must use alternatives to synthetic chemical pesticides and fertilizers. In addition, Biodynamic farmers strive to nurture the potential of a farm’s own resources, which include water and biodiversity. However, not all Biodynamic farms are organic.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
