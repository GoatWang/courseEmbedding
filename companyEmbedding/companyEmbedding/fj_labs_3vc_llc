Frontage Laboratories, Inc. Announces Formation of FJ Pharma, LLC, a 
      Joint Venture with Zhejiang Jiuzhou Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd. to Provide 
      API Development and Manufacturing Services






July 27, 2016 11:35 AM Eastern Daylight Time



EXTON, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Frontage Laboratories, Inc. announced that it has established a 
      joint venture with Zhejiang Jiuzhou Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. to provide 
      enhanced access to high quality and economical API & intermediate 
      development and manufacturing (CDMO) services to new US clients focused 
      on New Chemical Entities (NCE) and vertically-integrated generic APIs 
      that are developed through the combined efforts of Frontage and Jiuzhou. 
      The venture, named FJ Pharma, LLC, will utilize Jiuzhou’s vast 
      development and manufacturing infrastructures and experienced chemistry 
      teams in China and Frontage’s API development team and CMC drug 
      development services in the US. This relationship will help to 
      efficiently support NCE development, more effectively reach clients 
      interested in these services, and potentially offer vertically 
      integrated finished products via Frontage’s affiliate drug product CDMO 
      company, Frontida BioPharm, Inc. Jiuzhou and Frontage will continue to 
      offer exceptional service to their existing clients following the 
      formation of FJ Pharma.
    

      Commenting on the JV formation, Ms. Lirong Hua, CEO of Jiuzhou said, 
      “Jiuzhou continues to seek opportunities to improve and expand the depth 
      of services Jiuzhou can provide to its worldwide pharmaceutical customer 
      base. The FJ Pharma JV is an integral part of our forward-looking 
      strategy to further enhance our ability to support many of our US-based 
      business opportunities. The combination of Jiuzhou’s expertise in the 
      manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and associated 
      CDMO services - with the extensive formulation expertise and portfolio 
      of support services available within Frontage Laboratories provides our 
      customer base with the opportunity to access all the necessary services 
      to accelerate their IND development programs and commercialization 
      goals. We believe the FJ Pharma JV platform will serve as an incubator 
      that nurtures some of our developmental phase enquiries from our US 
      customer base, as well as a ‘bridge’ which links the skills of both 
      organizations to provide seamless commercial supply chain options for 
      selected customers and products”.
    

      Dr. Song Li, Founder and CEO of Frontage stated, “The formation of FJ 
      Pharma is an important milestone toward our goal to become a full 
      service provider to our partners for their pharmaceutical products’ 
      development. We are pleased to work with Jiuzhou in providing 
      intermediates and APIs to clients. FJ Pharma’s API services will 
      complement the high quality drug product development services offered by 
      Frontage and CDMO services offered by Frontida, and provide our 
      long-term clients integrated product development, manufacturing and 
      commercial support.”
