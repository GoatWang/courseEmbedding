We receive royalty revenues from existing licensing arrangements with other companies primarily related to sales of four marketed drug products, namely, PegIntron®, Sylatron®, Macugen® and CIMZIA®. We also had previously received royalty revenues from licensing arrangements related to sales of Oncaspar and Adagen until our rights to receive royalties on sales of these products expired in 2014. In addition, our rights to receive royalties on sales of Macugen and CIMZIA expired in the U.S. and Great Britain in 2014. The primary source of our royalty revenues is sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck.

These are our current clinical studies. For more details on a particular product candidate, click on its name.




















PEG-SN38 (EZN-2208)
Through the use of our PEGylation technology, we designed PEG-SN38 (EZN-2208), a PEGylated conjugate of SN38, to offer therapeutic advantages over unmodified SN38 and existing therapies.  The PEGylated version allows parenteral delivery, increased solubility, higher exposure, more profound deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, inhibition of angiogenesis, and longer apparent half-life of SN38.
See presentations and publications »


HIF-1 alpha antagonist (EZN-2968)
HIF-1 alpha is over-expressed in many cancer types, including common solid tumors.  It is a key regulator of numerous genes important in cancer biology, and is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy.  Drugs targeting HIF-1 alpha thus have the potential to target multiple cancer processes.  
See presentations and publications »


Survivin antagonist (EZN-3042)
Survivin plays a vital regulatory role in both apoptosis and cell division.  Survivin is highly expressed in many cancers and in newly formed endothelial cells engaged in angiogenesis, with little expression in normal adult tissues.  Resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapy and cytotoxic drugs is strongly correlated with expression levels of Survivin.  Clinically, Survivin expression is associated with poor prognosis, increased cancer recurrence, and resistance to therapy.    .
See presentations and publications »


Androgen receptor mRNA antagonist (EZN-4176)
The AR is a validated target for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Several approved androgen-blocking or –binding agents have therapeutic benefit, but prostate cancer typically develops resistance to these agents.  Enzon’s LNA-based AR mRNA antagonist provides a novel and innovative strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer.  In preclinical studies, Enzon’s mRNA antagonist down-regulated the AR, inhibited tumor growth when given alone, and enhanced the anti-tumor activity of conventional agents that inhibit AR activity.
See presentations and publications »


mRNA antagonists
Enzon is developing additional LNA-based mRNA antagonists to other targets that drive tumor growth.  We have worldwide rights, except for in Europe, to develop and commercialize the compounds. Lead molecules that target HER3 and beta-catenin have demonstrated anti-tumor activity in animal models of human cancer.

Enzon’s two versatile platform technologies are the basis of its four clinical-stage product candidates and multiple preclinical compounds. Enzon currently receives royalties on a number of marketed products based on its Customized PEGylation Linker Technology, which is also employed by one other product candidate currently under late-stage development. 
For information about partnership opportunities, please contact Enzon’s business development team at partnering@enzon.com.




Customized Linker Technology
Our core expertise has been in engineering improved versions of injectable therapeutics through the chemical attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) using our Customized Linker Technology. This PEGylation technology employs proprietary chemical linkers designed to either release the native molecule at a controlled rate or provide permanent linkage that will maximize inherent activity of the native molecule.  In some cases, PEGylation can render a compound therapeutically effective, whereas the unmodified form had only limited clinical utility. A number of marketed biologic products utilize this novel PEGylation platform. 

To order PEG Reagents, please contact NOF Corporation at: dds-drug.com and peg-drug.com



Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA)
It is now clear that many of the most important targets that drive tumor growth are currently unapproachable with antibodies (because they are intracellular) or very difficult to drug with small molecules.  Enzon has licensed a number of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) antagonists based on Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) technology to inhibit transcription factors or molecules that rely on protein-protein interaction to drive tumor growth and are considered difficult to drug. Enzon’s LNA-based oligonucleotides have demonstrated in preclinical models that such compounds can down-regulate the target and inhibit tumor growth, thereby supporting clinical studies. We hold rights worldwide, other than in Europe, to develop and commercialize these mRNA antagonists, which target hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), Survivin, androgen receptor (AR) and additional targets in preclinical research.
