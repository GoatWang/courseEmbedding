“Averaging” Health Care Costs Disguises Usage Patterns For Working America – CNBC Article
According to this CNBC article posted below and linked here (Here’s how much the average American spends on healthcare), the “average” American spent $9,595 in 2012. “Average” is a tricky term and worthy of a precise discussion here.

Hixme offers insurance that works for workers – regardless of ACA/AHCA ping-pong
The traditional employer benefit structure is crippling employers, workers and their dependents. Can the controversial health reform experiment offer a clue to a better way? With the continuing focus on how to best insure Americans and the political ping-pong surrounding fixing or replacing recent healthcare reform, perhaps lurking in [...]

The Cost of Healthcare

A Conversation with Hixme’s CEO, Denny Weinberg
January 13, 2017 The Financial Revolutionist Saying that health care insurance is just a health care issue is misleading to say the least. Sure, the term health care insurance includes the word “health care,” but health care insurance and benefits impact every sector of America’s economy.

About Brent Fulk, your San Jose insurance agent.
Hi, my name is Brent Fulk. I have been an insurance agent with GEICO since 2003 and your local San Jose insurance agent since 2007. My office serves the Silicon Valley Area, from Fremont to San Mateo, and Monterey through the South Bay. We can help insure your home and auto as well as your motorcycle, boat, and RV.
The San Jose agents are here to help.
We understand the great diversity of the San Francisco Bay Area and the South Bay. At the San Jose local GEICO office, we have agents who speak Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Hindi. When you get a quote through our office, we'll make sure all your eligible discounts are applied. We make doing business with GEICO easy for you.
Spot Brent and his team in the community.
I'm a member of the Campbell Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Silicon Valley, and the Silicon Valley Capital Club. I also coach in the Almaden Little League.
Look for our San Jose insurance agents at local events such as the San Jose Sharks Street Rally or at San Jose State University football games. My office is also a drop-off site during the holidays for the Harvest Food Bank and for the USMC Toys for Tots. Stop by and say "hello!"

Information You Provide.

                          We and our service providers may collect any information that you provide when you use the Websites, including information when you contact
                          us with a question, comment, or request; complete surveys; register with us for any subscription or account-based services we may offer.
                        

                          The information that you provide us can include, but is not limited to, your name, address, email address, phone number, and comments you
                          provide or submissions you make. This may include information regarding you or your family’s use of health care.  Providing this information
                          is optional and is not required for Hixme to provide you our services.
                        
Information Your Employer Provides.
The Websites also feature information that your employer provided to us for purposes of administering your enrollment in their benefit
                          plan(s). This includes, but is not limited to personal identification information for you and your covered dependents (such as Social Security
                          number, gender, date of birth) and your current elections in your employer’s benefit plan(s).
                        
Information Automatically Collected From You.

                          We and our service providers may automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device over time and across
                          different websites when you use the Websites, such as your Internet Protocol address, your general location, your browser type, your operating
                          system, the pages you view on the Websites, the pages you view immediately before and after you access the Websites, and the search terms you
                          enter on the Websites. When you use our mobile services, with your consent, we may collect information about your precise location using
                          methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, and Wi-Fi access points.
                        

                          We, and third parties, including our service providers, may collect this information using “cookies” or similar technologies.  Cookies are
                          small text files that many websites save on your browser when you visit. These websites access cookies when you return to the site to recognize
                          repeat visitors and to analyze how customers use and access a website. Please review your web browser’s “Help” file to learn how to modify
                          your cookie settings. Web beacons are snippets of code embedded in webpages and are typically used to monitor activity on a webpage, collect
                          information, or transfer information to servers.
                        

                          We use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the Websites. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users
                          visit the Websites and what pages users visited prior to visiting the Websites. We use this information to maintain and improve our
                          Websites. For information about how Google uses the information, see Terms of Service and
                          the Google Privacy Policy. You can opt out of Google Analytics by
                          visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
                        

                          We may combine the information you provide us and information we automatically collected with information from public or
                          third-party sources.
                        
How We Use Information


                          We may use the information we collect for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to:
                        

                          We use the information that we collect and receive to provide you with products and services and to operate, maintain, and enhance
                          the Websites. For example:
                        


To Provide Our Services. We use the information we collect and receive to provide you with the products, services, or
                            information that you request; to provide you with information about the Websites or required notices; and to customize your
                            experience when using the Websites, among other things.
                          

To Improve Our Services. We use the information we collect and receive to improve the Websites we provide, such as
                            by better tailoring content to user needs and preferences; and by generating and analyzing statistics about your use of the Websites.
                          

To Communicate With You. We use the information we collect and receive to communicate with you about our Websites and

                            detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other
                            misuse of the Websites.
                          


                          We may also use the information we collect and receive as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.
                        
How We Disclose Information


                          We may share certain information that we collect or receive in order to provide the products and services that you have requested, when
                          we have your consent, or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.  We do not rent or sell personal information to third parties for
                          their own use except as may be disclosed in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection.
                        


Service providers. We may share your information with service providers that provide services to us in connection with our business
                            operations and have agreed to use the information solely in furtherance of our operations (e.g., web hosting, mailing services, and
                            payment processing).
                          

Business Transactions. We may share information in association with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate
                            transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets.
                          

Others In Connection With Administrative Or Legal Processes. We may disclose your information to third parties as required by
                            law or regulation and when we have a good faith belief that it is necessary in order to protect the legal rights, safety, and security
                            of Hixme, our affiliates, our business partners, and users of our Websites; to enforce our Terms of Use; to respond to and resolve claims
                            or complaints; to prevent fraud or for risk management purposes; and to comply with or respond to law enforcement or legal process or a
                            request for cooperation by a government or other entity.
                          

We may share information that is not reasonably identified with you for any purpose.
Our Commitment to Data Security


                          Hixme has established company-wide security policies and practices designed to protect your and others information from unauthorized intrusion.
                          We strive to make certain that our servers and connections incorporate the latest encryption, firewalls and security devices. We have
                          implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect, including multiple layers of
                          password protection. Credit card and personal information is transmitted by secure servers and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
                          encrypts information you input. Documents are delivered to you via UPS or similar overnight delivery services, the United States Postal
                          Service, or email. Unfortunately, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure and we therefore cannot guarantee the security of
                          information you transmit to or from the Site, Applications, or through the use of our services, and you provide this information at your
                          own risk. ACCORDINGLY, THIS DISCLAIMER RELEASES LIABILITY FOR THE THEFT, LOSS, OR INTERCEPTION OF, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DAMAGE TO, YOUR
                          DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS BY USING THE SITE, APPLICATIONS, AND OUR SERVICES. BY CONTINUING ON WITH OUR SITE AND SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
                          YOU UNDERSTAND AND ASSUME THESE RISKS.  Our policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore
                          beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.
                        
How We Protect Data


                          We implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information collected by the Websites.
                          Any transmission, storage or use of your personal information is carried out in compliance with all applicable Federal and State laws including
                          the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (as amended and commonly referred to as “HIPAA”). Because no information system can be
                          fully secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Hixme and you do so at your own risk. Moreover, we are
                          not responsible for the security of information you transmit to the Websites over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and
                          wireless networks.
                        
How We Retain Data


                          We may retain information that can reasonably identify you for as long as your account is active or as we determine is needed for our
                          reasonable business purposes, including to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
                        
Choice and Access


                          If you no longer wish to receive account or marketing communications from us or if you wish to inquire about the information we have
                          collected about you, please submit a request at the contact information listed below or utilize any opt-out option contained in any
                          marketing email we may send you.
                        

                          We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that indicate a preference for not having information
                          collected over time and across different web sites. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. Visit
                          www.allaboutdnt.org to learn more. If you do not want the Websites to collect information through the use of cookies, you can set your web
                          browser to reject cookies from the Websites.
                        

                          If you would like to update your information, please contact your human resources or benefits administrator at your employer. If
                          you have further questions, you may contact us by using the contact information listed below.
                        
Third Party Sites


                          The Websites also may contain links to third party sites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use
                          of your information by such third parties that are not under our control.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each website
                          you visit.
                        
Children’s Information


                          The Websites are not intended for—and are not directed towards—individuals under 13.  As such we do not knowingly collect information from children
                          under the age of 13 and request that those individuals do not provide us with personal information.
                        
Changes to this Privacy Policy


                          If we update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a new Privacy Policy.  If we make any revisions that materially change the ways
                          in which we use or share the information previously collected from you through the Websites, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of
                          such changes.  Your continued use of the Websites after changes to the Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the new policy.

                          If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our use of your information collected through the Websites, please contact us at

Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers has led a $10.14 million Series A funding round for Hixme Insurance Solutions. Dr. Beth Seidenberg has been added to Hixme’s board of directors.

Based in California, Hixme Insurance Solutions is a platform that helps employers transition to a private benefit exchange.
PRESS RELEASE
AGOURA HILLS, Calif., October 7, 2015 — Hixme Insurance Solutions, Inc., a technology-enabled platform that helps employers transition to a new type of market-based private benefit exchange, today announced that it has raised $10.14 million in a Series A funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB). Coincident with the investment, KPCB General Partner Beth Seidenberg, M.D. has joined Hixme’s Board of Directors, and Veteran Health Care Executive and former Wellpoint Co-Founder Denny Weinberg has joined as its CEO. Denny is regarded as the creator of the consumer health plan marketplace and the architect of the open-access PPO alternative to the early HMO platform.
Hixme challenges conventional wisdom about group health and other benefits, which are increasingly cumbersome to administer and confusing to employees in the post-ACA world. Hixme offers a dramatic new approach to employee benefits by opening up access for each employee to a wealth of retail and personalized options specific to where each employee lives and works. For the first time, employees won’t be dependent on employers to make this choice for them. The result: Under a Hixme platform, employees design, choose and then actually own their benefits, which are completely portable but subsidized by their employer. 





“We founded Hixme because we believe that there is a better way of delivering a broader array of benefits, starting with healthcare to employees,” said Hixme CEO Denny Weinberg. “Hixme is the first benefits technology and service platform that provides employees access to the vast market of several thousand benefit plan choices. We do this by providing employers a technology platform and servicing support that stages the transition to Hixme in a seamless way over the course of several months.”
KPCB General Partner Beth Seidenberg, M.D. added: “We are currently seeing a huge shift in how healthcare is paid for and delivered. Hixme is at the forefront of companies who can free employers from the chore of benefit plan design and empower the individual employee and family members. This is made possible with the Hixme technology platform. As a physician I believe that empowering people to choose the right benefit for their unique needs will lead to lower costs and better overall health of the population.”
Hixme is investing the proceeds of this financing in operational growth to further technology development and its national rollout.
ABOUT HIXME, INC.
Hixme was founded in 2013 by professional benefit consultants Dan Peate and Karen Albanese following long careers servicing larger employers. Hixme was created as the first technology-enabled Private Exchange in the expanding post ACA marketplace. Hixme’s technology and service model is designed for larger, often multistate employers with complex insured or self-funded benefit programs. Hixme’s unique migration model from employer-owned to employee-owned benefits comes from Hixme’s vision of Bringing Back The Benefit that employees once valued highly. Hixme operates from locations in California with plans to open offices throughout the country in 2016 and 2017. For more information, visit hixme.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
