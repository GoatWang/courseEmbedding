Financial stewards for over 50 years.
We believe that successfully managing wealth is a long-term proposition, requiring strategic thinking and dedication. Privately held since the 1960s, Foster Dykema Cabot’s succession through four generations and the longevity of our team has provided continuity for our clients. Many of our client relationships span multiple generations and are a testimony to the trust and confidence our clients feel with us.
We recognize that our clients’ needs are sophisticated and require more personalized attention, expertise and nuance than many financial institutions are able to provide. Because we have always specialized in handling the affairs of affluent clients, we understand the specific needs that will inevitably arise and can anticipate the questions that are likely to come up. How do we sustain our wealth? What about the future education of our children and grandchildren? How do we minimize our estate taxes? While tried-and-true solutions fit some questions best, others require innovation and flexibility that only a certain calibre of expertise and experience can answer.
At Foster Dykema Cabot, our clients receive prompt, personalized service and recognize that our planning and investment approach is rigorous, disciplined, and forward looking. Senior members of our team are always accessible and communication with clients is ongoing and proactive. Our goal is to fully understand your personal needs and those of your family so that we can help you turn your objectives into a customized financial action plan that works for you.

We construct portfolios that are customized, diversified and responsive.
Foster Dykema Cabot’s investment approach recognizes that your goals and needs for wealth management are unique. We listen carefully to you to understand your objectives, values, concerns, and preferences while taking into account your family dynamics, financial resources, and feelings about risk. We then develop a financial plan for you, customizing the investments in your portfolios to meet your specific requirements.
After reviewing your objectives, we help you select an appropriate long-term strategy or base-policy mix of assets that best aligns your return objectives with your ability and willingness to take risk. Our approach provides the balance and diversification essential to build consistent returns as well as the discipline needed to keep your investments on track during periods of market turbulence. If you have an existing portfolio, we review legacy holdings and develop a plan to minimize capital gains as we reposition your portfolio for maximum benefit. To that end, we make adjustments when we identify attractive investment opportunities or believe it is prudent to mitigate risk. We also rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure that investments stay aligned with your goals.
Foster Dykema Cabot helps you make sense of the array of investment choices by selecting appropriate fixed-income, equity and alternative investments for your portfolio based on extensive fundamental analysis. Unlike many larger firms, our judgment is not clouded by potential conflicts of interest. As an independent firm, we do not answer to a corporate parent that must please multiple constituencies with conflicting objectives nor do we earn additional fees to manage proprietary products or refer business to third-party advisors. Our focus is exclusively on the needs of our clients and this provides us with the freedom to provide unbiased and objective advice and select best-in-class investments from a broad universe of choices.
Our experience has shown that the best opportunities are frequently found in market segments that are currently out of favor. These investments can provide a margin of safety that reduces downside risk and improves long-term returns. Taking a long-term view towards investing enables us to take advantage of inefficiencies caused by the short-term focus of other investors. Whether it is investing in the public equity or fixed-income markets or in private equity, we seek investments that will build long-term value in your portfolio.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Donaldson Company (NYSE:DCI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $47.00 (0.04% downside)
