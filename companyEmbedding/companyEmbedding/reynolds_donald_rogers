Leading by Example

A MESSAGE FROM LANCE MITCHELLCEO, Reynolds Consumer Products
As a new company, we have been pleased to join two brands... Reynolds Wrap® and Hefty® ... both well-known and trusted brands from successful legacy companies.
We've worked to develop our mission/values statement, strategy, and long-term business goals. We're committed to working safely, innovation, and the driving results with teamwork and collaboration. While we are an international presence, we're also small enough to know our customers by their first names. We're looking for people that will help us reach our goals.
Please take a few minutes to read what some of our employees think about working here.
