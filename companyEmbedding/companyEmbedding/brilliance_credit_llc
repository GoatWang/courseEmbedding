Provide a "YES!" every time, create happy customers, and grow your business










More Options For Consumers Means More Growth For Your Business...Brilliant!
How many times have you helped a customer only to realize what you've recommended is beyond their financial reach? Until recently, independent businesses were at a significant disadvantage to the national brands when it came to safe and secure financing options, particulary for those customers with less-than-perfect credit. Brilliance Credit has leveled the playing field.
Brilliance Credit was founded to support independent businesses in your efforts to help more consumers obtain the financing they need and to help your business grow. The process is simple. The financing is guaranteed. Your customer is thrilled.
Become a Partner Today!
With Brilliance Credit’s world-class customer support and ability to offer financing to everyone that walks into one of our five stores, we’ve had tremendous success capturing a significant amount of the market we were unable to before we signed up with them. I would recommend Brilliance Credit to any retailer looking to grow their business and increase sales.
Robert G., Texas

Provide a "YES!" every time, create happy customers, and grow your business










More Options For Consumers Means More Growth For Your Business...Brilliant!
How many times have you helped a customer only to realize what you've recommended is beyond their financial reach? Until recently, independent businesses were at a significant disadvantage to the national brands when it came to safe and secure financing options, particulary for those customers with less-than-perfect credit. Brilliance Credit has leveled the playing field.
Brilliance Credit was founded to support independent businesses in your efforts to help more consumers obtain the financing they need and to help your business grow. The process is simple. The financing is guaranteed. Your customer is thrilled.
Become a Partner Today!
With Brilliance Credit’s world-class customer support and ability to offer financing to everyone that walks into one of our five stores, we’ve had tremendous success capturing a significant amount of the market we were unable to before we signed up with them. I would recommend Brilliance Credit to any retailer looking to grow their business and increase sales.

CREDIT SCORE RATINGS
POOR (300-561)
Nearly 15% of the U.S. population has a credit score of 561 or less. A Poor score makes it difficult for you to qualify for the best interest rates on loans, and lenders may require you to have a cosigner and/or a significant down payment.



CREDIT SCORE RATINGS
FAIR (562-665)
For many lenders, Fair is viewed as an "average" credit score. You are not likely to be offered the best interest rates on loans or credit cards, but the terms in most cases will be better than for those with Poor scores.



CREDIT SCORE RATINGS
GOOD (666-754)
Good scores get better lending rates. This range typically indicates you are effectively managing your finances, and you are likely to be offered better interest rates on loans or credit cards.



CREDIT SCORE RATINGS
GREAT (755-850)
You're in the top range! This means you're a very low-risk borrower and have done a superb job of managing your finances. You'll most likely get the very best interest rates on loans or credit cards.








Why do I need to check my Credit Scores?
Good credit scores are your passport to competitive interest rates for mortgages, cars, credit card offers, insurance premiums, and more.  Strong scores are worth money because they save you in excess costs.









Credit FAQs

How can I reach customer care?

                            Customer Care is available toll-free seven days a week at
1-800-972-7204.
                        
What should I watch for in my credit reports?

                            In addition to confirming your basic information, such as your name, address, and social security number, also watch for errors and signs of fraud:
							
New accounts that you do not recall opening
Derogatory information that is not up to date, such as loan payment history (note that bankruptcies stay on your credit file for several years)
Derogatory information that is incorrect, including missed payments, collection actions, eviction, or repossessions
Excessive inquiries into your file

Why is it important to check my credit reports?

                            It's wise to check your credit reports frequently for signs of fraud. If someone obtains your social security number, only a few additional pieces of information are necessary to perpetrate fraud in your name. Common types of identity theft include fraudulent bank accounts, credit cards, utilities, and loans. According to the FTC, victims of identity theft spend an average of 175 hours and $800 to clear their names. Early detection is the key to avoid suffering long-term financial consequences.
                        
How many credit reports do I have?

                            Most consumers have three credit reports in their name – one from each credit reporting agency (TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian). ScoreSense provides you access to the information that all three credit reporting agencies keep on file for you. You can refresh your credit reports and scores with ScoreSense every month.
                        
Why are my credit scores so important?

                            Your credit scores are used by lenders to represent your overall level of credit risk. They are essentially numerical summaries of the information in your credit reports. The higher your scores, the better your credit, and the more likely lenders will be to give you a favorable interest rate on a loan. Each of the three major credit bureaus has its own method for determining a credit score, but they are essentially equivalent.
                        
How high or low can my credit scores be?

                            Credit scores range from 300 to 850 – the higher your scores, the more favorable interest rates you will receive on a loan.
                        
Will checking my credit reports adversely affect my credit?

                            Requesting your own credit reports will not affect your credit rating. On the other hand, inquiries such as mortgage, loan, and credit card applications will affect your scores if several of these inquiries occur over a relatively short time frame. Some studies have indicated that this suggests you may be a higher credit risk.
