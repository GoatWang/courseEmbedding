History[edit]
Stance was founded in 2009 by Jeff Kearl, John Wilson, Aaron Hennings, Ryan Kingman and Taylor Shupe. The original founders saw an opportunity to address a category of fashion they felt had been overlooked by many brands and the majority of the industry.[9]
The company first began shipping product in 2010, and has since shipped over 15 mil. pairs of socks, has raised a significant amount of venture capital and is sold in over 40 countries worldwide.[10][11]
In March 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported the company had raised $50 million from Silicon Valley venture capital firms and that the brand would be expanding into men’s underwear. In April 2015, the NBA announced that Stance had been named the official on-court sock of the NBA starting in the 2015-2016 season. As part of the deal, Stance would be allowed to display its logo on all socks worn on-court by players, a first in NBA history for apparel companies.[12] Stance opened its first store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City in November 2015.[5]
In 2015, Stance posted a 356% employee increase from the previous year, reaching 114 employees, at its San Clemente headquarters. Stance was listed No. 24 on the Orange County Business Journal’s list of the 51 Biggest Based in Orange County Apparel Businesses.[citation needed]
Sponsorship[edit]
Stance’s brand ambassadors are called "Punks and Poets". They include musicians, athletes, designers, artists, stylists, writers and photographers.[13]

Blog(us)|Jeff Kearl — Founders Circle



















































Blog(us)|Jeff Kearl




 







Jeff KearlTAKING A STANCE ON VALUEAll of us are out to build sustainable businesses and household brand names. But when I look across many emerging product companies, I keep seeing an over focus on customer acquisition in expensive online channels. There are several unhealthy side effects to this. Here are a few of them.






Jeff Kearl  | Founder, Chairman & CEO, Stance | Circle Member



THE BEST BRANDS ARE BUILT THROUGH GOOD OLD FASHIONED WORD OF MOUTH DISCOVERY AND THIS TAKES PATIENCEPaid customers are worth less than organically acquired ones. At Stance, there’s a dramatic difference in repeat purchase rates between naturally acquired and paid or persuaded customers.When people discover a great brand, product or service, they enjoy sharing it with those closest to them. They generally explain why they perceive your value proposition to be good and add their testimonials. This is very powerful and a hallmark of nearly every brand we admire today. The problem is these one-to-one endorsements tend to happen slowly for most brands (with an exception occurring when the product or service is incredibly disruptive such as Uber, Skype or Spotify).  The opposite of this is when a company solicits and persuades a new customer to do business with them through an advertisement—and often through a discount offer—thus robbing them of the eventual personal discovery experience they would have had through one of their friends or family. You effectively trade off a personal one-to-one endorsement in the future in exchange for a persuaded customer available from advertising today.This isn’t to say that customer acquisition can’t play a role in your growth or that you can’t create conditions to enable natural word of mouth marketing. But too often, I see emerging companies using Google, Facebook, podcasts and the like to buy customers, seemingly as the extent of their strategies.Their presentations are full of cohort data. They feel validated when they show high top-line growth, which, in turn, attracts investors. They may even show what appears to be great LTV data.But great investor slides often lead to more venture capital to spend on customer acquisition. Building brands and insanely great products take time and I argue that introducing customers to your brand exclusively through direct response ads will have dangerous long-term side effects in the form of unsustainable economics and ultimately customer churn. It may take several years to manifest, but eventually competitive pressures, changing capital markets, or your own balance sheet will reveal that this growth strategy was fool’s gold.PAID ACQUISITION ADDICTIONI’m not the first person to observe this, but, as common sense isn’t always common practice, I’ll continue. I saw a presentation by Bill Gurley at the Benchmark portfolio conference in 2006 where he effectively compared AdWords to a highly addictive drug. This was over 10 years ago!Companies become addicted to paid customer acquisition because no one ever turns off revenue—unless they run out of cash for acquisition. You might as well move the expense from OPEX to COGS, because it’s never going away. At best, it’s a significant, permanent expense that will likely go up over time because media is a commodity that goes up in price as more advertisers join the network. At worst, it was a mirage and your CAC/LTV model was wrong because it was based on a short history and you didn’t factor in decay.So why do companies do it? Well, paid acquisition is formulaic and therefore relatively easy. Creating a brand that resonates with customers, designing great products and finding organic ways to introduce customers to your company are all very difficult.LOW GROSS MARGINS AND HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF REVENUEA quick study of publicly traded consumer brands such as Nike, Lululemon, Michael Kors and Under Armour reveals that their gross margins and operating expenses all fall within fairly narrow ranges. These businesses are at scale and therefore different than a startup. At the same time, every consumer product startup will eventually need to have their numbers in similar ranges in order to make a profit.Unfortunately, another common trait I see is that many emerging product companies have much lower gross margins (and much higher operating expenses) than the public group. By low, I mean gross margins less than 45%, which is lower than nearly the entire public comp group.Real gross margin includes duties, freight and a margin for distressed inventory. Unless the business has an unfair advantage that will eventually allow for exceptionally low OPEX (less than 35%), low gross margin signals a business with little future value, because low gross margin businesses struggle to produce real cash flow.As we all know, eventually every business is valued on expected future cash production. Unfortunately, up until very recently, today’s venture capital market has been typified by huge rounds at high valuations into unprofitable companies with high growth rates—which, again, are often due to large paid acquisition budgets.It’s a cycle that allows companies to become very large without ever fundamentally validating their businesses.I don’t like to pick on any company, especially one where I wasn’t in the board meetings. But since they’re gone, Fab appears to be the quintessential example. Hundreds of millions of dollars were transferred from venture capitalists to Fab and from Fab to Google and Facebook. Yes there was a payroll and rent, but the acquisition spend was historic for a startup. The resulting growth obscured what was happening in that business and whether it had a durable model.Except in the most competitive and clearly lucrative market opportunities, I prefer a different approach: grow organically and profitably until the value proposition is proven and then accelerate.As an entrepreneur time is the most valuable thing I have. I want to know as soon as possible if the value proposition works. If it doesn’t, I need to pivot or shut down and try another idea. The worst situation is a startup that confuses a repeatable value proposition with validation from a CAC/LTV model or a venture capitalist.As the entrepreneur, you could spend years building a business that’s never going to work. I maintain that when startups build paid acquisition as their first channel, the company’s real value proposition—and its ability to produce cash flow—remain unproven. Don’t be deceived: As my friend Bob Kagle likes to say, “It’s easier to raise venture capital than get money from a full price customer.”

Highlights from Stance CEO Jeff Kearl’s SIMA Surf Summit keynote address


May 18, 2017

                By Gabriela Aoun

The 20th annual SIMA Surf Summit kicked off Wednesday evening at the Marquis Los Cabos hotel.
Stance President John Wilson opened the evening with the 8th annual toast to late SIMA Chairman Emeritus Dick Baker.
Wilson said that if Baker were here today, he would likely advise four things: “Be bold and take risks, stay committed and passionate to surfing and the industry that surrounds it, embrace change as opportunity, and you guys better have fun.”

Stance CEO Jeff Kearl delivered the keynote speech. He posed a question that no doubt will be a theme of the three-day summit: Why are so many brands suffering when surf participation is seemingly at an all-time high, and millennials have some of the strongest purchasing power in history?
Kearl’s discussion was wide-ranging, offering several case studies, including that of Stance itself, as well as insight from Steve Jobs’ marketing philosophy and from brands outside of surf, such as Bonobos.
Kearl largely credited Stance’s initial success to asking one question: “What category can be made interesting? Where is there room for differentiation in a homogenized genre?” In Stance’s case, the answer was socks, but Kearl still sees opportunity in other categories. He cited the examples of Under Armour and Lululemon, both of which also started with a “hero product,” and did not diversify their product line until 8-10 years in.

Kearl then moved on to marketing, citing a transcendent speech by Steve Jobs when he launched Apple’s “Think Different” campaign. “The best brands stand for something more,” says Jobs. “We have to be really clear on what we want the world to know about us.” Jobs offered the example of Nike, which sold shoes, but never mentioned shoes in its marketing, instead honoring great athletes.
Kearl then posed the same question to brands within the industry. “What do our brands stand for?” he asked. And perhaps more important, even if a brand knows what it stands for, have they successfully delivered that message to the consumer?
After marketing, Kearl turned to the issue of retail. There is a widespread assumption that e-commerce is destroying retail, but Kearl pointed out that a.) 68% of e-commerce in 2016 was from Amazon, skewing the statistics on actual growth and b.) while traditional and multi-brand retail may be suffering, innovative retail ideas are thriving.
He cited the examples of Bonobos, which uses “guideshops” to direct consumers to buy online, and Shoes of Prey, which uses retail presence in Nordstrom for brand awareness, despite being rooted in online purchasing.
Among many other thought starters that Kearl posited, the one that perhaps seemed most crucial to him is for the surf industry to catch up to the youth’s changing buying behavior.
“We are not in the flow,” Kearl said, referring to the way a typical 17-year-old finds brands and makes purchases. The industry must adjust to social media-integrated purchasing as well as an expectation from the youth culture that purchasing be as convenient as pushing a button on their mobile phone. He made references to Stance’s plans to put more focus on Instagram as a growth opportunity.
Though the list of areas where Kearl saw room for industry improvement was long, he was also optimistic. The surf industry is made up of people “who created careers doing the thing they loved,” he said. That lends itself to a continuous source of creative inspiration, which can be capitalized on when facing the challenges of the digital age.
