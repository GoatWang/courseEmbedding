Publisher's Description▼▲
While most of us aren't hoarders we can all benefit from assessing and reducing the clutter in our homes--and then organizing what's left. Many things stop us from succeeding: the sheer scope of the project, the tendency to lose momentum if the job takes too long, and the fact that we're always acquiring new clutter. But what if it really took only a week to de-clutter the whole house, and then you even had the weekend to relax and enjoy your new clutter-free space? Could it really be that simple?Organizing and time management experts Sandra Felton and Marsha Sims show how with the right game plan and a healthy dose of adrenaline, anyone can de-clutter their home in just five days. With this systematic, team-based approach, even the most overwhelming de-cluttering job becomes doable. The authors' enthusiasm and energy keep readers pushing forward to the goal, and their time-tested tips and habits help readers maintain their hard-won gains. The authors even show how to deal with common obstacles to achieving and keeping a clutter-free house, like filing, storage needs, health issues, space restrictions, the car, and even family sabotage!

            As a recovering clutterer I have tried many fixes and fads to cure me of it. Some work for a season but never stick. I never found a working solution until THIS book! (I know, that sounds like an infomercial) I was very skeptical and went into reading it with the knowledge it might be another "quick fix" and not a solution. These two women KNOW what they are talking about. They tried and proved that this method WORKS!


After only a few pages of them explaining fully, even for those who need it spelled out, I was off and running to do what they said! It is a wonderful idea that totally makes sense. YOU are still in charge, not others. If you are a clutter person you know exactly what I mean by that being a good thing. I did not have the availability of doing this in a week, with helpers, for my review. Because of that, I, myself, did what they recommended the "helpers" doing and it works! I have emptied half this house already in the space of two weeks - not joking.


I love how they have it all organized and separated into thoughtful, concise steps. Finally someone has hit the nail on the head as to how to satisfy the clutterer while helping them DE-clutter!


I was given this book by the Book Club Network for an honest review.

            I admit I'm quite organizationally challenged! My kids are getting older (my youngest is 11) and pretty soon I'll run out of excuses for my disorganized home :). Undoubtedly, the title of this book piqued my curiosity. Does it take only 5 days to get one's house to become clutter-free? Surely, they haven't seen my house :)! My family and I have been in this current house for almost 5 years and we still haven't unpacked all the boxes yet :)! However, that could be viewed as a blessing in disguise (less things to organize and put away...they're already in boxes).


This book is divided into 2 sections: Section One--Getting It Under Control and Section Two--Keep the Good Life Going. The authors introduce the Mount Rushmore Method and employ the box system. The "rush" refers to the speedy 5 days of clearing up the clutter and the "more" refers to a team (more than 1 person). They also suggest setting a specific, tangible goal and a deadline. Another important factor is having a game plan which includes deciding in advance where to store boxes, labeling boxes, and using the body as a guide for each day's decluttering tasks (by focusing on different parts/levels of the home from the ground up). This is an interesting concept that helps break down that "overwhelming" dread of decluttering into a bite-sized, doable mission. The key is teamwork (many hands make light work). You're to invite people to come help you organize for 5 days and then celebrate the result with a party on the 6th day. I think the idea is great but I don't think it will work well for everyone. Some people (such as perfectionists and introverts) would have a hard time with this approach :). Or those who really value their privacy. The book does mention that the plan can be accomplished even by someone working alone but it just takes longer. There are many useful, practical ideas & tips in this book such as 6 steps to an organized life, steps to make the boxes disappear, rules of storage, ten-minute tidy checklist, etc. I enjoy learning strategies from real-life stories and gleaning from their experiences what works and what doesn't.


Once your home becomes clutter-free, how do you make sure it is kept that way? Session Two addresses this concern. It covers how to manage ourselves, our house, our family, and our time. The authors present clutter-buster habits to cultivate, house clutter-busters, family clutter-busters, time clutter-busters, tips for getting rid of stuff, and top ten tips for de-cluttering and staying de-cluttered. Lots of helpful resources are additionally included in the appendix. If you are discouraged by the disarray of your home, check this book out! I've been motivated and encouraged by it and I hope to put what I learned into action soon. Clutter begone! A clean and organized home is a restful and inviting home. I'm visualizing it right now :). Now what I need is...to just do it!

            Some really good practical tips to rid your home and life of clutter. Easy to read and follow guidelines to get organized and stay that way.


Since I'm a pack-rat, I was skeptical about these ideas working, but they actually do. I have to admit that it's difficult to part with stuff when you're used to keeping "things". I think the key is to realize that they are just that, "things". ÃÅ


Thank you Sandra and Marsha for writing this book.
