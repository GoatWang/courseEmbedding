Biography[edit]
Merton was born in New York City to a Jewish father[2] sociologist Robert K. Merton and mother Suzanne Carhart who was from a "multigenerational southern New Jersey Methodist/Quaker family."[3] He grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mathematics from the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University, a Masters of Science from the California Institute of Technology, and his doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970 under the guidance of Paul Anthony Samuelson. He then joined the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he taught until 1988.[4] Subsequently, Merton moved to Harvard University, where he was George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration from 1988 to 1998 and has held the John and Natty McArthur University Professorship since 1998. On June 11, 2010 it was announced[5] that Merton would retire from Harvard and rejoin the MIT Sloan School of Management. Merton also sits on the QFINANCE Strategic Advisory Board.
Career[edit]
Robert C. Merton is the School of Management Distinguished Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is resident scientist at Dimensional Fund Advisors, where he developed a next-generation integrated pension-management solution system that addresses deficiencies associated with traditional defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans. Merton is University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University. He was the George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration (1988–98) and John and Natty McArthur University Professor (1998–2010) at the Harvard Business School. He previously served on the finance faculty of the Sloan School from 1970 until 1988. Merton received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for expanding the Black-Scholes formula. He is past President of the American Finance Association, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His most notably recognised for his height, being an individual who is taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger (self-proclaimed).
Merton’s research focuses on finance theory including lifecycle finance, optimal intertemporal portfolio selection, capital asset pricing, pricing of options, risky corporate debt, loan guarantees, and other complex derivative securities. He has also written on the operation and regulation of financial institutions. Merton’s current academic interests include financial innovation and dynamics of institutional change, controlling the propagation of macro financial risk, and improving methods of measuring and managing sovereign risk. He is the author of, Continuous-Time Finance, and a co-author of Cases in Financial Engineering: Applied Studies of Financial Innovation; The Global Financial System: A Functional Perspective; Finance; and Financial Economics.
Merton has also been recognized for translating finance science into practice. He received the inaugural Financial Engineer of the Year Award from the International Association of Financial Engineers in 1993, which also elected him a Senior Fellow. Derivatives Strategy magazine named him to its Derivatives Hall of Fame as did Risk magazine to its Risk Hall of Fame. He also received Risk’s Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the field of risk management. A Distinguished Fellow of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance ('Q Group') and a Fellow of the Financial Management Association, Merton received the Nicholas Molodovsky Award from the CFA Institute.
His first professional association with a hedge fund came in 1968. His advisor at the time, Paul Samuelson, brought him on board Arbitrage Management Company (AMC), to join founder Michael Goodkin and chief executive Harry Markowitz. AMC is the first known attempt at computerized arbitrage trading. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart & Co. in 1971.[6] In 1993, Merton co-founded a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, which earned high returns for four years but later lost $4.6 billion in 1998 and was bailed out by a consortium of banks and closed out in early 2000. In 1997 he received the Nobel Prize for his contributions in Economics.
Personal life[edit]
Merton married June Rose in 1966. They separated in 1996. They have three children; two sons and one daughter.
Honours and awards[edit]

In 1993, Merton became a member of the U.S. United States National Academy of Sciences.
In 1997, Merton was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Myron Scholes for their work on stock options.[7]
In 1999, Merton was awarded a lifetime achievement award in mathematical finance.[8]
In 2005 the Baker Library at Harvard University opened The Merton Exhibit in his honor.[9]
In 2010, Merton received the Kolmogorov medal.[10]

Merton was born in New York City to a Jewish father[2] sociologist Robert K. Merton and mother Suzanne Carhart who was from a "multigenerational southern New Jersey Methodist/Quaker family."[3] He grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mathematics from the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University, a Masters of Science from the California Institute of Technology, and his doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970 under the guidance of Paul Anthony Samuelson. He then joined the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he taught until 1988.[4] Subsequently, Merton moved to Harvard University, where he was George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration from 1988 to 1998 and has held the John and Natty McArthur University Professorship since 1998. On June 11, 2010 it was announced[5] that Merton would retire from Harvard and rejoin the MIT Sloan School of Management. Merton also sits on the QFINANCE Strategic Advisory Board.
Career[edit]
Robert C. Merton is the School of Management Distinguished Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is resident scientist at Dimensional Fund Advisors, where he developed a next-generation integrated pension-management solution system that addresses deficiencies associated with traditional defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans. Merton is University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University. He was the George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration (1988–98) and John and Natty McArthur University Professor (1998–2010) at the Harvard Business School. He previously served on the finance faculty of the Sloan School from 1970 until 1988. Merton received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for expanding the Black-Scholes formula. He is past President of the American Finance Association, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His most notably recognised for his height, being an individual who is taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger (self-proclaimed).
Merton’s research focuses on finance theory including lifecycle finance, optimal intertemporal portfolio selection, capital asset pricing, pricing of options, risky corporate debt, loan guarantees, and other complex derivative securities. He has also written on the operation and regulation of financial institutions. Merton’s current academic interests include financial innovation and dynamics of institutional change, controlling the propagation of macro financial risk, and improving methods of measuring and managing sovereign risk. He is the author of, Continuous-Time Finance, and a co-author of Cases in Financial Engineering: Applied Studies of Financial Innovation; The Global Financial System: A Functional Perspective; Finance; and Financial Economics.
Merton has also been recognized for translating finance science into practice. He received the inaugural Financial Engineer of the Year Award from the International Association of Financial Engineers in 1993, which also elected him a Senior Fellow. Derivatives Strategy magazine named him to its Derivatives Hall of Fame as did Risk magazine to its Risk Hall of Fame. He also received Risk’s Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the field of risk management. A Distinguished Fellow of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance ('Q Group') and a Fellow of the Financial Management Association, Merton received the Nicholas Molodovsky Award from the CFA Institute.
His first professional association with a hedge fund came in 1968. His advisor at the time, Paul Samuelson, brought him on board Arbitrage Management Company (AMC), to join founder Michael Goodkin and chief executive Harry Markowitz. AMC is the first known attempt at computerized arbitrage trading. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart & Co. in 1971.[6] In 1993, Merton co-founded a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, which earned high returns for four years but later lost $4.6 billion in 1998 and was bailed out by a consortium of banks and closed out in early 2000. In 1997 he received the Nobel Prize for his contributions in Economics.
Personal life[edit]
Merton married June Rose in 1966. They separated in 1996. They have three children; two sons and one daughter.
Honours and awards[edit]

In 1993, Merton became a member of the U.S. United States National Academy of Sciences.
In 1997, Merton was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Myron Scholes for their work on stock options.[7]
In 1999, Merton was awarded a lifetime achievement award in mathematical finance.[8]
In 2005 the Baker Library at Harvard University opened The Merton Exhibit in his honor.[9]
In 2010, Merton received the Kolmogorov medal.[10]

He previously served on the finance faculty of the Sloan School from 1970 until 1988. Merton received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for expanding the Black-Scholes formula. He is past President of the American Finance Association, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His most notably recognised for his height, being an individual who is taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger (self-proclaimed).
Merton’s research focuses on finance theory including lifecycle finance, optimal intertemporal portfolio selection, capital asset pricing, pricing of options, risky corporate debt, loan guarantees, and other complex derivative securities. He has also written on the operation and regulation of financial institutions. Merton’s current academic interests include financial innovation and dynamics of institutional change, controlling the propagation of macro financial risk, and improving methods of measuring and managing sovereign risk. He is the author of, Continuous-Time Finance, and a co-author of Cases in Financial Engineering: Applied Studies of Financial Innovation; The Global Financial System: A Functional Perspective; Finance; and Financial Economics.
Merton has also been recognized for translating finance science into practice. He received the inaugural Financial Engineer of the Year Award from the International Association of Financial Engineers in 1993, which also elected him a Senior Fellow. Derivatives Strategy magazine named him to its Derivatives Hall of Fame as did Risk magazine to its Risk Hall of Fame. He also received Risk’s Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the field of risk management. A Distinguished Fellow of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance ('Q Group') and a Fellow of the Financial Management Association, Merton received the Nicholas Molodovsky Award from the CFA Institute.
His first professional association with a hedge fund came in 1968. His advisor at the time, Paul Samuelson, brought him on board Arbitrage Management Company (AMC), to join founder Michael Goodkin and chief executive Harry Markowitz. AMC is the first known attempt at computerized arbitrage trading. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart & Co. in 1971.[6] In 1993, Merton co-founded a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, which earned high returns for four years but later lost $4.6 billion in 1998 and was bailed out by a consortium of banks and closed out in early 2000. In 1997 he received the Nobel Prize for his contributions in Economics.
Personal life[edit]
Merton married June Rose in 1966. They separated in 1996. They have three children; two sons and one daughter.
Honours and awards[edit]

In 1993, Merton became a member of the U.S. United States National Academy of Sciences.
In 1997, Merton was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Myron Scholes for their work on stock options.[7]
In 1999, Merton was awarded a lifetime achievement award in mathematical finance.[8]
In 2005 the Baker Library at Harvard University opened The Merton Exhibit in his honor.[9]

Robert C. Merton - Biographical
I was born in New York, New York, on July
  31, 1944, the middle child between two sisters, Stephanie and
  Vanessa. I grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, a village of about 8000
  outside the city, in a house that Vanessa and her family live in
  today. My father, born in Philadelphia the son of immigrant
  parents, was a professor of sociology at Columbia
  University. He is now University Professor Emeritus at
  Columbia, having meanwhile been awarded the National Medal of
  Science for founding the sociology of science and for his
  contributions to sociological knowledge such as the
  self-fulfilling prophecy and the focus group. My mother, from a
  multigenerational southern New Jersey Methodist/Quaker family,
  stayed at home. She died in 1992. My mother's mother and many (at
  one time 25) cats completed the household that shared my
  childhood.

  Hastings was a mixed middle-class and blue-collar town with local
  employment dominated by a wire and cable company and a chemical
  plant. Despite this composition and the town's small size, the
  local public school provided a fine education opportunity. In a
  graduating class of only some 90, I nevertheless was able to take
  mathematics through the calculus and five years of science (two
  in physics including a MIT-designed course). I was a good student
  but not at the top of my class. I played varsity football and ran
  track, neither with great distinction. Among my classmates were
  the sons of the Columbia physicists and Nobel laureates, James Rainwater and
  Jack
  Steinberger. Other long-time Hastings residents were the
  laureate in medicine, Max Theiler, and the
  laureate in economics, William
  Vickrey, as well as the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz.

  School work and intellectual interests such as music and the arts
  were not especially important to me while I was growing up,
  although mathematics, my favorite subject, was fun. Baseball was
  my first passion: I played sand lot and Little League, and rooted
  for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Around age 11, that passion began to
  turn toward cars. On my bedroom wall, I put a large sheet of
  paper with 1800-plus numbers: one to be crossed out each day
  until I would be old enough for my driver's license. As I had
  known all the batting averages and pitching records of big league
  baseball players, so I came to know the horsepower, cubic inches
  of engines size, and other detailed specifications of just about
  every automobile in the post-war era. Going to auto shows and
  stock car races and handing tools to older, amateur buffs working
  on their cars were outlets for my passion until, at age 15, I
  bought and rebuilt my first car. After getting my driver's
  license, I built street hot rods which I raced at drag strips in
  upstate New York and Long Island. I thought that I would become
  an automobile engineer when I grew up. Indeed, while in college,
  I spent two summers working for Ford in its headquarters in
  Dearborn, Michigan: one as an engineer in advanced vehicle design
  and the other in the Lincoln-Mercury division trying to figure
  out optimal importing patterns for the English Ford. Other than
  working in a local cemetery after school and in the summer during
  high school and a summer spent in information technology at IBM,
  these automotive jobs were the only full-time, non-academic ones
  I have had.

  Both of my parents played important roles in my early life of
  learning. My father introduced me to baseball, poker, magic, and
  the stock market (only magic didn't take root). And books of
  every kind were everywhere. He said nothing directly about
  expected academic performance. There was no need to. Simply by
  self-exemplification, he set the standards for work effort and
  for clarity of thought and expression. I had the normal
  father-son tensions as a teenager, but we subsequently became
  very close: for more than 30 years, we have talked to each other,
  at least once, nearly every day. My mother taught me caring and
  sensitivity towards the feelings of others, animals as well as
  humans. She gave me much good, practical advice for getting
  through life. One such counsel in particular I have applied often
  and in varied arenas: "First show them that you can do it their
  way, so that you earn the right to do it your way."

  One week before my 17th birthday, I had a blind date with June
  Rose, a television actress on network soap operas, a model, and a
  regular on the popular Dick Clark's Saturday night American
  Bandstand show from New York. We were married five years later,
  one week after my graduation from Columbia. We devoted much
  energy to and derived enormous pleasure from raising three
  wonderful and talented children, Samantha J., Robert F., and Paul
  J. June and I separated in 1996.

  My arrival at college marked the beginning of serious focus on
  academic matters. Just one day after entering Columbia College I
  switched to the Engineering School. With its small and flexible
  program and fine faculty, it was a great place for an
  undergraduate to explore mathematics and its uses. I took several
  undergraduate and graduate mathematics courses, both applied and
  pure: my tastes were however clear, preferring partial
  differential equations to real analysis and the calculus of
  variations to functions of a complex variable. Along with a
  number of engineering courses including drawing, I also took
  Columbia's famous Contemporary Civilization course, humanities,
  one introductory course in economics (using Samuelson's
  Economics), a graduate course in mathematical sociology,
  and two general studies night courses in accounting and stock
  market investments. The C- or D received in my English literature
  course in my sophomore year did not help my grade point average.
  The paper onGulliver's Travels written for that course,
  however, became my first published article (in the Journal of
  the History of Ideas).

  After Columbia, I went west to pursue a Ph.D. in applied
  mathematics at the California Institute of Technology. My time at Cal
  Tech (1966-67), brief as it was, added significantly to my stock
  of mathematics. Even more valuable to me was its creed of placing
  students from the outset in a research framework, "playing" with
  their subject instead of merely passively learning the material.
  Sometime during the year, I decided to leave Cal Tech (and
  mathematics) to study economics. Although he thought it was a
  bizarre idea, Gerald Whitham (the department head) provided
  generous help. I applied to half a dozen good departments, but
  only one, M.I.T., accepted me, and it gave me a full
  fellowship.

  My decision to leave applied mathematics for economics was in
  part tied to the widely-held popular belief in the 1960s that
  macroeconomics had made fundamental inroads into controlling
  business cycles and stopping dysfunctional unemployment and
  inflation. Thus, I felt that working in economics could "really
  matter" and that potentially one could affect millions of people.
  I also believed that my mathematics and engineering training
  might give me some advantage in analyzing complex situations.
  Most important in my decision was the sense that I had a much
  better intuition and "feel" into economic matters than physical
  ones. Nowhere was that more apparent to me than in the stock
  market.

  As early as 8 or 9 years of age, I developed an interest in money
  and finance, even at play. I created fictitious banks such as the
  RCM Savings of Dollars and Cents Company. I gladly balanced my
  mother's check book. As already noted, my father introduced me to
  the stock market. At 10 or 11, I drew up an "A" list of stocks,
  and bought my first one, General Motors. In college, I spent time
  doing some trading, learning tape watching, and hearing the lore
  of the market from retail traders in brokerage houses. In late
  1963, I had my first experience in what is now known as "risk
  arbitrage". The trade surrounding the merger of Friden Company
  and Singer Company involved buying Friden shares and shorting
  Singer shares in a ratio of 1.75-to-1. The current difference in
  value between the two would become a "sure-thing" profit,
  provided the merger went through. Fortunately for me, it did. At
  Cal Tech, many mornings I would get to a local brokerage house at
  6:30 am (9:30 am in New York) for the opening of the stock
  market, spend a couple of hours watching the tape and trading,
  and then go to my classes. In addition to stocks, I traded
  warrants, convertible bonds, and over-the-counter options.
  Although I did apply mathematical skills, my valuation approaches
  were essentially ad hoc. Nevertheless, I learned much from
  those varied transactional experiences about markets and
  institutions which proved useful in my later research. For
  instance, in discovering specialized banks that would legally
  finance my convertible bond positions at 85 percent of their
  value (leveraging terms considerably superior to the 50 percent
  financing offered by standard margin accounts), I learned early
  on that the "institutional rigidities," often postulated as
  inviolate in academic financial-market modeling, can be more
  flexible and permeable in their real-world counterparts.

  When I arrived at MIT in the fall of 1967, I discovered why they
  had admitted me when no other institution had: Harold Freeman,
  statistician and member of the economics department from
  pre-Samuelson days. Harold had recognized some of the
  mathematicians who had written my letters of recommendation and
  convinced the department to take a flyer. Now in the role of
  first-year advisor, he saw my proposed, "traditional" course plan
  and told me "...you follow that and you'll leave here by the end
  of the term out of boredom ... go take Paul Samuelson's mathematical economics
  course." I did. Not only did I get to interact with Paul
  Samuelson, but I met the then second-year students, Stanley
  Fischer and Michael Rothschild. I learned economics from Paul's
  Foundations and wrote a term paper on an optimal growth
  model with endogenous population changes which was later
  published in 1969. As a result of our meeting in his course, Paul
  hired me as his research assistant that spring. Quite a yield
  from a single course!

  In the course of my work for Paul, we discovered shared interests
  and some common knowledge about the stock market, warrants and
  convertible securities. I found out that my "after/before-hours"
  interest in such things could also be a legitimate part of my
  day-hours devoted to research. In the summer of 1968, we began a
  joint effort to advance Paul's 1965 theory of warrant pricing,
  which was subsequently published in 1969. Later in October, I
  would have my first experience presenting in a formal seminar. My
  co-author decided that I, the second-year grad student, and not
  he, the Institute Professor, would give our paper at the
  inaugural session of the MIT-Harvard
  Mathematical Economics seminar. With a full audience of Harvard
  economics faculty including Kenneth
  Arrow, Wassily Leontief, and
  Hendrik Houthakker, it was surely a memorable baptism.

  The research with Paul on warrant pricing introduced me to the
  expected utility maxim and its application to optimal portfolio
  selection in a static framework. As a consequence of that effort,
  I began to think about combining the static theory of portfolio
  selection with the intertemporal optimization of lifetime
  consumption under certainty found in the growth-model literature.
  Ignorant of the important work underway by Nils Hakansson and
  Hayne Leland, then graduate students elsewhere, I attacked the
  problem of dynamic portfolio theory in a continuous-time
  framework without having the benefit of their discrete-time
  formulations. Despite all the mathematics courses that I had
  taken, l had seen neither stochastic dynamic programming nor the
  Ito calculus, both of which turned out to be key mathematical
  tools needed for this research. Instead, driven by "need," I
  found them and learned them on my own. Presented first at a
  Harvard-MIT graduate student seminar in November 1968, my paper
  on lifetime consumption and portfolio selection under uncertainty
  was published the following August as a companion paper to one by
  Paul investigating the effect of age on portfolio risk
  tolerance.

  Despite having Paul Samuelson, Franco Modigliani, Robert Solow, Frank Fisher, Robert
  Bishop, Evsey Domar, Peter Diamond, Peter Temin, and Ed Kuh as
  teachers, I must confess that my focus was more on research than
  classes from the beginning (and my course grades reflected that).
  However, no one could have had a better introduction to economics
  than I did, with these great teachers and the opportunity to live
  in Paul Samuelson's office as his assistant for two and a half
  years. Three of the five chapters of my thesis were published
  before the thesis was submitted. A fourth, "Optimum Consumption
  and Portfolio Rules in a Continuous-Time Model," was presented at
  the Second World Congress of the Econometric Society in August
  1970 and was published in 1971. During those most productive days
  of graduate study, I also developed much of my 1970 working paper
  on equilibrium asset pricing and the pricing of the capital
  structure of the firm which formed the core of my later papers on
  the intertemporal capital asset pricing model, the rational
  theory of option pricing, and the pricing of corporate
  debt.

  Paul nominated me to be a Junior Fellow at Harvard. After being
  rejected, however, I had no choice but to get a job. I spent the
  fall and winter of 1969 interviewing only with departments of
  economics, but I ended up taking an appointment to teach finance
  at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. It was Franco Modigliani,
  with a foot in both the department and Sloan, who made the
  invitation and who convinced me that I could teach there even
  though I had no formal training in finance. I had been a student
  of Franco's and my research on optimal lifetime consumption and
  portfolio selection supported his Life-Cycle Hypothesis. Our
  relationship, however, became even stronger in the years after I
  joined Sloan. I was especially honored and greatly touched when
  he invited me to be the speaker at the traditional American
  Economics Association luncheon honoring him for receiving the
  1985 Nobel Prize. That occasion (the remarks later published in
  Economic Perspectives) provided the opportunity to
  express, albeit inadequately, the deep respect and affection I
  hold for Franco. Some years later, he made a physically very
  demanding trip to Rome specifically to be the speaker at the
  National Academy
  of Lincei on the occasion celebrating my receiving the
  International INA-Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei Prize.

  It was in the process of interviewing for the job at Sloan that I
  met Myron Scholes, a recent arrival to the faculty from the
  University of
  Chicago. As I note in the accompanying lecture, the story of
  my meeting Myron Scholes and Fischer Black and our subsequent
  interactions and collaborations are well described in Myron's
  Nobel Lecture, in our joint tribute in memory of Fischer Black,
  in Fischer's own writings, and in the book by Peter Bernstein.
  Thus, even with its obvious central importance to my professional
  life, both its academic and practitioner parts, there is no need
  to repeat it here.

  When I joined the finance group at M.I.T., the faculty consisted
  of assistant professors Myron Scholes, Stewart Myers, and Gerry
  Pogue and senior professors Daniel Holland and Franco Modigliani.
  Dan specialized in tax matters and Franco was involved in many
  things everywhere. As a consequence, de facto, the junior
  faculty "ran" everything in the group with respect to both
  teaching and research. It was a wonderful environment of benign
  neglect in which all of us could grow. I enjoyed teaching from
  the start. My first experience was in 1969 as one of four
  graduate students (Karen Johnson, David Scheffman, and Jeremy
  Siegel were the others) who team-taught the second monetary
  course usually taught by Paul Samuelson. I began, however,
  full-time teaching at Sloan in the fall of 1970 with two regular
  courses in the Master's degree program in management: general
  finance and advanced capital markets. In the basic course
  involving both capital markets and corporate finance, I taught
  Markowitz-Tobin portfolio
  theory, the Sharpe(-Lintner-Mossin)
  Capital Asset Pricing Model, and the Modigliani-Miller theorems,
  learning much of the material barely before I presented it to the
  students. For my own sense of security and to provide some
  evidence of preparation to the students, I gave them detailed
  (handwritten) teaching notes for each class. Lecturing from them
  saved me from having to write everything down on the blackboard
  and saved the students from having to copy what I would have
  otherwise written. This in turn left more time for in-class
  discussion. These notes became so popular that I prepared similar
  ones for every course I taught at Sloan, long after I had learned
  the subject matter. In the capital markets course that first
  year, I introduced intertemporal portfolio selection,
  Black-Scholes type option pricing and hedging and its application
  to the pricing of corporate liabilities. I did so not as an
  "outlet" for presenting my research interests but because I
  thought that the training would be quite useful in practice. I
  believed that teaching this material, even before it was
  published, was more important for the M.S. students than for the
  Ph.D. students since non-academic jobs were not likely to provide
  the same opportunity as academics to keep up with the research
  literature after graduation. At Sloan in those days, M.S. and
  Ph.D. students in finance took the same courses, and so both
  groups were exposed to this research long before its
  publication.

  Throughout the 18 years I spent at the Sloan School, it was a
  stimulating and happy place to do research. I shall always owe a
  great debt to my brilliant colleagues there: Myron Scholes and
  Fischer Black, Franco Modigliani, Stewart Myers, John Cox, Chi-fu
  Huang, Terry Marsh, Richard Ruback, Douglas Breeden
  (unfortunately, only as a visitor), and from the Economics
  Department, Stanley Fischer and Paul Samuelson. The tenure and
  the tenor of the finance area varied considerably and it was
  small, rarely having more than a half dozen members at a time.
  But the quality of mind, diversity of thought, devotion to the
  subject of finance, and genuine affection for one another were
  reliable constants throughout those years.

  I see my research interests as fitting into three regimes of
  roughly equal lengths across time: 1968 to 1977, 1977 to 1987,
  and 1988 to the present, with a reflective year 1987-1988. The
  first period was my most productive one for basic research, in
  terms of both the number of papers produced and the originality
  and significance of contribution. The central modeling theme was
  continuous-time stochastic processes with
  continuous-decision-making by agents. Locating this modeling
  approach within mathematical economics, I see my models falling
  in the middle range between simple models (e.g., one or
  two-periods with a representative agent) designed to give
  insights (associated by some with the "M.I.T. School") and full
  general equilibrium models on a grand scale involving an
  arbitrary number of agents with general preferences and
  production technologies (often associated with the "Berkeley
  School"). Compared with discrete-time dynamic formulations, the
  continuous-time models are mathematically more complex. But by
  explicitly setting the trading interval and modeling the
  evolution of the system as diffusion processes, the derived
  results of the continuous-time models were often more precise and
  easier to interpret than their discrete-time counterparts. As a
  consequence, these theoretical models combined enough richness
  and tractability to be applied normatively for decisions in
  practice and positively in empirical tests. Of course, all models
  involve abstractions from complex reality. I see the relative
  importance of my contribution to be more in selecting "good"
  abstractions than in introducing and applying mathematical
  power.

  My first decade's research focus on developing dynamic models of
  optimal lifetime consumption and portfolio selection, equilibrium
  asset pricing, and contingent-claim pricing shifted in the
  1978-1987 period to applications of those models. A series of
  papers examined the various risk-bearing roles of pay-as-you-go
  and funded social security and defined-benefit,
  defined-contribution, and integrated private-sector pension
  plans. I also applied option-pricing theory to the valuation of
  deposit insurance, market-timing information, corporate
  investment decisions, and implicit labor contracts. I worked on
  models for estimating expected returns on the market portfolio,
  for fitting dividend and earnings behavior, and for testing of
  investor market-timing skills. A number of papers including my
  Presidential address to the American Finance Association examined
  the rationality of capital-market prices and the effects of
  market imperfections on equilibrium asset prices. With Stanley
  Fischer, I also wrote on issues common to macroeconomics and
  finance. Others whom I was fortunate to publish with during this
  period were Zvi Bodie, Mathew Gladstein, Roy Henriksson, Alan
  Marcus, Terry Marsh, Scott Mason and, for the first time, Myron
  Scholes. In contrast, during the prior decade, I had had only two
  co-authors: (three papers with) Paul Samuelson and (one with)
  Marti Subrahmanyam.

  In 1987, I took my first-ever sabbatical year to write a book
  based on my work in continuous-time finance. Peter Dougherty,
  then an editor at Basil Blackwell, had suggested a book nearly a
  year before that would use my previously published papers as the
  core. As it happened, I had been thinking about putting my ideas
  on the subject together and Peter's expressed interest served as
  a catalyst. M.I.T. graciously provided my full salary for the
  year and the Harvard Business School kindly offered an office in
  which to work. It was a most enjoyable and productive time. With
  no other commitments, I wrote nearly every day with no limit on
  length and no set deadline for either any piece or the whole.
  Earlier writings were corrected and, in some cases, significantly
  expanded. Five new chapters were created incorporating my
  cumulative thoughts in the fields of optimal portfolio selection,
  option pricing, financial intermediation, and general equilibrium
  theory. I even took pleasure in developing my own extensive index
  and bibliography.

  This reflective year was a watershed, both for my research and
  for where it would take place. In effect, Continuous-Time
  Finance was the crowning synthesis of my earlier work. Its
  Chapter 14 on intermediation and institutions, however,
  represented a bridge to a new direction of my research. From that
  time until the present, I have focused on understanding the
  financial system with special emphasis on the dynamics of
  institutional change. In particular, I am studying the role of
  financial technology and innovation in driving changes in
  financial institution and market design, the management of
  financial-service firms, and the regulatory and the accounting
  systems. There is, however, continuity of this line of inquiry
  with the past: Fischer's, Myron's and my derivative-security
  research provided much of the foundation for the contracting and
  security-design technology that is central to the extraordinary
  wave of real-world financial innovation of the past two
  decades.

  My decision to move from M.I.T. to the Harvard Business School in
  1988 was significantly influenced by this turn in my research
  interests. Although it was a difficult decision to make, I have
  never since doubted that it was the right one. Both the
  institution and my colleagues have treated me in extraordinary
  fashion. A prime exemplifying case: shortly after my joining the
  HBS faculty, then-Dean John McArthur resigned from the George
  Fisher Baker professorship in order to give it to me. Giving the
  name chair of the founding-sponsor of the School-known as the
  "Dean's Chair" since the beginning--to a newly arrived professor
  of mathematical finance who had not yet taught a single HBS
  student, was a towering symbol and statement of confidence and
  support. That recognition meant all the more to me because it was
  given after I had happily accepted the School's offer and this
  timing made it altogether clear that it was not part of any
  negotiation. Now, a decade later, I am especially pleased to
  become the first John and Natty McArthur University Professor and
  to have the Baker chair become once again the "Dean's
  Chair."

  For nearly a decade, I have enjoyed developing the new work on
  the financial system: to begin with, on my own, but then quite
  soon after, in a delightful, productive and multi-faceted
  collaboration with Zvi Bodie, professor of finance at Boston University, whom
  I have known since the early 1970s when he was a student in the
  M.I.T. department of economics. Together we have developed the
  idea of using a "functional" perspective to analyze and to
  predict financial institutional change over time and to provide a
  better understanding of contemporaneous institutional differences
  across geopolitical borders. Zvi and I have refined and applied
  this idea in a series of working papers, published articles, and
  book chapters. In 1992, Zvi and my HBS colleague and my former
  MIT student, Carliss Baldwin, led the way to the creation of the
  Global Financial System project at the Harvard Business School.
  The project which involves several of my finance colleagues (and
  Zvi) working together with senior management from 15 major global
  financial-service firms has considerably expanded the research
  effort devoted to applying the functional approach to the
  financial system and to the management of financial institutions.
  Whether published as jointly or singly authored, my work with Zvi
  in this area has always been collaborative. Conceived at the
  outset as a parallel development to our research, but completed
  only now, is our textbook on basic finance that applies this
  perspective and presents the subject as a set of principles much
  like first-courses in economics and the physical sciences.

  Throughout the last 30 years of academic research, I have been
  involved in finance practice. The vast bulk of my research has
  been in mathematical finance theory, but I believe that my
  involvement in practice has shaped that research and in turn has
  been shaped by it, this interplay to the benefit of both. A
  targeted instance can be found in the section of my 1973 rational
  option pricing paper on pricing and hedging the risk of the
  "down-and-out" call option. I became aware of such instruments in
  the early 1970s only as a consequence of a consulting assignment
  from a firm that was issuing them in Asia. In the decades since,
  the down-and-out option has become the prototype example of the
  exotic option, which is now a large, mainstream class of
  financial-product offerings.

  My first consulting experience was in 1969 for a southern
  California bank on the pricing of warrants. Ironically, had the
  "equal-yield-for-equal sigmarisk" model I developed ad hoc
  for them been taken to its continuous-trading limit, it would
  have led to the Black-Scholes pricing formula but of course
  without any of the rigorous foundation underlying that formula
  which includes the key hedging insight of Black and Scholes.
  Myron Scholes and I began working together on consulting projects
  shortly after I joined the Sloan faculty. In 1972, we were
  engaged by Mathew Gladstein of the options department of
  Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette to develop option pricing and
  hedging models for the over-the-counter market and later for the
  new Chicago Board Options Exchange. In 1973, Leo Pomerance, head
  of the DLJ options department, became the first chairman of the
  CBOE. Myron and I learned much from our DLJ experience and
  indeed, our first publications together in 1978 and 1982 evolved
  directly from a mutual-fund project which DLJ helped us to
  underwrite.

  As a consequence of the extraordinary decline in the stock market
  in 1973-74, Myron and I had an idea for a mutual-fund product
  that would provide significant downside protection to the
  investor while at the same time affording significant exposure to
  upside movements in the stock market. The strategy designed to do
  this was to purchase a diversified portfolio of call options with
  10 percent of the assets and to invest the balance of the assets
  in short-term money-market instruments, with those proportions
  rebalanced every 6 months. Since the strategy involved option
  buying instead of option writing, many cautioned us that the SEC
  might see it as "too speculative" for the first option-based
  mutual fund in the United States and thus, would create serious
  roadblocks. They were wrong: the staff of the SEC apparently
  understood the fund's relatively conservative design and approved
  it with essentially no delays. The strategy was thus implemented
  with the creation of Money Market/Options Investment, Inc., an
  open-ended mutual fund, which went effective in February 1976.
  The portfolio's subsequent performance fit the simulations
  projected for it. Nevertheless, and despite being a direct
  predecessor to the portfolio-insurance products of the 1980s and
  the various successful "floor" products offered around the globe
  in the 1990s, MM/OI was not a commercial success. Still, it was
  for us a broadening experience about the multi-dimensional
  aspects of setting up a new financial entity. As Myron is fond of
  observing, "Sometimes the early bird gets the worm ... and
  sometimes, it gets frozen."

  For the rest of the 1970s and much of 1980s, I kept my hand in
  practice, serving on a few mutual fund boards and being elected a
  trustee of College Retirement Equities Fund. During the early
  1980s, several of my former students from M.I.T., most of them
  Ph.D.s, were attracted to Salomon Brothers, the global investment
  bank, by John Meriwether and under his leadership, they helped
  build an enormously successful proprietary trading group focused
  on arbitrage in the fixed-income markets. The core financial
  technology used in the group was based on the
  Black-Scholes-Merton derivative-security models, but it was
  highly refined to take account of much greater empirical detail
  and practical market experience. In 1988, one of those former
  students, Eric Rosenfeld, and Thomas Strauss, then President of
  Salomon, came to see me about becoming a special consultant to
  the Office of the Chairman. They made me an offer I couldn't
  refuse: unlike the simple model-building/product-design role of
  my past consultancies, this one also called for a role as trusted
  advisor (with technical skills) to the CEO on business matters of
  the firm and on the direction of institutional change in the
  global financial system. One could hardly imagine a better fit to
  inform, and to be informed by, my then-new direction of research
  on the functional perspective. Over the next four years, I
  learned much about the operations and management of a global
  intermediary, and trust that I contributed something as well. I
  definitely strengthened old friendships with former students and
  developed new friendships with their colleagues, and Myron and I
  got back together in practice when he joined Salomon from
  Stanford.

  In early 1993, John Meriwether who had left Salomon in 1991, Eric
  Rosenfeld who had recently left and James McEntee, former
  chairman and cofounder of Carroll-McEntee, the primary
  government-bond dealer, and John's long-time friend, had the idea
  of building a new firm to undertake fixed-income arbitrage on a
  global basis. The thought of working with John and Eric once
  again and having a hand in building a large-scale financial firm
  from scratch was exciting and I immediately volunteered to help
  out.

  Over the ensuing months, one at a time, senior members of John's
  old group left Salomon and showed up ready to get involved in
  what became Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM): Victor Haghani
  arrived in the spring; Gregory Hawkins and Myron Scholes
  (bringing us back together in practice once again) in the summer;
  William Krasker in the fall; and Richard Leahy and Larry
  Hilibrand at year end. The last of the founders, David Mullins,
  who joined LTCM in late winter, never worked at Salomon. With a
  Ph.D. from M.I.T. and 15 years on the finance faculty at Harvard
  Business School before going into government service, he
  exemplifies the strong M.I.T. and HBS connections among the
  founders of LTCM: seven of the eleven founders (and nine of the
  current sixteen principals of the firm) were either graduates, or
  on their faculties, or both.

  This small group of founding principals, together with a few key
  early employees, put together and tested the financial,
  telecommunication, and computer technologies, hired the
  strategists and operations people to run them, designed the
  organizational structure of the business, executed the complex
  contractual agreements with investors and counterparties, found
  and outfitted physical quarters in both the United States and
  London, and helped to raise over $1 billion from investors. The
  design and development efforts along each of these dimensions
  attempted to marry the best of finance theory with the best of
  finance practice. It all came together in February 1994 when the
  firm began active business. Today, LTCM has 180 employees, a
  third office in Tokyo, and its capital has grown
  considerably.

  It was deliciously intense and exciting to have been a part of
  creating LTCM. For making it possible, I will never be able to
  adequately express my indebtedness to my extraordinarily talented
  LTCM colleagues.

  The distinctive LTCM experience from the beginning to the present
  characterizes the theme of the productive interaction of finance
  theory and finance practice. Indeed, in a twist on the more
  familiar version of that theme, the major investment magazine,
  Institutional Investor characterized the remarkable
  collection of people at LTCM as "The best finance faculty in the
  world. "

  In long retrospect, unexpected roads happily traveled.

How an MIT Professor and Nobel Laureate Thinks Retirement Will Change

by Garrett Brennan | Updated March 24, 2016 

Robert C. Merton, a Nobel laureate in Economics who helped change the financial industry with his work on the “Black Scholes formula”, has now suggested a solution for how the world is going to address retirement - through a product called a reverse mortgage.
In his speech to a crowded room of financial experts, Merton stated “this is the greatest thing since sliced bread for retirees [yet] no one is doing it.”
Dr. Merton is clearly excited about this financial instrument, but why? Is this MIT professor exaggerating the benefits of a reverse mortgage? If he is actually right, why aren’t more people taking advantage of them?
Why Does Merton Have Faith In Reverse Mortgages?
His argument starts with a simple truth – people are living longer.
For simplicity, let’s imagine that fifty years ago the average American used to work for 40 years and then retire for 10 years. Fast forward to today, what happens if the average retirement lasts for 20 years instead?

Scenario 1: 80% of the years go towards saving while 20% go towards spending.
Scenario 2: 67% of the years go towards saving while 33% go towards spending.

While that can seem frightening, Dr. Merton is quick to remind us that longevity is a blessing if planned for appropriately, “all of this is basically good, it’s just a challenge.”
Essentially it is a balance between consumption (standard of living), years worked, and financial creativity. The question becomes what are Americans doing to address that last point?
How Do We Get More Out of the Assets We Have?
If you are like most Americans, your house is the most valuable asset you own. A reverse mortgage allows you to tap into the equity already invested in your home. Here’s how it works:
A lender will offer you a loan in the form of a lump sum, monthly payment, line of credit, or any combination thereof. This money is tax-free and can be used to make home improvements, pay medical bills, enjoy a vacation, or whatever else, so long as you pay your usual home-related expenses and do not allow the home to significantly deteriorate.
In exchange, the loan accrues interest which only becomes payable once you pass away, move, or sell the home. It is important to note that even if the loan grows to become larger than the value of the house, you will not be required to repay any additional loan balance in excess of the value of the home.
Here is the best part. When the loan comes due, the bank’s only form of recourse is through the house. That means your debt can’t be extended to your heirs, your income, or anything other than the home itself. Here are the most common scenarios:
What if the house is worth more than the outstanding loan amount?
Great! You can sell the house, pay off the loan, and keep the difference.
What if the house is worth less than the outstanding loan amount?
You can allow the bank to take ownership of the house and walk away with the money you’ve borrowed.
What if I pass away? Will the debt be transferred onto my kids?
No. Your heirs will walk through the decision to either pay back the loan or sell the house depending on their preference. If they want, they can let the bank take the house guaranteeing they won’t have to pay anything out of pocket.
What Should I Know Before Taking The Next Step?
If you need extra cash through retirement and want to stay in your home, a reverse mortgage can be a brilliant option. Before applying you will be required to go through an independent consultation to confirm that a reverse mortgage is suitable for your financial situation.
Here are some basic facts to keep in mind when considering a reverse mortgage:

Reverse mortgages are FHA-insured loans
You or your co-borrower (typically a spouse) needs to be age 62 or above
You are borrowing against your home equity
You do not need to repay the loan as long as one of the borrowers is still living in the home
Reverse mortgages usually eliminate your ongoing mortgage payments
You can choose to receive a monthly payment, lump sum, or line of credit to use against the house (or even a combination thereof)
Reverse mortgages can be a welcome source of financial independence
It's essential to comparison shop multiple lenders as offers can vary widely

Keep in mind that this product is not for everyone. For example, if you want to move within a few years, you should consider a traditional refinance instead. LendingTree encourages you to arm yourself with information before making any decision.

Even if you have no intention of applying, knowing the offers available today can bring peace of mind if your circumstances change in the future.

401(k)s face ‘crisis,’ says Nobelist Merton

By Anne TergesenSince the dark days of 2008, employers have taken some steps to fix the 401(k), the backbone of the nation’s private retirement-savings system. But Nobel laureate Robert C. Merton says that in the rush to upgrade these plans, plan sponsors and administrators have overlooked one big problem: They are managing these plans with the wrong goal in mind.



Bloomberg News
Merton says a crisis is coming for 401(k) investors.


“The seeds of an investment crisis have been sown,” the MIT professor of finance writes in an article in the July-August issue of Harvard Business Review, which was published Tuesday. “The only way to avoid a catastrophe is for plan participants, professionals, and regulators to shift the mind-set and metrics from asset value to income,” writes Merton, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997.
In recent years, employers have tried to improve 401(k)s by introducing features such as automatic enrollment and products including target-date funds. But in his article and in a recent interview with Encore, Merton said these moves weren’t likely to be sufficient. To fix the 401(k), he argues, employers and the financial services companies that manage these plans must get past the ongoing obsession with two things: Account balances and annual returns. These metrics, Merton says, are far less important than one other: The amount of sustainable income an employee can expect to receive in retirement.
By disclosing annual income, instead of (or in addition to) an account balance, Merton says, employers will help employees quickly and easily calculate how much of their annual salary they can expect to replace in retirement, together with Social Security. As a result, employees will be better able to take action to ensure they are on track to retire as planned.
But that’s only half the battle. In order to accurately calculate how much retirement income a participant’s 401(k) balance will purchase, the plan sponsor must assume the money will be invested in an inflation-adjusted deferred annuity or long-term U.S. Treasury bonds. These investments, Merton writes, ensure “spendable income” that’s “secure for the life” of the bond or annuity and are “the very assets that are the safest from a retirement income perspective.”
That’s not to say that 401(k) money shouldn’t be invested in stocks. In fact, Merton says, 401(k) investment managers should invest participants’ savings in a mixture of “risky assets,” including equities, and “risk-free assets,” such as long-term U.S. Treasuries and deferred annuities. Moreover, the investment manager should shift the investment mix over time to optimize the likelihood of success.
Employers, he says, should begin by asking employees not about their tolerance for investment risk, but about their expectations for income needs in retirement.
If the investments are managed well, the employee – upon retirement—should have enough money to buy a deferred, inflation-indexed annuity that (together with Social Security) will replace his or her salary in retirement. Retirees who don’t want to buy an annuity don’t have to. But once they achieve their retirement income goal, he says, they’d be foolish to leave their money at risk in the stock market.
“Think of risk as a tool,” he writes. “When you don’t need it, get rid of as much of it as you can because it’s costly. When we take a risk, it’s generally for a good reason. You wouldn’t normally put yourself in harm’s way for no reason.”
Merton has also been working with mutual fund manager Dimensional Fund Advisors to turn his ideas about 401(k) reform into a commercially viable strategy. For more on those efforts see this recent Forbes article by Matt Schifrin.

Long-Term Capital Management LP


                  Long-Term Capital Management L.P. (LTCM) was a hedge fund management firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut that utilized absolute-return trading strategies combined with high financial leverage. The firm's master hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P., collapsed in the late 1990s, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998 among 14 financial institutions for a $3.6 billion recapitalization (bailout) under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.

LTCM was founded in 1994 by John W. Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. Members of LTCM's board of directors included Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for a "new method to determine the value of derivatives". Initially successful with annualized returns of over 40% (after fees) in its first years, in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months following the Russian financial crisis requiring financial intervention by the Federal Reserve, with the fund liquidating and dissolving in early 2000.

What’s in a Name?

Vical initially was formed by former Hybritech executives Howard Greene and Timothy Wollaeger and UCSD professors Karl Hostetler and Douglas Richman to explore the development of lipid-based delivery of antiVIrals and CALcitonin – hence VICAL. A surprise outcome in an experiment - in which the lipid-free control performed better than the test lipid - led to the discovery of the core technology behind all of Vical’s current programs. The Vical mission changed as a result, but the Vical name endured

Biography[edit]
Merton was born in New York City to a Jewish father[2] sociologist Robert K. Merton and mother Suzanne Carhart who was from a "multigenerational southern New Jersey Methodist/Quaker family."[3] He grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mathematics from the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University, a Masters of Science from the California Institute of Technology, and his doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970 under the guidance of Paul Anthony Samuelson. He then joined the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he taught until 1988.[4] Subsequently, Merton moved to Harvard University, where he was George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration from 1988 to 1998 and has held the John and Natty McArthur University Professorship since 1998. On June 11, 2010 it was announced[5] that Merton would retire from Harvard and rejoin the MIT Sloan School of Management. Merton also sits on the QFINANCE Strategic Advisory Board.
Career[edit]
Robert C. Merton is the School of Management Distinguished Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is resident scientist at Dimensional Fund Advisors, where he developed a next-generation integrated pension-management solution system that addresses deficiencies associated with traditional defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans. Merton is University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University. He was the George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration (1988–98) and John and Natty McArthur University Professor (1998–2010) at the Harvard Business School. He previously served on the finance faculty of the Sloan School from 1970 until 1988. Merton received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for expanding the Black-Scholes formula. He is past President of the American Finance Association, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His most notably recognised for his height, being an individual who is taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger (self-proclaimed).
Merton’s research focuses on finance theory including lifecycle finance, optimal intertemporal portfolio selection, capital asset pricing, pricing of options, risky corporate debt, loan guarantees, and other complex derivative securities. He has also written on the operation and regulation of financial institutions. Merton’s current academic interests include financial innovation and dynamics of institutional change, controlling the propagation of macro financial risk, and improving methods of measuring and managing sovereign risk. He is the author of, Continuous-Time Finance, and a co-author of Cases in Financial Engineering: Applied Studies of Financial Innovation; The Global Financial System: A Functional Perspective; Finance; and Financial Economics.
Merton has also been recognized for translating finance science into practice. He received the inaugural Financial Engineer of the Year Award from the International Association of Financial Engineers in 1993, which also elected him a Senior Fellow. Derivatives Strategy magazine named him to its Derivatives Hall of Fame as did Risk magazine to its Risk Hall of Fame. He also received Risk’s Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the field of risk management. A Distinguished Fellow of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance ('Q Group') and a Fellow of the Financial Management Association, Merton received the Nicholas Molodovsky Award from the CFA Institute.
His first professional association with a hedge fund came in 1968. His advisor at the time, Paul Samuelson, brought him on board Arbitrage Management Company (AMC), to join founder Michael Goodkin and chief executive Harry Markowitz. AMC is the first known attempt at computerized arbitrage trading. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart & Co. in 1971.[6] In 1993, Merton co-founded a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, which earned high returns for four years but later lost $4.6 billion in 1998 and was bailed out by a consortium of banks and closed out in early 2000. In 1997 he received the Nobel Prize for his contributions in Economics.
Personal life[edit]
Merton married June Rose in 1966. They separated in 1996. They have three children; two sons and one daughter.
Honours and awards[edit]

In 1993, Merton became a member of the U.S. United States National Academy of Sciences.
In 1997, Merton was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Myron Scholes for their work on stock options.[7]
In 1999, Merton was awarded a lifetime achievement award in mathematical finance.[8]
In 2005 the Baker Library at Harvard University opened The Merton Exhibit in his honor.[9]
In 2010, Merton received the Kolmogorov medal.[10]

Biography[edit]
Merton was born in New York City to a Jewish father[2] sociologist Robert K. Merton and mother Suzanne Carhart who was from a "multigenerational southern New Jersey Methodist/Quaker family."[3] He grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mathematics from the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University, a Masters of Science from the California Institute of Technology, and his doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970 under the guidance of Paul Anthony Samuelson. He then joined the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he taught until 1988.[4] Subsequently, Merton moved to Harvard University, where he was George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration from 1988 to 1998 and has held the John and Natty McArthur University Professorship since 1998. On June 11, 2010 it was announced[5] that Merton would retire from Harvard and rejoin the MIT Sloan School of Management. Merton also sits on the QFINANCE Strategic Advisory Board.
Career[edit]
Robert C. Merton is the School of Management Distinguished Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is resident scientist at Dimensional Fund Advisors, where he developed a next-generation integrated pension-management solution system that addresses deficiencies associated with traditional defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans. Merton is University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University. He was the George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration (1988–98) and John and Natty McArthur University Professor (1998–2010) at the Harvard Business School. He previously served on the finance faculty of the Sloan School from 1970 until 1988. Merton received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for expanding the Black-Scholes formula. He is past President of the American Finance Association, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His most notably recognised for his height, being an individual who is taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger (self-proclaimed).
Merton’s research focuses on finance theory including lifecycle finance, optimal intertemporal portfolio selection, capital asset pricing, pricing of options, risky corporate debt, loan guarantees, and other complex derivative securities. He has also written on the operation and regulation of financial institutions. Merton’s current academic interests include financial innovation and dynamics of institutional change, controlling the propagation of macro financial risk, and improving methods of measuring and managing sovereign risk. He is the author of, Continuous-Time Finance, and a co-author of Cases in Financial Engineering: Applied Studies of Financial Innovation; The Global Financial System: A Functional Perspective; Finance; and Financial Economics.
Merton has also been recognized for translating finance science into practice. He received the inaugural Financial Engineer of the Year Award from the International Association of Financial Engineers in 1993, which also elected him a Senior Fellow. Derivatives Strategy magazine named him to its Derivatives Hall of Fame as did Risk magazine to its Risk Hall of Fame. He also received Risk’s Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the field of risk management. A Distinguished Fellow of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance ('Q Group') and a Fellow of the Financial Management Association, Merton received the Nicholas Molodovsky Award from the CFA Institute.
His first professional association with a hedge fund came in 1968. His advisor at the time, Paul Samuelson, brought him on board Arbitrage Management Company (AMC), to join founder Michael Goodkin and chief executive Harry Markowitz. AMC is the first known attempt at computerized arbitrage trading. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart & Co. in 1971.[6] In 1993, Merton co-founded a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, which earned high returns for four years but later lost $4.6 billion in 1998 and was bailed out by a consortium of banks and closed out in early 2000. In 1997 he received the Nobel Prize for his contributions in Economics.
Personal life[edit]
Merton married June Rose in 1966. They separated in 1996. They have three children; two sons and one daughter.
Honours and awards[edit]

In 1993, Merton became a member of the U.S. United States National Academy of Sciences.
In 1997, Merton was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Myron Scholes for their work on stock options.[7]
In 1999, Merton was awarded a lifetime achievement award in mathematical finance.[8]
In 2005 the Baker Library at Harvard University opened The Merton Exhibit in his honor.[9]
In 2010, Merton received the Kolmogorov medal.[10]

Biography[edit]
Merton was born in New York City to a Jewish father[2] sociologist Robert K. Merton and mother Suzanne Carhart who was from a "multigenerational southern New Jersey Methodist/Quaker family."[3] He grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mathematics from the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University, a Masters of Science from the California Institute of Technology, and his doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970 under the guidance of Paul Anthony Samuelson. He then joined the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he taught until 1988.[4] Subsequently, Merton moved to Harvard University, where he was George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration from 1988 to 1998 and has held the John and Natty McArthur University Professorship since 1998. On June 11, 2010 it was announced[5] that Merton would retire from Harvard and rejoin the MIT Sloan School of Management. Merton also sits on the QFINANCE Strategic Advisory Board.
Career[edit]
Robert C. Merton is the School of Management Distinguished Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is resident scientist at Dimensional Fund Advisors, where he developed a next-generation integrated pension-management solution system that addresses deficiencies associated with traditional defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans. Merton is University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University. He was the George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration (1988–98) and John and Natty McArthur University Professor (1998–2010) at the Harvard Business School. He previously served on the finance faculty of the Sloan School from 1970 until 1988. Merton received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for expanding the Black-Scholes formula. He is past President of the American Finance Association, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His most notably recognised for his height, being an individual who is taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger (self-proclaimed).
Merton’s research focuses on finance theory including lifecycle finance, optimal intertemporal portfolio selection, capital asset pricing, pricing of options, risky corporate debt, loan guarantees, and other complex derivative securities. He has also written on the operation and regulation of financial institutions. Merton’s current academic interests include financial innovation and dynamics of institutional change, controlling the propagation of macro financial risk, and improving methods of measuring and managing sovereign risk. He is the author of, Continuous-Time Finance, and a co-author of Cases in Financial Engineering: Applied Studies of Financial Innovation; The Global Financial System: A Functional Perspective; Finance; and Financial Economics.
Merton has also been recognized for translating finance science into practice. He received the inaugural Financial Engineer of the Year Award from the International Association of Financial Engineers in 1993, which also elected him a Senior Fellow. Derivatives Strategy magazine named him to its Derivatives Hall of Fame as did Risk magazine to its Risk Hall of Fame. He also received Risk’s Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the field of risk management. A Distinguished Fellow of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance ('Q Group') and a Fellow of the Financial Management Association, Merton received the Nicholas Molodovsky Award from the CFA Institute.
His first professional association with a hedge fund came in 1968. His advisor at the time, Paul Samuelson, brought him on board Arbitrage Management Company (AMC), to join founder Michael Goodkin and chief executive Harry Markowitz. AMC is the first known attempt at computerized arbitrage trading. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart & Co. in 1971.[6] In 1993, Merton co-founded a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, which earned high returns for four years but later lost $4.6 billion in 1998 and was bailed out by a consortium of banks and closed out in early 2000. In 1997 he received the Nobel Prize for his contributions in Economics.

Biography[edit]
Merton was born in New York City to a Jewish father[2] sociologist Robert K. Merton and mother Suzanne Carhart who was from a "multigenerational southern New Jersey Methodist/Quaker family."[3] He grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mathematics from the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University, a Masters of Science from the California Institute of Technology, and his doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970 under the guidance of Paul Anthony Samuelson. He then joined the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he taught until 1988.[4] Subsequently, Merton moved to Harvard University, where he was George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration from 1988 to 1998 and has held the John and Natty McArthur University Professorship since 1998. On June 11, 2010 it was announced[5] that Merton would retire from Harvard and rejoin the MIT Sloan School of Management. Merton also sits on the QFINANCE Strategic Advisory Board.
Career[edit]
Robert C. Merton is the School of Management Distinguished Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is resident scientist at Dimensional Fund Advisors, where he developed a next-generation integrated pension-management solution system that addresses deficiencies associated with traditional defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans. Merton is University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University. He was the George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration (1988–98) and John and Natty McArthur University Professor (1998–2010) at the Harvard Business School. He previously served on the finance faculty of the Sloan School from 1970 until 1988. Merton received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for expanding the Black-Scholes formula. He is past President of the American Finance Association, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His most notably recognised for his height, being an individual who is taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger (self-proclaimed).
Merton’s research focuses on finance theory including lifecycle finance, optimal intertemporal portfolio selection, capital asset pricing, pricing of options, risky corporate debt, loan guarantees, and other complex derivative securities. He has also written on the operation and regulation of financial institutions. Merton’s current academic interests include financial innovation and dynamics of institutional change, controlling the propagation of macro financial risk, and improving methods of measuring and managing sovereign risk. He is the author of, Continuous-Time Finance, and a co-author of Cases in Financial Engineering: Applied Studies of Financial Innovation; The Global Financial System: A Functional Perspective; Finance; and Financial Economics.
Merton has also been recognized for translating finance science into practice. He received the inaugural Financial Engineer of the Year Award from the International Association of Financial Engineers in 1993, which also elected him a Senior Fellow. Derivatives Strategy magazine named him to its Derivatives Hall of Fame as did Risk magazine to its Risk Hall of Fame. He also received Risk’s Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the field of risk management. A Distinguished Fellow of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance ('Q Group') and a Fellow of the Financial Management Association, Merton received the Nicholas Molodovsky Award from the CFA Institute.
His first professional association with a hedge fund came in 1968. His advisor at the time, Paul Samuelson, brought him on board Arbitrage Management Company (AMC), to join founder Michael Goodkin and chief executive Harry Markowitz. AMC is the first known attempt at computerized arbitrage trading. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart & Co. in 1971.[6] In 1993, Merton co-founded a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, which earned high returns for four years but later lost $4.6 billion in 1998 and was bailed out by a consortium of banks and closed out in early 2000. In 1997 he received the Nobel Prize for his contributions in Economics.
Personal life[edit]
Merton married June Rose in 1966. They separated in 1996. They have three children; two sons and one daughter.
Honours and awards[edit]

In 1993, Merton became a member of the U.S. United States National Academy of Sciences.
In 1997, Merton was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Myron Scholes for their work on stock options.[7]
In 1999, Merton was awarded a lifetime achievement award in mathematical finance.[8]
In 2005 the Baker Library at Harvard University opened The Merton Exhibit in his honor.[9]
In 2010, Merton received the Kolmogorov medal.[10]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
