While the level of uncertainty and volatility has increased with the new administration in Washington, we are more optimistic about stock market returns in 2017 driven by faster economic growth (2.0%+ GDP) and faster growth in corporate profits. We are conservatively projecting that P/E ratios might move down slightly from 17.7 to 17.0-17.4 times 2017 earnings as the outlook has moved up moderately for both inflation and interest rates.  More upside might come from M&A."​Click here to see our entire January 2016 TANAKA Growth Fund Shareholder Letter.

Tackling a Pension Shortfall by Taking on Debt

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Need Help? Call 866-322-9842
Our customer service agents are the most specialized team of representatives in the industry. Call us toll free.


Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							Find My Tanaka Model Number						



							Look for the model number on your Tanaka product on a prominent, almost commercial-looking tag, which is usually located on the starter housing. You’ll find the serial number on a separate yellow tag, usually on the plastic engine housing.

Tanaka model numbers almost always follow this format: XXX-XXXX (2-3 letters then 3-5 numbers/letters).

Some examples of Tanaka model numbers include EHC-120, TCS-3401S, ST-1600, and TPE-270PF.

Still can’t find your model number? You can always check your owner’s manual, if you still have that laying around. If not, give us a call at (866) 802-6383 and we’d be happy to help you find it!						
 





							The Help You Need with Tanaka Equipment						

							So you have a Tanaka outboard motor that you need to tune up before your next fishing trip? Not only can we supply you the parts to get it running smoothly again, we can also guide you through the steps of removal and installation of those parts.

We carry thousands of Tanaka spare parts for just about every model they’ve released. 

If you require a new carburetor or blade for your hedge trimmer, we stock them. And if you just can’t go another camping season without your Tanaka generator in working condition, we have the spare parts to fix that up too. No matter what parts you need or what repair questions you have, the eReplacementParts website and community will help you get it done.

						Rave Reviews					

						Just a short note to let you know how pleased I am with your service. Over the past year I have used eReplacementParts for my Tanaka outboard, my Makita chainsaw and Rigid air compressor. All the parts were correct, well priced (including shipping) and arrived on schedule. Thanks...I've installed your website on my desktop for future use.								

						Norm C.

					Tough Tools				

					We’re betting that most of you have used a Tanaka product before, even if you weren’t aware of it at the time. Since the 1960s, Tanaka has made small-engines for boats, lawn equipment, and even bicycles. Their heads-down approach to innovation produces products with great reliability, value, run-time, and useability.  So next time you use a Tanaka product, take great pride in knowing you’re using something that’s ingrained in the history of modern-day tools.
