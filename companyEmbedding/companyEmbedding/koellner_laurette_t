Early life and education[edit]
Koellner was raised in Brooklyn, and attended college at the University of Central Florida (UCF).[4] She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Management from UCF in 1977, and an MBA from Stetson University in 1980.[7][8]
Career[edit]
McDonnell Douglas/Boeing[edit]
After earning her bachelor's degree in 1977, Koellner began work at McDonnell Douglas as a contract analyst.[9] She spent 19 years at McDonnell Douglas, with an end position of vice president of Internal Audit.[10] After the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger in 1997, she remained with Boeing, first as vice president and general auditor, before being named vice president and corporate controller in 1999.[11][12][13][14] In 2000, she was named the senior vice president of the Shared Services group.[15] From 2002-2004, she served as a member of the office of the chairman, as well as the company's chief administration and human resources officer (a position she held until 2004).[16][17][18] In 2004, Koellner was named the president of Connexion by Boeing, a position she held until 2006, when she was named the president of Boeing International.[19][20] She remained in this position until her retirement from Boeing in 2008.[21]
ILFC[edit]
In 2012, she was named executive chairman at the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), a subsidiary of AIG.[22] The newly created position made her the company's most senior executive, overseeing ILFC CEO Henri Courpron, following revelations that Courpron had been involved in a personal relationship with an employee.[2] As head of ILFC reporting to AIG CEO Robert Benmosche, she stepped down from AIG’s board of directors.[23] In 2012, she announced that she would step down once AIG’s planned sale of the unit was approved.[24] The sale to AerCap was completed in May 2014.[25]
Board positions[edit]
In 2003, she was elected to the board of directors of Sara Lee Corporation as the chairman of the audit committee.[26][27][28] When Sara Lee split into Hillshire Brands and Douwe Egberts, she maintained her board position until Hillshire merged with Tyson Foods.[29][30]
In 2009, she was elected the chairman of the audit committee on the board of directors at Celestica, Inc.[31][32] In 2009, she was also named an independent director of American International Group (AIG).[33][34] She remained in this position through AIG's repayment of its $182.5 billion in government loans.[35] In 2014 she was elected member of the Board of Directors for Papa Johns pizza, and in 2015 as a member of the Goodyear board.[36][37]
Advisory positions[edit]
Koellner serves on the Dean's Advisory Board of the UCF College of Business Administration, and has also served on the Board of Regents for the University of Portland.[38][39] She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[40]
Recognition[edit]
Koellner was inducted into the UCF College of Business Administration Hall of Fame in 2003.[41] In 2005, she received a Distinguished Alumnus Award from UCF.[7] In 2011, she received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Stetson University.[8] She has also been designated a "audit committee financial expert" by the New York Stock Exchange.[42] In 2014, she was featured in the book Trailblazers: The Women of The Boeing Company as the highest-ranking female in the history of the company.[43]

After earning her bachelor's degree in 1977, Koellner began work at McDonnell Douglas as a contract analyst.[9] She spent 19 years at McDonnell Douglas, with an end position of vice president of Internal Audit.[10] After the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger in 1997, she remained with Boeing, first as vice president and general auditor, before being named vice president and corporate controller in 1999.[11][12][13][14] In 2000, she was named the senior vice president of the Shared Services group.[15] From 2002-2004, she served as a member of the office of the chairman, as well as the company's chief administration and human resources officer (a position she held until 2004).[16][17][18] In 2004, Koellner was named the president of Connexion by Boeing, a position she held until 2006, when she was named the president of Boeing International.[19][20] She remained in this position until her retirement from Boeing in 2008.[21]
ILFC[edit]
In 2012, she was named executive chairman at the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), a subsidiary of AIG.[22] The newly created position made her the company's most senior executive, overseeing ILFC CEO Henri Courpron, following revelations that Courpron had been involved in a personal relationship with an employee.[2] As head of ILFC reporting to AIG CEO Robert Benmosche, she stepped down from AIG’s board of directors.[23] In 2012, she announced that she would step down once AIG’s planned sale of the unit was approved.[24] The sale to AerCap was completed in May 2014.[25]
Board positions[edit]
In 2003, she was elected to the board of directors of Sara Lee Corporation as the chairman of the audit committee.[26][27][28] When Sara Lee split into Hillshire Brands and Douwe Egberts, she maintained her board position until Hillshire merged with Tyson Foods.[29][30]
In 2009, she was elected the chairman of the audit committee on the board of directors at Celestica, Inc.[31][32] In 2009, she was also named an independent director of American International Group (AIG).[33][34] She remained in this position through AIG's repayment of its $182.5 billion in government loans.[35] In 2014 she was elected member of the Board of Directors for Papa Johns pizza, and in 2015 as a member of the Goodyear board.[36][37]
Advisory positions[edit]
Koellner serves on the Dean's Advisory Board of the UCF College of Business Administration, and has also served on the Board of Regents for the University of Portland.[38][39] She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[40]
Recognition[edit]
Koellner was inducted into the UCF College of Business Administration Hall of Fame in 2003.[41] In 2005, she received a Distinguished Alumnus Award from UCF.[7] In 2011, she received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Stetson University.[8] She has also been designated a "audit committee financial expert" by the New York Stock Exchange.[42] In 2014, she was featured in the book Trailblazers: The Women of The Boeing Company as the highest-ranking female in the history of the company.[43]

Early life and education[edit]
Koellner was raised in Brooklyn, and attended college at the University of Central Florida (UCF).[4] She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Management from UCF in 1977, and an MBA from Stetson University in 1980.[7][8]
Career[edit]
McDonnell Douglas/Boeing[edit]
After earning her bachelor's degree in 1977, Koellner began work at McDonnell Douglas as a contract analyst.[9] She spent 19 years at McDonnell Douglas, with an end position of vice president of Internal Audit.[10] After the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger in 1997, she remained with Boeing, first as vice president and general auditor, before being named vice president and corporate controller in 1999.[11][12][13][14] In 2000, she was named the senior vice president of the Shared Services group.[15] From 2002-2004, she served as a member of the office of the chairman, as well as the company's chief administration and human resources officer (a position she held until 2004).[16][17][18] In 2004, Koellner was named the president of Connexion by Boeing, a position she held until 2006, when she was named the president of Boeing International.[19][20] She remained in this position until her retirement from Boeing in 2008.[21]
ILFC[edit]
In 2012, she was named executive chairman at the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), a subsidiary of AIG.[22] The newly created position made her the company's most senior executive, overseeing ILFC CEO Henri Courpron, following revelations that Courpron had been involved in a personal relationship with an employee.[2] As head of ILFC reporting to AIG CEO Robert Benmosche, she stepped down from AIG’s board of directors.[23] In 2012, she announced that she would step down once AIG’s planned sale of the unit was approved.[24] The sale to AerCap was completed in May 2014.[25]
Board positions[edit]
In 2003, she was elected to the board of directors of Sara Lee Corporation as the chairman of the audit committee.[26][27][28] When Sara Lee split into Hillshire Brands and Douwe Egberts, she maintained her board position until Hillshire merged with Tyson Foods.[29][30]
In 2009, she was elected the chairman of the audit committee on the board of directors at Celestica, Inc.[31][32] In 2009, she was also named an independent director of American International Group (AIG).[33][34] She remained in this position through AIG's repayment of its $182.5 billion in government loans.[35] In 2014 she was elected member of the Board of Directors for Papa Johns pizza, and in 2015 as a member of the Goodyear board.[36][37]
Advisory positions[edit]
Koellner serves on the Dean's Advisory Board of the UCF College of Business Administration, and has also served on the Board of Regents for the University of Portland.[38][39] She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[40]
Recognition[edit]
Koellner was inducted into the UCF College of Business Administration Hall of Fame in 2003.[41] In 2005, she received a Distinguished Alumnus Award from UCF.[7] In 2011, she received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Stetson University.[8] She has also been designated a "audit committee financial expert" by the New York Stock Exchange.[42] In 2014, she was featured in the book Trailblazers: The Women of The Boeing Company as the highest-ranking female in the history of the company.[43]

Laurette Koellner is president of Boeing International and is a member of the company's Executive Council. In this role, Koellner oversees the company's international affairs and has leadership responsibilities for 20 Boeing in-country operations throughout the world. She was appointed to this position in April 2006. Before this appointment, Koellner was president of Connexion by Boeing�, the Boeing business that provided real-time, high-speed Internet services to commercial and executive transport aircraft and maritime vessels. She joined Connexion by Boeing in December 2004.Before that, Koellner was executive vice president of Internal Services for The Boeing Company. She led the Shared Services Group, directed human resources and all areas of company administration, and managed corporate international relationships with Africa, the Americas and Russia. Koellner also was responsible for labor relations, leadership development, diversity, the Boeing Leadership Center, corporate administration, corporate services, corporate contributions and global corporate citizenship.During 2002 and 2003, she served as a member of the Office of the Chairman and, during 2001 and 2002, she served as president of the Shared Services business unit. Shared Services provides products and services primarily inside Boeing, including global computing and network infrastructure, employee services and programs, travel, security, facilities, real estate, environmental affairs and nonproduction procurement, all of which provide competitive advantage.Koellner began her career in the aerospace industry in 1978, when she joined McDonnell Douglas as an analyst in contracts. She was promoted several times until 1986, when she was asked to manage contracts and pricing for the Missile Systems Company in Titusville, Florida. In that job, she led all negotiations with the Department of Defense, NASA and a variety of international governments for weapons systems and related products and services. In 1988, Koellner became business manager for the Tomahawk Cruise Missile Program and by 1989, she directed strategic and business planning. In 1990, she was asked to run the internal support and services operation for the Florida Missile Production facility.Koellner transferred to St. Louis in 1992, where she was responsible for structuring and managing the $1.2 billion overhead budget for McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in the wake of the A-12 contract termination. In 1994, she became director of the human resources division, responsible for all human resources and fire and security services in St. Louis. Koellner was promoted to vice president and general auditor of the corporation in 1996 and led internal audit, management control systems and the executive development program. She held this key position during the merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in 1997 and was selected to continue in that role for the newly merged company. In 1999, she was named vice president and corporate controller, and was responsible for financial and cost accounting, cost policy, companywide cost estimating, common business systems, insurance and risk management.Koellner earned her bachelor's degree in business management from the University of Central Florida and her master's in business from Stetson University in Deland, Florida. She holds a Certified Professional Contracts Manager designation from the National Contracts Management Association. In 2003, Koellner was inducted into the University of Central Florida's (UCF) College of Business Administration Hall of Fame; in 2005, she was presented with the university's Distinguished Alumnus Award.Koellner is a member of the board of directors of the Sara Lee Corporation. She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and serves on the UCF College of Business Administration Dean's Executive Council.Koellner was born Oct. 21, 1954, in Brooklyn, New York.

Early life and education[edit]
Koellner was raised in Brooklyn, and attended college at the University of Central Florida (UCF).[4] She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Management from UCF in 1977, and an MBA from Stetson University in 1980.[7][8]
Career[edit]
McDonnell Douglas/Boeing[edit]
After earning her bachelor's degree in 1977, Koellner began work at McDonnell Douglas as a contract analyst.[9] She spent 19 years at McDonnell Douglas, with an end position of vice president of Internal Audit.[10] After the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger in 1997, she remained with Boeing, first as vice president and general auditor, before being named vice president and corporate controller in 1999.[11][12][13][14] In 2000, she was named the senior vice president of the Shared Services group.[15] From 2002-2004, she served as a member of the office of the chairman, as well as the company's chief administration and human resources officer (a position she held until 2004).[16][17][18] In 2004, Koellner was named the president of Connexion by Boeing, a position she held until 2006, when she was named the president of Boeing International.[19][20] She remained in this position until her retirement from Boeing in 2008.[21]
ILFC[edit]
In 2012, she was named executive chairman at the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), a subsidiary of AIG.[22] The newly created position made her the company's most senior executive, overseeing ILFC CEO Henri Courpron, following revelations that Courpron had been involved in a personal relationship with an employee.[2] As head of ILFC reporting to AIG CEO Robert Benmosche, she stepped down from AIG’s board of directors.[23] In 2012, she announced that she would step down once AIG’s planned sale of the unit was approved.[24] The sale to AerCap was completed in May 2014.[25]

In 2003, she was elected to the board of directors of Sara Lee Corporation as the chairman of the audit committee.[26][27][28] When Sara Lee split into Hillshire Brands and Douwe Egberts, she maintained her board position until Hillshire merged with Tyson Foods.[29][30]
In 2009, she was elected the chairman of the audit committee on the board of directors at Celestica, Inc.[31][32] In 2009, she was also named an independent director of American International Group (AIG).[33][34] She remained in this position through AIG's repayment of its $182.5 billion in government loans.[35] In 2014 she was elected member of the Board of Directors for Papa Johns pizza, and in 2015 as a member of the Goodyear board.[36][37]
Advisory positions[edit]
Koellner serves on the Dean's Advisory Board of the UCF College of Business Administration, and has also served on the Board of Regents for the University of Portland.[38][39] She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[40]
Recognition[edit]
Koellner was inducted into the UCF College of Business Administration Hall of Fame in 2003.[41] In 2005, she received a Distinguished Alumnus Award from UCF.[7] In 2011, she received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Stetson University.[8] She has also been designated a "audit committee financial expert" by the New York Stock Exchange.[42] In 2014, she was featured in the book Trailblazers: The Women of The Boeing Company as the highest-ranking female in the history of the company.[43]

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
