NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the Santander Drive 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2013-5 notes:
    

      --$223,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$252,000,000 class A-2A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$252,000,000 class A-2B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$226,580,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$201,920,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$204,470,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$100,960,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$87,380,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Marginally Weaker Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2013-5 is 
      representative of subprime borrowers. While the weighted average (WA) 
      Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score (590) and internal loss forecasting score 
      (LFS; 563) are relatively consistent with the prior three transactions, 
      the 2013-5 pool has a higher concentration in the weaker LFS score 
      buckets.
    

      Higher Credit Enhancement (CE): The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard CE totals 45.80% for the class A 
      up from 43% in 2013-4 (not rated by Fitch) and 2013-3, and is higher for 
      the class B, C and D notes, but unchanged for the class E notes. The 
      higher CE in 2013-5 compensates for the marginally weaker pool, lower 
      excess spread, and the incorporation of the unhedged floating-rate class 
      A-2B notes.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      SCUSA's portfolio and 2010-2012 securitizations declined from prior 
      years, supported by the improving U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle 
      values elevating recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SCUSA recorded solid financial results recently 
      and has been profitable since 2007. Fitch rates Santander, majority 
      owner of SCUSA, 'BBB+/F2' with a Negative Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SCUSA demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitizations' delinquency and loss 
      performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SCUSA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to SDART 2013-5 to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses, showing a potential downgrade of 
      one or two categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could 
      experience downgrades of up to three or more rating categories, under 
      Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario. For both scenarios, the 
      senior tranche notes do not display negative rating sensitivities.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.

Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes

                            [Dow Jones & Company, Inc. · 2007-04-04] - The following is a press release  from Moody's Investors Service: Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes $1.2 Billion of Asset-Backed Securities Rated.
                        

                            New York,  April 04, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to the  notes issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1.
                        

                            This  is the first subprime auto loan securitization for 2007 and the first  public transaction for Drive Financial Services Inc. (successor to Drive Financial Services LP).
                        

                            The complete rating action is as follows:
                        


                                Issuer: Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1
                            

                                $204,000,000 5.324% Class A-1 Asset backed Notes, rated Prime-1
                            

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.

	Since July 2014, Santander Consumer USA Inc. has received civil subpoenas and civil investigative
	demands from various federal and state agencies, including from the U.S. Department of Justice under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and several state attorneys
	general, requesting the production of documents and communications that, among other things, relate to the origination, underwriting and securitization of auto loans for varying time periods since 2007. Investigations, proceedings or
	information-gathering requests that Santander Consumer USA Inc. is, or may become, involved in may result in adverse consequences to Santander Consumer USA Inc. including, without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties,
	injunctions, or other actions.

	U.S. Bank, National Association, as the indenture trustee, has provided the following
	information: Since 2014 various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs, primarily investors, have filed claims against U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under
	certain residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) trusts. The plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other RMBS trustees, including Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon
	and Wells Fargo. The complaints against U.S. Bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and assert causes of action based upon the
	trustees purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders
	of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.


	Currently U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple
	trusts as described above with the most substantial case being:

	BlackRock Balanced Capital Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National Association

	, No. 605204/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (class action alleging claims with respect to approximately 794
	trusts) and its companion case

	BlackRock Core Bond Portfolio et al v. U.S Bank National Association

	, No. 14-cv-9401 (S.D.N.Y.). Some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned Blackrock cases, as well as other trusts, are involved in
	actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than 100 trusts per case.


	There can be no assurance as to the outcome
	of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions
	were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs claims vigorously.

	reporting in Item 9A of the 2015 Form 10-K. Certain of these material weaknesses involve the failure of controls to operate effectively, resulting in misstatements in SC Holdings filed financial statements as of for the years ended

	Managements Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria



	 




	1.


	Santander Consumer USA Inc. (the Asserting Party) is responsible for Assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB as of and
	for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the Reporting Period). The transactions covered by this report include the Asserting Partys publicly offered registered SDART transactions consisting of auto loans (the
	Platform). See Appendix A.




	 




	2.


	The Asserting Party used the criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (See Appendix B) to assess the compliance with the applicable servicing criteria except for the following criteria
	which the Asserting Party determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Asserting Party with respect to the Platform: 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
	and 1122(d)(4)(xiii).




	 




	3.


	There were no external enhancements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.




	 




	4.


	With respect to servicing criterion, Item 1122(d)(1)(iii), some of the transactions included in the FY15 Regulation AB Platform require the Company to utilize a backup servicer when certain events, which are
	specified within the transaction agreements, occur. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, the events that would require a backup servicer as listed in the transaction documents did not occur, and therefore the requirement for a backup
	servicer does not apply.




	 




	5.


	With respect to servicing criterion Item 1122(d)(2)(i), we have engaged various vendors to serve as repositories for customer payments (i.e., a lockbox bank and a third-party money wire transfer provider).
	Similarly, with respect to Item 1122(d)(4)(i), we have also outsourced maintenance and safeguarding of the titling and registering of the vehicles through online services made available by the motor vehicle administrations in various states to
	DealerTrack Collateral Management Services, a third party vendor that did not provide an Item 1122 (d) attestation report. We have determined that none of these vendors are a servicer as defined in Item 1101 (j) of
	Regulation AB, and we elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criteria applicable to each such vendor as permitted by the SECs Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
	Servicers (C&DI 200.06),formerly SEC Manual Telephone Interpretation 17.06. We have policies and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that each vendors activities comply in all material respects with the
	servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Asserting Party has taken responsibility for assessing compliance with regards to C&DI 200.06 with the portion of the servicing criterion performed by those vendors. We are solely responsible for
	determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria.




	 




	6.


	The Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.




	 




	7.


	The Asserting Party has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of non-compliance by the vendors with regard to the applicable servicing criteria, or performance of certain functions with regard to the
	servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.









	8.


	The Asserting Party has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the vendors with the applicable servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended
	December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.




	 




	9.


	Deloitte & Touche LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Asserting Partys assessment of compliance with all the applicable servicing criteria as of
	December 31, 2015 and for the Reporting Period.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	The Audit Committee of Santander Consumer USA Inc.


	Dallas,
	Texas


	We have examined managements assertion, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation
	AB Servicing Criteria, that Santander Consumer USA Inc. (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation AB for SCUSAs publicly offered
	registered SDART transactions consisting of auto loans (the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
	1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to managements assertion identifies the individual asset-backed
	transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assertion about the
	Companys compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.


	Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Companys compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing
	activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
	circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed
	transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
	reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Companys compliance with the servicing
	criteria.


	As described in managements assertion for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities
	required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
	compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by the SECs

	Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers

	(C&DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual Telephone
	Interpretation 17.06). As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the
	servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no
	procedures with respect to the Companys determination of its eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06.





	In our opinion, managements assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable
	servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

	Exhibit 34.2



	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


	The Board of Directors


	U.S. Bank National Association


	We have examined managements assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S.
	Bank National Association (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities
	Platform (the Platform), for which the Company provides trustee, registrar, paying agent and securities administration services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122
	(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122 (d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Companys
	compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assertion about the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.


	Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by
	the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Companys compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we
	considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the
	Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
	servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
	amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122 (d)(1)(ii), 1122 (d)(1)(v),
	and 1122 (d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that our examination
	provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria.


	In our opinion, managements assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
	December 31, 2015, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Amended and Restated 

Trust Agreement
(2013-2) 






The Owner Trustee is hereby authorized to engage
in the foregoing activities on behalf of the Issuer. Neither the
Issuer nor the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer shall engage
in any activity other than in connection with the foregoing or
other than as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents.

SECTION 2.4. Appointment of the
Owner Trustee. The Seller hereby appoints the Owner Trustee as
trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof, to have all
the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

SECTION 2.5. Initial Capital
Contribution of Trust Estate . As of the date of the Original
Trust Agreement, the Seller sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed
and set over to the Owner Trustee the sum of $1. The Owner Trustee
hereby acknowledges receipt in trust from the Seller, as of such
date, of the foregoing contribution, which shall constitute the
initial Trust Estate and shall be deposited in the Collection
Account.

SECTION 2.6. Declaration of
Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the
Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth
herein for the use and benefit of the Residual Interestholder,
subject to the obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction
Documents. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the
Issuer constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust
Statute and that this Agreement constitute the governing instrument
of such statutory trust. It is the intention of the parties hereto
that, solely for federal income or state and local income,
franchise and value added tax purposes, so long as there is a
single beneficial owner of the Residual Interest, the Issuer will
be disregarded as an entity separate from such beneficial owner and
the Notes will be characterized as debt. The parties agree that,
unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, the
Issuer will not file or cause to be filed annual or other necessary
returns, reports and other forms consistent with the
characterization of the Issuer as an entity separate from its
owner. In the event that the Issuer is deemed to have more than one
beneficial owner for federal income tax purposes, the Issuer will
file returns, reports and other forms consistent with the
characterization of the Issuer as a partnership (that is not
treated as a publicly traded partnership), and this Agreement shall
be amended to include such provisions as may be required under
Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall have all
rights, powers and duties set forth herein and, to the extent not
inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory Trust Statute with respect
to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer. The Owner Trustee has
heretofore filed the Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as required by Section 3810(a)
of the Statutory Trust Statute, such filing hereby being ratified
and approved in all respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in
the Statutory Trust Statute to the contrary, it is the intention of
the parties hereto that the Issuer constitute a “business
trust” within the meaning of Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

SECTION 2.7. Organizational
Expenses; Liabilities of the Holders .

(a) The Servicer shall pay
organizational expenses of the Issuer as they may arise.

Trust Agreement
(2013-2) 







(b) No Residual Interestholder
(including the Seller if the Seller becomes a Residual
Interestholder) shall have any personal liability for any liability
or obligation of the Issuer.

SECTION 2.8. Title to the Trust
Estate . Legal title to all the Trust Estate shall be vested at
all times in the Issuer as a separate legal entity.

SECTION 2.9. Representations and
Warranties of the Seller . The Seller hereby represents and
warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

(a) Existence and Power . The
Seller is a Delaware limited liability company validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has,
in all material respects, full power and authority required to own
its assets and operate its business as presently owned or operated,
and to execute, deliver and to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The Seller has
obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction
where the failure to do so would materially and adversely affect
the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents and the Underwriting Agreement.

(b) Authorization and No
Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by the
Seller of each Transaction Document to which it is a party and the
Underwriting Agreement (i) have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of the Seller and (ii) do not
violate or constitute a default under (A) any applicable law,
rule or regulation, (B) its organizational instruments or
(C) any material agreement or instrument to which the Seller
is a party or by which its properties are bound (other than
violations of such laws, rules, regulations or agreements which do
not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of such
agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by,
or the Seller’s ability to perform its obligations under, the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

(c) No Consent Required . No

obtained and filings which have previously been made and
(ii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not
obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under the
Underwriting Agreement or the Transaction Documents to which it is
a party.

(d) Binding Effect . Each of
the Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a party and the
Underwriting Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Seller enforceable against the Seller in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and, if applicable the

Documents, (ii) seek to prevent the issuance of the Notes or
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this

SECTION 3.1. Initial
Ownership . Upon the formation of the Issuer and until the
issuance of the Certificate, the Seller shall be the sole
beneficiary of the Issuer, and upon the issuance of the
Certificate, the Seller will no longer be a beneficiary of the

Certificateholder.

SECTION 3.2. Authorization of the
Certificates . Concurrently with the sale of the Transferred
Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
the Owner Trustee shall cause the Certificates to be executed on

SECTION 3.4. Registration of the
Certificates . The Owner Trustee shall maintain at its office
referred to in Section 2.2 , or at the office of any
agent appointed by it and approved in writing by the Residual
Interestholder at the time of such appointment, a register for the
registration and transfer of any Certificate.

SECTION 3.5. Transfer of the
Certificate .

(a) The Certificateholder may
assign, convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title
and interest in the Certificate; provided , that
(i) the Owner Trustee and the Issuer receive an Opinion of
Counsel stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, such transfer
will not cause the Issuer to be treated as a publicly traded
partnership for federal income tax purposes and (ii) the
Certificate may not be acquired by or for the account of or with
any assets of a Benefit Plan or any governmental, non-U.S., church
or any other employee benefit plan or retirement arrangement that
is subject to Similar Law; provided that the condition set
forth in (i)  above will not apply to a transfer of
100% of the Certificate or Certificates to an Affiliate of the
Seller or its designated nominee, provided such Affiliate shall
certify in writing to the Owner Trustee that it is a C Corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (within the meaning of
Section 1361(a)(2) of the Code) or a disregarded entity 100%
owned (directly or indirectly) by a C Corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (within the meaning of Section 1361(a)(2)
of the Code). By accepting and holding a Certificate (or any
interest therein), the holder thereof shall be deemed to have
represented and warranted that it is not, and is not purchasing the
Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of or with any
assets of, a Benefit Plan or any governmental, non-U.S., church or
any other employee benefit plan or retirement arrangement that is
subject to Similar Law. The Owner Trustee shall have no duty to
independently determine that the requirement in (ii)
 above is met and shall incur no liability to any person in
the event the holder of the Certificate does not comply with such
restrictions. Subject to the transfer restrictions contained herein
and in the Certificate, the Certificateholder may transfer all or
any portion of the beneficial interest in the Issuer evidenced by
such Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee
accompanied by the documents required by this Section. Such
transfer may be made by the registered Certificateholder in person
or by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the
Certificate to the Owner Trustee accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer and with such signature guarantees and
evidence of authority of the Persons signing the instrument of
transfer as the Owner Trustee may reasonably require. Promptly upon
the receipt of such documents and receipt by the Owner Trustee of
the transferor’s Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record
the name of such transferee as a Certificateholder and its
percentage of beneficial interest in the Issuer in the Certificate
register and issue, execute and deliver to such Certificateholder a
Certificate evidencing such beneficial interest in the Issuer. In
the event a transferor transfers only a portion of its beneficial
interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee shall register and issue
to such transferor a new Certificate evidencing such
transferor’s new percentage of beneficial interest in the
Issuer. Subsequent to a transfer and upon the issuance of the new
Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and
destroy the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such
transfer. The Owner Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any
Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the beneficial
interest in the Issuer evidenced by such Certificate.

(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.5 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be
obligated to register any transfer of a Certificate unless each of
the transferor and the transferee have certified to the Owner
Trustee that such transfer does not violate any of the transfer
restrictions stated herein including, but not limited to clauses
(d)  and (e)  of this Section 3.5
. The Owner Trustee shall not be liable to any Person for
registering any transfer based on such certifications.

(d) No transfer (or purported
transfer) of all or any part of a Certificateholder’s
interest (or any economic interest therein), whether to another
Certificateholder or to a person who is not a Certificateholder,
shall be effective, and any such transfer (or purported transfer)
shall be void ab initio , and no person shall
otherwise become a Certificateholder if, after such transfer (or
purported transfer), the Issuer would have more than 95 direct or
indirect holders of an interest in the Certificates and the
Non-Investment Grade Notes (unless, with respect to the
Non-Investment Grade Notes, a Debt-For-Tax Opinion has been
delivered). For purposes of determining whether the Issuer will
have more than 95 holders of an interest in the Certificates and
the Non-Investment Grade Notes, as applicable, each Person
indirectly owning an interest through a partnership (including any
entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes), a
grantor trust or an S corporation (each such entity, a “
flow-through entity ”) shall be treated as a
Certificateholder or Noteholder, as applicable, unless the Seller
determines in its sole and absolute discretion, after consulting
with qualified tax counsel, that less than substantially all of the
value of the beneficial owner’s interest in the flow-through
entity is attributable to the flow-through entity’s interest
(direct or indirect) in the Issuer.

(e) No transfer shall be permitted
if the same is effected through an established securities market or
secondary market or substantial equivalent thereof within the
meaning of Section 7704 of the Code or would make the Issuer
ineligible for “safe harbor” treatment under
Section 7704 of the Code.

(f) Each transferee (i) shall
be required to represent and warrant that it is a Person who is a
U.S. Tax Person and (ii) shall provide a certification of
non-foreign status, in such form as may be requested by the Seller
or the Owner Trustee (e.g. IRS Form W-9), signed under penalties of
perjury (and such other certification, representations or opinion
of counsel as may be requested by the Seller or the Owner
Trustee).

SECTION 3.6. Lost, Stolen,
Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates . If (i) any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Owner Trustee, or (ii) the
Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that any
Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of
ownership

Amended and Restated 

Trust Agreement
(2013-2) 






satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with
such security or indemnity as may be requested by the Owner Trustee
to save it harmless, the Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver a
new Certificate for the same percentage of beneficial interest in
the Issuer as the Certificate so mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen, of like tenor and bearing a different issue number, with
such notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee shall determine. Upon
the issuance of any new Certificate under this
Section 3.6 , the Issuer or Owner Trustee may require
the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer or exchange of the Certificate and any other reasonable
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer
and the Owner Trustee) connected therewith. Any duplicate
Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall
constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the
Issuer, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

SECTION 3.7. Appointment of the
Certificate Paying Agent . The Certificate Paying Agent shall
make distributions to Residual Interestholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and
the Servicer; provided , however , that no such
reports shall be required so long as the Seller or an affiliate of
the Seller is the sole Residual Interestholder. Any Certificate
Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from
the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making the
distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such
power and remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee
determines in its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent
shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement
in any material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent shall
initially be Deutsche Bank, and any co-paying agent chosen by the
Certificate Paying Agent. Deutsche Bank shall be permitted to
resign as Certificate Paying Agent upon thirty
(30) days’ written notice to the Owner Trustee. If
Deutsche Bank shall no longer be the Certificate Paying Agent, the
Owner Trustee shall appoint a successor to act as Certificate
Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Owner
Trustee shall cause such successor Certificate Paying Agent or any
additional Certificate Paying Agent appointed by the Owner Trustee
to execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which
such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate
Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner Trustee that as Certificate
Paying Agent, such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional
Certificate Paying Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it
for payment to the Residual Interestholders in trust for the
benefit of the Residual Interestholders entitled thereto until such
sums shall be paid to such Residual Interestholders. The
Certificate Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the
Owner Trustee and upon removal of a Certificate Paying Agent such
Certificate Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its
possession to the Owner Trustee. The rights, protections,
indemnities and immunities of the Owner Trustee under this
Agreement shall apply to the Owner Trustee also in its role as
Certificate Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar for so long as
the Owner Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying Agent or
Certificate Registrar and, to the extent applicable, to any other
paying agent, certificate registrar or authenticating agent
appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless
the context requires otherwise.

have no duty to give such written consent to a Bankruptcy Event by

refrain from taking any action if such action or inaction would be
contrary to any obligation of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee under
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or would be
contrary to Section 2.3 , nor shall the Owner Trustee
be obligated to follow any such direction, if given.

SECTION 4.5. Majority Control
. To the extent that there is more than one Residual
Interestholder, any action which may be taken or consent or

any duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee
hereunder or under any Transaction Document, and the Owner Trustee

this Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is

Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within ten
days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as
