These professionals specialize in legal matters that concern older adults and their family caregivers, but it is important to remember that all individuals will face these concerns at some point in their lives. It is never too early to begin planning for your future.Learn about:Elder Law ServicesHow to Pay for an Elder Law AttorneyElder Law Attorney CostsTo find an elder law attorney near you, search the AgingCare.com Elder Law Attorney Directory.

Some elder law lawyers may pursue further specialization in certain areas like Medicaid planning, but the table below shows the most common legal documents and goals that these professionals assist clients with.Fields of LawDocuments and ObjectivesHealth Care DecisionsMedical Power of Attorney (POA)/ Health Care ProxyAdvance DirectiveLiving WillPhysician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)Financial and Benefits PlanningFinancial Power of Attorney (POA)Medicaid PlanningRetirement PlanningSpecial Needs PlanningEstablishment of trusts for eligibility purposesEstate PlanningWill PreparationEstate Tax and Probate PlanningAdministration of formal probate processesSpecial Needs PlanningEstablishment of different types of trustsOther Legal ServicesGuardianship and Conservatorship MattersHow to Pay for an Elder Law AttorneyLegal counsel is paid for privately. For some low-income individuals who cannot afford to hire professional assistance, local area agencies on aging (AAAs), state bar associations and charitable organizations may be able to provide funding for these services or a referral to a provider that might be able to help. Eligible veterans may be able to receive pro bono legal help as well.All of the sources below can be used to pay for or receive elder law services:Life Settlements, Life Insurance PoliciesReverse MortgagesArea Agencies on Aging (AAAs)AnnuitiesBridge LoansU.S. Department of Veterans AffairsElder Law Attorney FeesCharges for legal services can vary widely depending on the nature and extent of the services needed and the expertise of the attorney. Larger cities have a higher cost of living, and this can cause legal fees to be higher in areas like Boston and Chicago. Some attorneys charge by the hour for certain services but use flat fees for others. Professionals who have been practicing and studying law for many years and who specialize in particular areas will generally charge more than a younger lawyer who is still working on building their practice.Find Care In Your AreaEnter a location Select a categoryIn-Home CareAssisted LivingIndependent LivingMemory CareNursing HomesAdult Day CareElder Law AttorneysFuneral HomesGeriatric Care ManagersHospiceCemeteriesPopular CitiesAtlanta, GABoca Raton, FLBoston, MAChicago, ILDenver, COGarden City, NYHouston, TXIndianapolis, INJacksonville, FLNew York, NYOverland Park, KSPhoenix, AZPittsburgh, PARaleigh, NCRockville, MDSalem, MASan Antonio, TXSarasota, FLSeattle, WASpokane, WASt Louis, MOTampa, FLVirginia Beach, VAWhite Plains, NYWorcester, MASelect a StateAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingChoosing an Elder Law AttorneyWhen selecting someone to help you compose important legal documents, it is important to have a good working relationship and confidence in their abilities and ideas.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)A Place for MomThe Best Communities Near YouGet Pricing, Feedback and Guidancewww.aplaceformom.comFight Alzheimer'sSpeak to an AdvisorSee ReviewsGet Community PricingComfort Keepers®In-Home Care & Living Assistance.Find a Comfort Keepers® Near You.www.ComfortKeepers.comSenior Care Funding PlansFind A Local OfficeIn-Home Care AssessmentIn-Home Care ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Granger Villa Inc800 N Commerce StGranger, TX 76530(512) 859-2800Nursing & Convalescent HomesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Granger Villa Inc800 N Highway 95Granger, TX 76530(512) 859-2800Residential Care FacilitiesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Custom Health Care Inc102 E Ash StGranger, TX 76530(512) 859-2574Home Health ServicesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collectionPREFERRED4. ResCare HomeCareFind a Location(800) 579-7967Home Health ServicesWebsiteContact UsMore InfoFrom Business: ResCare HomeCare provides personalized non-medical home care services to people of all ages, physical conditions and cognitive abilities.
