ELM Advisors | About us 























ELM Advisors
About Us
The savvy of the big investment firms.
The personal service of a family business.
ELM Advisors has the investment know how of the financial giants. Because that’s our background. We’re Lorne Abramson and Elana Lieberman, the principals of ELM Advisors. We started as securities analysts, evaluating investments for both institutional and private clients. Eventually, we both also became portfolio managers.
Later, we had the idea to combine the resources of the major firms in a much more personal way. So we joined with Elana’s father Mark at Smith Barney and together we formed the ELM Group, named for our initials. In 2005, we decided we could focus more directly on our clients’ needs by being independent, so we left and formed ELM Advisors.
Today, we’re married and have two children, Alec and Molly. We think that’s almost as important as our 40 collective years of experience in portfolio management, securities analysis and financial planning. Because being a family ourselves helps us truly understand the financial challenges you and your family face every day.

ELM Advisors | Financial planning 























ELM Advisors
Financial planning
Managing wealth.
So all the parts add up to a greater whole.
Financial planning is about more than just managing a portfolio. It’s the knowledge to make all your financial pieces fit and work together. Unlike many portfolio managers, we provide both independent investment and financial advice—for a single fee. And we’ll team up with your other advisors—including accountants, attorneys, bankers and insurers to make sure everything works in tandem. Wealth management at ELM is a valuable asset for all your assets. Not just your portfolio.
Client story: Planning for tomorrow
A couple in their 50s came to us with 401k plans from existing employers, IRAs from old jobs and a trust, held at multiple custodians. They didn’t know how much to contribute to their 401k plans or their child’s education fund. But they had one big question: Did they have enough to retire on? And if not, how much would they need?
We looked at all their assets and created a plan to simplify the answer. We consolidated their many accounts into a few low-cost, diversified portfolios that all work together—even with the accounts we didn’t manage ourselves. Then, using state-of-the-art modeling software and years of experience, we estimated how much they would need to retire including how much they should contribute to their 401k plans. We also helped them understand and set up a 529 college savings plan. And we conferred with their attorney to make sure their trust titling and and retirement plan beneficiaries were buttoned down. Now they have reasonable expectations for retirement. And a plan to reach them.

ELM Advisors | Our approach 























ELM Advisors
Our approach
Plan actively. Invest passively.
Sleep peacefully.
Managing assets can seem bewildering and overwhelming. We simplify the process down to what is really important. And never take our eye off the ball.
We offer peace of mind through proven principles. Minimize risk by spreading assets over a diversified range of investments. Maximize returns by keeping tax impact and costs low. Remain steady when the market is anything but.
We believe that low-cost, passively-managed equity index and asset class funds combined with high-quality, investment-grade bond ladders and broadly diversified, low cost bond funds are the cornerstone of a strategy to achieve these goals. And yours.
How we work with you:
We’re a small, family-owned firm that provides independent investment and financial advice. We’ve chosen Fidelity Investments to act as the institutional brokerage firm and custodian for our client assets. We believe this gives you the best combination of personal service and the resources of one of the world’s largest financial services companies.
Our compensation is on a fee basis, as a percentage of assets. Which means our interests align with yours and the long-term growth and sustainability of your assets.

ELM Advisors | Portfolio management 























ELM Advisors
Portfolio management
The right eggs. In the right baskets.
We’ll look at your individual situation. And then help you find an appropriate asset allocation—which assets to include, in what proportions and in what accounts.
We favor a broad range of investments to minimize risk. Low-fee, tax-smart index and passive asset class funds to keep costs and taxes low. Ladders of high-quality, investment-grade bonds or bond index funds for fixed income. And a consistent approach that’s weathered bull and bear markets. Because evidence shows that a diversified portfolio with low turnover can provide excellent risk-adjusted after tax returns over the long term.
What you’ll get is a portfolio designed just for you. But based on principles that have been proven by many.
Client story: Simplifying the Complex
Married clients in their 60s came to us with a trust and two IRAs—each invested in an assortment of actively-managed, higher-cost mutual funds. They couldn’t keep track of how much was in stock, bonds or what kinds of investments they were. And they didn’t realize many of the funds had overlapping positions and high ongoing expenses—both investment and tax expenses.
We immediately saw that they had too many investments, yet not enough diversification. We went to work to reduce their risk and their expenses. Being sensitive to realized gains in their taxable accounts, we moved their higher-cost mutual funds into broadly diversified, tax-sensitive, low cost index funds. We also added low cost municipal bond funds to improve their after-tax return. For their IRAs, we created a taxable bond ladder that would meet future distribution requirements in retirement. And we took advantage of the IRAs’ tax deferred status by placing less tax favored securities here. The result was a plan that reduced costs, minimized risk and eliminated confusion. While enhancing their peace of mind.

ELM Advisors | About us 























ELM Advisors
About Us
The savvy of the big investment firms.
The personal service of a family business.
ELM Advisors has the investment know how of the financial giants. Because that’s our background. We’re Lorne Abramson and Elana Lieberman, the principals of ELM Advisors. We started as securities analysts, evaluating investments for both institutional and private clients. Eventually, we both also became portfolio managers.
Later, we had the idea to combine the resources of the major firms in a much more personal way. So we joined with Elana’s father Mark at Smith Barney and together we formed the ELM Group, named for our initials. In 2005, we decided we could focus more directly on our clients’ needs by being independent, so we left and formed ELM Advisors.
Today, we’re married and have two children, Alec and Molly. We think that’s almost as important as our 40 collective years of experience in portfolio management, securities analysis and financial planning. Because being a family ourselves helps us truly understand the financial challenges you and your family face every day.
