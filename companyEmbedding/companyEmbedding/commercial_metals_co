Welcome to Commercial Metals
Commercial Metals Ltd was established in 1968 and operates as a
family owned business from 324 Neilson Street, Penrose. During our
history, we have earned a solid reputation as a professional recycling
facility, conducting business with reliability, integrity and
enthusiasm whilst providing competitive pricing for both our domestic
and commercial customers. We are able to provide on-site bins with
exchange on 24 hours notice, offer spot prices and co-ordinated removal
on specific projects, and can provide tender submission for ongoing
term contracts. We have an excellent customer base, and are constantly
looking to expand our operations through the development of
relationships with new local and international customers.
We are more than happy to take the time to meet potential local
clients and discuss their metal recyling needs in person, and can offer
prices upon request.
In New Zealand the manufacturing industry has been a good recycler.
In recent years, with growing community awareness of the benefits of
recycling, the industry has made even greater efforts. Scrap metal
comes from a variety of sources including scrap from off-cuts generated
by manufacturers and metal locked up in items that have come to the end
of their useful lives. Metal is always useful and can be infinitely
recycled with out degradation of product.
The primary function at Commercial Metals Ltd is the collection and
processing of ferrous and non ferrous metals. The recovery of scrap
metals is an integral part of the recycling loop, and helps to conserve
our country’s valuable natural resources. Recent research of commercial
construction waste found that more than 90% of steel was recycled.
However, demand for steel products greatly outstrips supply from
recycled sources, so all recycled material will be used. What is
crucial to sustainability for steel is the level of recycling at the
end of life.
At Commercial Metals Ltd we work to convert scrap metals into the
raw materials that other industries require to produce and manufacture
new products.
We operate a modern, efficent and professional scrap metal
recycling yard that supplies to both domestic and international
markets. As a member of the Scrap Metal Recycling Association of New
Zealand we are committed to raising the standards within our industry
and educating as to the important role that scrap metal recycling plays
in helping to preserve our environment. Our friendly staff are highly
skilled, and our combined experience allow us to ensure that the job is
done right the first time, whilst offering our customers the assurance
of stability, honesty and all the benefits of an on-going service.
Metals are seperated into one of two basic grades which are
referred to in the scrap metal recycling industry as ferrous and
nonferrous metals. Once a metal has been indentified as one of these
types, it is then further categorized into more specific grades for
processing. We grade and process our metals according to international
specifications which determine the price of the metal at the time of
purchase. Please note that prices are regularly subject to change as
dictated by the fluctuations in the world market and the NZD/USD
exchange rate.
