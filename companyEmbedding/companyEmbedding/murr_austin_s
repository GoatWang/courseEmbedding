Murr Files Legislation to Relocate the Public Integrity Unit 


by: Rep. Murr, Andrew
03/03/2015
Austin: Today, State Representative Andrew Murr (House District 53) filed a comprehensive bill to relocate the duties and responsibilities of the Public Integrity Unit, currently housed within the Travis County District Attorney's Office, to strengthen ethics enforcement in Texas.

The Public Integrity Unit, as part of the Travis County District Attorney's Office, handles complaints and prosecutions involving state officials and employees. In addition, the Legislature has delegated statewide jurisdiction to that office to prosecute insurance fraud and motor fuel tax cases.

Murr's legislation would separate the Texas Public Integrity Unit from the Travis County District Attorney, with oversight of the unit by a committee composed of the presiding judges of each of Texas' nine administrative judicial regions. Each region's presiding judge -- typically a district judge or senior district judge -- is appointed by the Governor for a four year term. The committee would supervise and oversee the unit and its director, a qualified state prosecutor, ensuring that appropriate policies are in place to maintain strong ethics and confidence in that office.

Murr stated, "We expect our judicial branch of government to be sensible and avoid putting politics into play. Oversight of the unit by a committee composed of judges from around the state provides a competent and pragmatic approach in supervising a necessary infrastructure to maintain important ethics laws and transparency in our state government."

In 2013, Governor Perry questioned the confidence he had in the Travis County District Attorney following her arrest and conviction for DWI. He subsequently vetoed state funding for the unit. Since then, the unit has remained partially funded using Travis County taxpayer dollars. The Texas House of Representatives' base budget includes funding for the Public Integrity Unit, contingent upon its relocation away from the DA's office.

Representative Murr, after meeting with representatives of the Governor's office, Speaker's office and the Office of Court Administration, filed HB 2222. Governor Abbott, in his State of the State address, proclaimed ethics legislation as one of five emergency items that he asked the Legislature to give expedited attention.

Murr explained, "The public has an expectation that Texas have ethics laws in place to ensure that we operate state government in a transparent manner and hold those who do not follow our laws accountable for their conduct. At the same time, we do not want a system where politics and personalities inject distrust and skepticism into any prosecution. With all the media attention surrounding the current status of the Public Integrity Unit, I want to make sure there is a viable and thought-out plan in place to restore integrity in this process."

There are 2 possible bathtubs that households and establishments can use. Bathtubs […]TestimonialsI called MHM Remodeling because my master bathroom needed a facelift. The shower was too cramped and there was not enough cabinet space. MHM Remodeling really opened up my bathroom. They were able to make the square footage seem a lot bigger. The guys were very nice and easy to communicate with about my ideas for the remodel. They were clean and respectful of my home. My new shower is great!Jenny GoddardOur Master Bathroom is a wonderful sanctuary, but our huge walk-in shower was an eyesore. After some setbacks due to our shower being out of square, Mike transformed it from a builder-grade white box to a masterpiece which we’re proud to show off! He does beautiful work and is very conscientious. Thanks Mike!Pam B. Cedar Park, TXThey came out and replace my back door/install a dog door as well as refinish my front door. They were very flexible on schedule, worked with me to choose/obtain materials, they were pleasant and professional, and the work was great. My new door/casing looks as if they have always been there. I will definitely use this company again.Jennifer Austin, TXOur bathroom is awesome and we absolutely love it! Mike’s quality of workmanship and attention to detail are unmatched. MHM truly cares about your project and will do everything possible to ensure that your expectations are not just met, but exceeded. Mike was a big help in planning our project and ensuring there were no surprises for us. He kept in constant communication on all issues, big and small, and made sure we came in under budget. We could not be happier with our bathroom and definitely recommend Mike and team! Dale Young Round Rock, TXI now have a luxurious custom bathroom in my home thanks to MHM Remodeling/Mike Stathos! My project was completed on time, even though we added painting a very large adjoining bedroom/ceiling to the project. Mike was in constant communication with me during the 4-week project and worked through issues that stemmed from original construction. He went above and beyond to ensure that the finished project was perfect. His attention to detail and very high quality work shows in every aspect of the finished bathroom. David Smith’s tiling skills make the bath, shower and floor a work of art. Definitely Tile King! The greatest compliment and testimony one can give a vendor is to refer them to friends – and I have done that twice! Thank you, Barb Hoelzer Austin, TXMike masterfully turned what once was a forgotten, unfinished bathroom into a sparkling little gem of a room. His skill and experience took my vision and turn it into a reality. He had to work within a tight time frame, with a tight budget, and in a very tight space and faced challenge after challenge head on. Mike’s attention to detail during every phase of the project, from conception to cleanup, is unparalleled. The result of his craftsmanship is a crisp, sparkly, happy little bathroom that pictures can not capture. D. CarrCongratulations on the excellent job in remodeling our master bathroom. The care, vision, and craftsmanship you displayed in completing the substantial, and sometimes intricate, overhaul of the area was masterful. We also appreciated your honesty, integrity, and sensitivity to our pocketbook. In particular, the fact that you were personally on the job and willing to take time to explain options was a real plus. Also, you did what you said you would do when you said you would do it, and that made our life significantly less hectic during the project. Since this was a complete remodel and it would take several pages to describe, just let us say that we would bring you back for work in a second and recommend you without hesitation. Jonnie and Tom Anderson Austin, TXM.H.M Remodeling did a great job with our master bath remodel. Mike helped us make design decisions early on in the project which significantly improved the final result. He was flexible and accommodating as we moved through the various stages of the project, and would take the time to review the progress with us at the end of each day. Mike gave us advice on how to save money on materials, and recommended vendors where we could get the best prices. The fact that he didn’t dictate suppliers or mark up materials made us very comfortable. We came in under our budget and right on time. He was very reliable and punctual, and I would recommend him to others looking to remodel their homes. Brian Betts Austin, TXMike remodeled a bathroom for us last year: we literally took the room down to the studs and replaced everything. When he bid the job, Mike told me that he knew exactly waht we wanted – as it turned out, he knew even better than we did. He made several suggestions that really made a difference in the look of the room. His attention to detail and superior workmanship really shows in the finished room. Also, he finished exactly when he said he would, and for the price we agreed upon. I have used his services since the remodel for another job, and would highly recommend the company to anyone. Mike is truly a very talented professional and working with him was a very pleasant and rewarding experience. Randy R Austin, TXMHM Remodeling had remodeled our bathrooms to perfection. So we knew that when we wanted our kitchen remodeled, the only person to call was Mike @MHM. Since we knew first hand of the expert craftsmanship and attention to detail Mike demands of his work, it was a no brainer, and sure enough we were not disappointed. Mike and his helper Nick did an amazing job on our kitchen remodel. He listened to what we wanted and had some great input of his own that was welcomed due to his many years of experience and vast knowledge of all facets of remodeling. I think we worked well as a team, which any remodel should be. We also had to leave several times for different reasons and could completely trust Mike and Nick to put everything away and lock the house up. If there is a better remodeler in Austin or Texas for that matter, you would be hard pressed to find one better than Mike at MHM Remodeling. Diron and Delissa KeelingOMG we love our bathroom! It came out so much better than we dreamed it would. Mike did such a great job from beginning to end! He was there for us all the way through. His wealth of experience and expertise was invaluable as we shopped for our granite, tile, fixtures and tub. Being the perfectionist he is fit right in with my husband’s personality. Everything Mike did was perfect and the contractors he uses know they have to be perfect as well. When things didn’t go quite as planned, as some parts of a remodel always do, he calmed us down and worked it all out. We felt so comfortable with Mike and his wonderful assistant that we even went on a trip right in the middle of everything. It was fun to come back and see all the work that had been accomplished. And one of the best things about using Mike is that he’ll be there for us if we need anything in the future. Whether it’s for something to do with the bathroom or a new project, he’ll be there to help us out.Thanks Mike!! Lisa and Steve SimmonsWe love our bathroom! Mike did an excellent job from start to finish. He kept in contact with us in the weeks before the job started to assist in our fixture / tile / granite choices and maintained the same level of contact throughout the entire job. He took great care of our home and the job site was neat and clean everyday when we got home from work. The finished product far exceeded our expectations – our bathroom looks like it belongs in a magazine. We would not hesitate to use MHM Remodeling for any other remodel job we needed done. The Ackerman'sMike did a fantastic job remodeling our bathroom! He’s highly skilled, performed the majority of the work himself, and produced a bathroom our family is very happy with. Mike’s obsessed about quality and has an eye for design – both of which show in his work. He was on-site working and supervising every day, and remodeled our bathroom in only five weeks; much faster than the multi-month estimates we received from other remodelers. Mike has established relationships with various suppliers, and was able to refer us to a number of good places to pick out affordable, quality allowances (e.g., tiles, cabinets, countertops, fixtures, shower glass, etc.). Finally, Mike warranties his work for three years. I don’t think we’ll need it, but this beats other remodelers we’ve worked with in the past, and it’s nice to have. R. Murr Austin, TXOur experience with Mike Stathos and MHM Remodeling was excellent. Mike was very thorough in his estimate and in explaining all of the work that would be done. He was very proactive in communicating any changes or issues that came up, and offered ideas and solutions for how to address them. Mike was very conscientious about his schedule and in keeping the work area (and our home) as neat and clean as possible. MHM Remodeling did a great job in bringing our design vision to reality, and we are very satisfied with the outcome of the project. C. Phillips Austin, TXMike remodeled our master bath in 2013 and we were very pleased with his work. I know he doesn’t typically work on fireplaces, but he was one of the first people I called. Fortunately, he was able to work on our fireplace in between his other projects. We had a general idea of how we wanted the fireplace to look & sent Mike a picture. We used the picture as a starting point and worked with Mike until we came up with a final design. As with our bathroom remodel, Mikes experience and advice was invaluable in helping us with color, design and material choices. The fireplace turned out great!My wife & I are very pleased with our fireplace remodel and highly recommend Mike for your next remodeling project. D. Batiste Austin, TXFrom the moment I met with Mike for a bid on our bathroom remodel, I was impressed. His knowledge, attention to detail, thoroughness, and professionalism definitely caught my attention. He explained all of the work that was needed in great detail so I had a clear picture of all they would do.After multiple bids I decided, without hesitation, to go with MHM Remodeling! Mike far exceeded my expectations. The whole remodel experience was painless; Mike’s focus was totally on our job, he kept me informed of everything during the process to ensure I was completely satisfied with the work, was always patient and willing to help me with construction, tile and fixture choices, kept the workspace clean, and best of all finished on time and on budget!I would highly recommend MHM Remodeling! Mike’s skill, craftsmanship, and amazing customer service will not disappoint. Linda WigginsThe time had come to finally bite the bullet and have the master bath remodeled. It had been delayed way too long. It’s a difficult task when trying to select the right contractor to do the work. Forest Gump summed it up when he said, “Life is like a box of chocolates; ya never know what you’re gonna get.” How true, but I believe we chose the right guy to tackle our project. Mike & Nick did an awesome job and the results speak for themselves. We are very pleased with the outcome and all the material selections came together to transform the space that seems lighter and more open. Mike and Nick are very meticulous about the quality of their work. It not only has to function properly, but also be pleasing to the eye. We will enjoy our new and massively improved bathroom for many years. J & M
