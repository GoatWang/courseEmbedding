Finally an opportunistic model that could result in some real growth.  Payments as the Core of a Meteoric Rise Airbnb has built its reputation as a new kind of hospitality business in the sharing economy, but maybe it should get recognition for payments innovation as well. The company has changed the way many consumers book their travel accommodations, but it’s actually built its infrastructure around payments. Unlike many other platforms, the company decided to process its own payments in-house shortly after opening for business. In a recent interview, Kapil Mokhat, the company’s director of payments and partnerships, told PYMNTS that having a customized payments processing engine has helped the company’s rapid expansion.“From 2008 to now, the growth at Airbnb has been incredible, and it hasn’t been a market-by-market approach — it’s really grown and spread in every direction. With that challenge in front of us, we needed to be able to rethink how to approach payments in a way that worked for us,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we haven’t partnered with others to make it work, but having that control has been key.”MoreReply60JJoeSpindle Bolsters Catalyst Commerce Solutions Platform Functionality June 15, 2017 Fully Integrated Marketing and Ecommerce Platform Affords Small Business Merchants Ability to Drive Transactions SCOTTSDALE, AZ -- (Marketwired) -- 06/15/17 -- Spindle, Inc. (OTCQB: SPDL) ("Spindle" or the "Company"), dba CATALYST Commerce Solutions, an emerging provider of integrated marketing and commerce solutions, today announced the launch of the CATALYST Marketing System. (www.CATALYSTMarketingSystem.com). The platform has been further enhanced through integrating the Company's customized CATALYST software with solution providers, the CATALYST Gateway, and its recently acquired software from CoverCake. The CATALYST Marketing System (CMS) enables small to medium sized businesses (SMBs) an ability to manage their business from one central hub. A fully integrated marketing and ecommerce platform, it affords merchants the ability to drive more transactions @ The Point of Interest™ through social media, customizable responsive websites, and Spindle's soon to be released consumer facing marketplace. The CATALYST Gateway encompasses the payments system and structure to manage various integrated marketing solutions. SMBs will now have the power to tap into Big Data in order to maximize monetization of their products, while also leveraging service offerings in unique and increasingly profitable ways with CATALYST. Merchants will further have the ability through utilization of the CATALYST Marketing System to mine social media data and create curated content posts in order to drive consumer attention from their initial impression and through our unique purchasing process. The CATALYST packages are affordably priced in order to maximize return on investment by providing SMBs an accessible platform which maximizes user engagement scenarios foundational to drive more business. With packages ranging from $200-$1000 per month and an array of capabilities, the CMS rivals higher priced marketing solutions that are less robust. Spindle EVP & CATALYST, GM Antone Biondo, stated, "We believe the CATALYST Marketing System is emblematic of the high quality solutions that our company will become known for delivering. The CATALYST Marketing System will be marketed directly to merchants through our direct sales efforts, in addition to a number of sales organizations expected to license our platform. Recent proprietary enhancements, along with strategic partner integrations, have enabled us to create a truly sophisticated and mutually beneficial merchant facing solution set for the SMB market. CMS is the result of a collaborative effort between our CATALYST programming and operations team leveraging our strong industry expertise in payments with marketing industry experts such as advisory board member Brian Sathianathan. We have honed our approach to benefit SMBs in specific verticals that are looking to increase their profitability while driving down the hard and soft costs that affect the management of their day to day business. CMS is a truly enterprise level solution that has the ability to improve merchants' day to day operations, while delivering a consistent return on investment." The Company has already commenced working with various merchants in order to board new business on the CATALYST Marketing System. Together, the Company's CATALYST Gateway, CATALYST Marketing System, CATALYST Team Sports and soon to be released CATALYST CRM and marketplace, are core components of an expanding proprietary solution set to deliver a unique ecosystem to the market.MoreReplyReplies (1)40JJohnLooks like Spindle let the Clarks off the hook. They've settled the case against them.ReplyReplies (2)04JJoeSpindle Executes Strategic Agreements with Concourse Team ExpressCATALYST Team Sports Selects Concourse Team Express as Official Sporting Goods Dealer While Concourse Team Express Licenses CATALYST Team Sports PlatformMESA, AZ--(Marketwired - May 30, 2017) - Spindle, Inc. (OTCQB: SPDL) ("Spindle" or the "Company"), an emerging provider of commerce solutions, today announced that the Company has executed two strategic agreements with Concourse Team Express ("Team Express").As a leading multi-channel internet retailer since 1990, Team Express markets sporting goods, athletic equipment, footwear and apparel via print and digital catalogs, targeted websites and a retail store in San Antonio, TX. Team Express covers all the bases in offering the best selection of brand names players recognize. Its proprietary websites include www.BaseballExpress.com, www.Softball.com, www.teamexpress.com www.BasketballExpress.com, www.FootballAmerica.com.Through this strategic relationship, Team Express will utilize the CATALYST Team Sports Platform (CatalystTeamSports.com) to offer teams the ability to manage their rosters, collect fees, integrate social media, team scheduling, statistics, location directions and more. CATALYST Team Sports will be adding the Team Express custom teamwear and team store solutions to the platform to enable teams unique fundraising opportunities while providing teams, players and fans a year-round source for the latest, top-of-the-line equipment, apparel, and footwear from the most recognized sporting goods brands at very reasonable prices.Kevin Udell, Concourse Team Express Vice President and sporting goods industry veteran of over 17 years, stated, "Together, CATALYST Team Sports and Team Express is a winning combination! We expect our partnership will create the ultimate sports marketplace for athletes, coaches, teams, and leagues seeking the latest online sports organization tools with social network integration and access to the latest, most advanced sporting goods."EVP of Spindle & CATALYST GM, Antone Biondo, stated, "We are very pleased to enter into this relationship that we believe will be mutually beneficial and create measurable value for all involved. Having personally been a customer of Team Express' Baseball Express for more than twenty years, I am deeply familiar with the value they bring to their customers. With decades of hands-on experience in fulfillment, and more importantly, in working with coaches across the country, delivering quality brand products at affordable prices, we understand the invaluable know-how Team Express brings to the table. Together, I believe the partnership further enhances both of our respective businesses creating a truly scalable win-win opportunity."Biondo concluded, "We expect this relationship to complement our recently acquired software from CoverCake as we move to expand our sporting goods marketing through our marketing automation capabilities and social media tools. CATALYST Team Sports, coupled with these marketing tools and Team Express products, are expected to afford us the ability to monetize our consumer engagement at a higher level, while creating a new ecommerce revenue vertical that allows us to capture revenue on not only processing, but also on sales of hard goods that typically carry higher margins."MoreReply20JJoeMAY 26, 2017 @ 10:25 AM 4,421 The Little Black Book of Billionaire SecretsSports Tech Company Acquired After Raising $24 MillionDarren Heitner ,   CONTRIBUTORI cover the intersection of sports and money.  Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.Krossover founder Vasu Kulkarni says his company's exit is a pretty good sign for the sports tech world. (Photo by Grant Lamos IV/Getty Images for AWXII)Sports video analysis and statistics company Krossover has been acquired by Dallas-based Blue Star Sports, a company linked to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and focused on building sports management software. The acquisition comes after Krossover, an eight year old company, has raised over $24 million through a variety of rounds of funding.Krossover founder Vasu Kulkarni thinks that the deal is especially notable because there are very few true sports technology exits."It's one of the reasons why, in general, venture capitalists are a little worried about investing in the space," explains Kulkarni. "Not that this is an Instagram exit, but it is special for a company in New York that raised decent money to have a decent exit and be one of the true sports tech companies to exit outside of a media entity like Bleacher Report. It's a pretty good sign for the sports tech world and generally a good sign considering how much money has been spent in this space in the past few years."Kulkarni remembers that when he first went out to raise money he could not get a dime, especially from U.S.-based investors. Now, he laughs about the fact that he could not get anyone in America to take sports analytics seriously. That was 2009.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads"There were never institutional guys willing to get behind us," recalls Kulkarni. "It was always team owners or people related to game of basketball or football who understood it."But those individuals who understood Kulkarni's concept to provide a web-based video indexing platform are pretty prominent in the world of sports. They include Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, former NBA player David Robinson and Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, all of whom in Krossover's Series B round of funding.And then came Blue Star Sports at a very important time."If Blue Star hadn't come around eighteen months ago, with Rob [Wechsler] who is a rock star and has sold multiple companies in the past, I don't think a big private equity group would back someone with $100 million from day one to go on an acquisition spree," says Kulkarni. "Who else has enough capital to make this type of purchase in this space?"Recommended by ForbesMOST POPULAR Photos: The Richest Person In Every State+40,093 VIEWS Samsung Leak Reveals Massive Galaxy Note 8SAPVoice: Going Digital? Five Things To ConsiderBlue Star Sports was a fit for Krossover when Kulkarni did not see many others around."I think that people don't think you can get a return here," says Kulkarni about the sports tech space. "They're not entirely wrong. It is certainly a difficult space to make money."Fortunately for Kulkarni and his team, who will be sticking around at Krossover, they never had to worry about replacing Blue Star Sports, which reached out to Kulkarni roughly eighteen months ago, right when Blue Star Sports was getting started."They're a private equity group and we were kind of like, 'we're not a private equity back-able company at this point, or one that people will buy . . . we are still in startup mode and still not profitable,'" explains Kulkarni. "But they came back to us earlier this year after they raised more money from Genstar [Capital] and said they think we would really be able to help drive revenue for all these other businesses, because video is driving so much revenue in sports."In exchange for the sale, Kulkarni and his team will receive a mix of cash and stock. He says that the amount of overlap between Krossover and Blue Star Sports' companies is "crazy" and if everything goes according to plan, then it will be a very good exit for investors and founders, but that there exist a lot of variable components."If things don't go as well, then it will be an okay exit and we will all make out alright," adds Kulkarni.Darren Heitner the Founder of South Florida-based HEITNER LEGAL, P.L.L.C. and Sports Agent Blog.

One word summary: grim.ReplyReplies (4)31oopportunist_2Always buy earnings. This is a game about earnings.Where is the earnings?Reply00MMikeSPDL filed the NT -10Q form for  the Q1 report today, meaning up to a five calendar day delay in reporting, so maybe something by Friday or before.ReplyReplies (5)02MMikeIt's been relatively quiet of late with low trading volumes again.  Might be that folks are waiting on Q1 report that is due out by Monday May 15th, as well as the promised shareholder update mentioned in the Sathianathan news report.  I would expect that with all the effort put forth to get the 2016 annual report out, that the stage would be set to have a timely Q1 2017 filing, but no guarantees with SPDL.  Shareholder letter likely will come out with the Q1 report or a day or so later as has been their practice in the past.  I would not expect much in the way of revenue in Q!, as with only 5 Full time employees, not much infrastructure to run a business engine without a lot of 3rd party support staff.  We will see.  In my view, SPDL has built a payments transactional engine / platform, with some valuable bolt-ons that has advantages, and may simply be looking for a buyout by a large player anxious to get into this market space.MoreReplyReplies (2)20JJoeInteresting open market opportunity for Spindle. Market is still wide open and recent announcements seem targeted right at it. Keep your fingers crossed…once bitten twice shy, but I have way more faith in confidence in Scott than I ever did his predecessor. Findings from the consumer survey showed:§  Top merchants are struggling with personalization. Nearly half of respondents said it’s important for retailers to consider their browsing history and online purchases when customizing marketing for them.§  More interactive search methods top consumers’ wish lists. One in five consumers are interested in using voice or photo search, but not a single top 100 retailer extended either option to shoppers through primary eCommerce sites.§  Limited site search capabilities are degrading the customer experience. The vast majority of retailers relied heavily on basic keyword terms to itemize search results and didn’t accurately guess what a shopper might be looking for based on browsing history. One-third of retailers’ search bars utilized visuals with product thumbnails in suggested results as shoppers typed a query.MoreReply60MMishagoogle the guy quoted in yesterday from covercake pr. brian sathianathan big name in bay area vc community. not a bad guy to have in company corner or ours as shareholder.

Business Description

Spindle, Inc. (Spindle), incorporated in 2011, is a commerce-centric company with four primary customers: individuals, consumers (buyers), merchants (sellers, retail, brands, and destinations) and institutions. The Company generates revenue through patented conversion and networked payment processes under the Spindle product line and licensing of its Intellectual Property. The Company's products allow the secure movement of funds between parties as well as provide brands, merchants, and institutions with the conversion tools necessary to deliver a seamless frictionless finance ecosystem. 

For individual users, the Spindle product is intended to be a networked service that allows users to perform commerce as well as send and receive funds with the confidence that the system is simple and secure. The Spindle payment platform allows users to register and attain an account that is accessible via the internet or mobile device to facilitate commerce and manage the exchange of funds between other participating users.

The Spindle ecosystem consists of not only individuals moving funds, but also professional and business entities who seek more ways to interact with consumers and, chosen singly or in concert with one another, facilitate commerce. For its enterprise clients, Spindle provides P2P, P2B, B2B, B2P, and Mobile Check Deposit. With Spindle's fleet of conversion and payment solutions participants are afforded a simpler, more elegant, and secure way to handle business that won't become obsolete with ever changing terrestrial, online, or mobile environments. 

The Spindle, Inc. suite of products, chosen singly or in concert with one another, offer a better way to extend the life of terrestrial, internet, mobile, and other networked marketing and advertising campaigns. Spindle, Inc. products are device and hardware agnostic, focusing instead on enterprise, banking, and brand-centric solutions that streamline the transactional process in a highly secure space. That's a basic tenet behind our frictionless finance concept pioneered by Spindle and an idea made whole through our commitment to providing easy-to-use yet enterprise class solutions for any size company where conversion and transaction is lifeblood.
