Radiator Labs, Inc. |   About Us






























































 









































 






ABOUT

 


Radiator Labs was born in a New York winter. Founders Dr. Marshall Cox and Professor John Kymissis developed their concept while Marshall was living in overheated graduate student housing. Through conversations with Professor Kymissis, the founders came up with the idea of the Cozy™, an insulated smart radiator cover that brings relief from overheating. After a year of initial testing in Marshall’s apartment, Marshall competed in – and won – the Grand Prize at – the MIT Clean Energy Prize. With $220,000 in prize money Radiator Labs was born!

 




Our Mission
The Radiator Labs mission is to eliminate overheating in steam heated buildings. By incorporating radiator-level control with real-time data visualization we can eliminate billions in wasted fuel, all while providing comfort and control to residents for the first time in a building’s history.

Radiator Labs, Inc. |   About Us






























































 









































 






ABOUT

 


Radiator Labs was born in a New York winter. Founders Dr. Marshall Cox and Professor John Kymissis developed their concept while Marshall was living in overheated graduate student housing. Through conversations with Professor Kymissis, the founders came up with the idea of the Cozy™, an insulated smart radiator cover that brings relief from overheating. After a year of initial testing in Marshall’s apartment, Marshall competed in – and won – the Grand Prize at – the MIT Clean Energy Prize. With $220,000 in prize money Radiator Labs was born!

 




Our Mission
The Radiator Labs mission is to eliminate overheating in steam heated buildings. By incorporating radiator-level control with real-time data visualization we can eliminate billions in wasted fuel, all while providing comfort and control to residents for the first time in a building’s history.

THE PROBLEM

 


The US Department of Energy estimates that 30% of steam heat is wasted, translating into over $7 billion in annual waste in the US alone.
 
The money is literally pouring out of our windows.
 
Buildings run boilers to cater to the coldest room in a building in order to meet statutory heating requirements, drastically overheating the remaining majority of rooms. As a result, residents and tenants are miserably overheated.

 











 




THE SOLUTION

 


A user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing radiator cover that allows you to control temperature in each room while saving money and energy.
 
Our system redistributes steam flow by retrofitting entire buildings, increasing efficiency and saving up to 35% in heating costs.
 
The Cozy™  is easy to install and requires no contact with plumbing or steam. Want to reduce your assets operating expenses and provide enhanced tenant comfort? Now you can.

General

Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Trial by Jury. Please read this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It is part of your contract with Radiator Labs and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Radiator Labs that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Radiator Labs, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, assigns, suppliers and licensors as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Radiator Labs should be sent to: 15 Metrotech Center NYC ACRE 19th Floor Brooklyn NY 11201. After the Notice is received, you and Radiator Labs may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Radiator Labs do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S. the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that Radiator Labs made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, Radiator Labs will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
Time Limits. If you or Radiator Labs pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Radiator Labs, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Radiator Labs.
Waiver of July Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Radiator Labs in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND RADIATOR LABS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Radiator Labs.
Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Radiator Labs may bring an individual action in small claims court.
Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Hennepin County, Minnesota, for such purpose.


Governing Law. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of New York, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

How it Works

 











The Cozy is an insulating enclosure that is installed over existing radiators.

 


When the system senses that a room needs heat, a small fan turns on to circulate warm air throughout the room.

 



When the room is satisfied, the fan turns off to prevent overheating and keep the room comfortable.

 



Result: Comfort, cost savings and reduced emissions.

  





Temperature Control

 


Control can be kept to management or granted to tenants via phone or computer.
 
The Cozy fan turns on when it senses that the room temperature is below the desired set-point. When the set-point is satisfied, the fan turns off, which traps heat. This results in a room that maintains temperature, with minimal variability.
 
Use our app to adjust the set-point and release trapped hot air into the room as you need it.

 


Real buildings, Real results

Meet the award-winning Cozy™

 


The Cozy consists of an insulating enclosure, which traps heat, and a temperature controlled fan, which provides heat when activated. The system’s sensors provide detailed information on radiator performance and steam system health via a dashboard.
 
The Cozy is essentially a smart thermostat for your radiator. It allows a building to save enormous amounts of energy while finally providing temperature control to management and/or tenants. Place the Cozy over a radiator, plug it in, and set the perfect apartment temperature: no more heating complaints or open windows in the winter!

Real Time, 24/7 monitoring.

 


Each Cozy includes sensors that monitor radiator and room temperatures. Sensors relay data through the Cloud providing 24/7 real-time alerts on building envelope issues, radiator health, steam traps and boiler function.
 
Analyzing radiator temperatures can pinpoint malfunctions (like escaping heat) and direct corrective maintenance. Room temperature data enables a wide variety of analytics including the identification of building envelope leaks.
 
For 2 pipe systems, the Cozy measures the performance and functionality of steam traps. With this data we can pinpoint non-functioning traps, altering the economics of trap maintenance and minimize wasted steam.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
