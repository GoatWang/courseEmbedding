Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the U.S. Bond Enhanced Index Fund among 
856,
856,
757
and 
539
Intermediate-Term Bond
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

				Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. 
Share price, principal value, yield and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.   
			


				The U.S. Bond Enhanced Index Fund charges a 0.5% 
redemption fee on shares held 90 days or less. 
The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of the redemption fee; 
if it did, the performance would be lower.
			


2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

3
					
					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns.

As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 856 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to provide a total return that matches or incrementally exceeds the performance of the U.S. investment-grade bond market.




Strategy



The fund's overall investment strategy is to match or incrementally exceed the performance of the U.S. investment-grade bond market. Under normal conditions, it will invest at least 80% of its net assets (including any borrowings for investment purposes) in bonds that are held in its benchmark index. The fund's holdings will normally include U.S. government and agency obligations, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, and U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers.


Risk



In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is an unmanaged market value-weighted index for U.S. dollar denominated investment-grade fixed-rate debt issues, including government, corporate, asset-backed, and mortgage-backed securities with maturities of at least one year.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. Fixed Income StyleMap� StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
3. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
4. Fixed Income StyleMap� StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

	Managers Letter






	Fellow Shareholders





	Most sectors of the U.S. bond market
	generated solidly positive returns for the six-month period. In December, the
	Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time since 2006, raising
	the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. After that change, the Fed held
	interest rates steady through the end of the six-month period, citing turbulent
	global financial markets. The U.S. employment market stayed healthy, but
	first-quarter 2016 economic growth was disappointing. The U.S. Treasury yield
	curve continued to flatten over the course of the reporting period as short-term
	yields increased while longer-maturity yields decreased.






	Your fund returned 2.73% for the six
	months through April 30, 2016, slightly underperforming the Barclays U.S.
	Aggregate Bond Index, as shown in the Performance


	Comparison table. Security selection in the investment-grade corporate
	bond allocation accounted for the underperformance. The funds net asset value
	(NAV) increased to $11.17 from $11.04 over the past six months, while dividends
	totaled $0.16.





	ECONOMY AND INTEREST
	RATES





	In December, the Federal Reserve increased
	interest rates for the first time since 2006, raising the federal funds rate by
	25 basis points. The U.S. employment market stayed healthy through the reporting
	period as the unemployment rate reached an eight-year low of 4.9% in January and
	February before ticking up slightly in March as more people reentered the labor
	force to search for jobs. However,


	first-quarter
	2016 U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth was disappointing, with the latest
	available estimate showing that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of
	only 0.5% as consumers remained reluctant to spend. Inflation stayed stubbornly
	low, although oil prices rallied sharply to over $45 per barrel at the end of
	the


	reporting period after falling below $27 in
	January. After its initial rate hike in December, the Fed held interest rates
	steady through the end of April, citing turbulent global financial
	markets.






	The U.S. Treasury yield curve continued to
	flatten over the course of the reporting period as short-term yields increased
	while longer-maturity yields decreased. Fed rate


	hikes affect the prices of short-maturity debt more than longer-term
	bonds. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.) The yield on the
	six-month Treasury bill climbed to 0.40% at the end of April from 0.23% at the
	beginning of the reporting period. On the other hand, the 30-year Treasury
	bonds yield decreased to 2.66% from 2.93% at the start of November 2015. Yields
	on many other high-quality developed markets sovereign debt, including some
	German and Japanese government bonds, decreased into negative territory,
	boosting demand for relatively high-yielding U.S. Treasuries.





	BOND MARKET NEWS





	Most sectors of the U.S. bond market
	generated solidly positive returns for the six-month period. Long-term
	Treasuries benefited most from the rally and produced attractive returns.
	Corporate bonds also performed well over the course of the reporting period
	despite selling pressure at the beginning of 2016, with investment-grade
	corporates outperforming high yield bonds. Bonds from energy-related issuers
	account for a large percentage of the noninvestment-grade bond market and lost more ground in the early-year
	rout; the rebound in oil prices and in investor sentiment toward asset classes
	with more credit risk helped support the corporate bond market near the end of
	the reporting period. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities produced more modest
	returns.










	PORTFOLIO REVIEW





	The fund is designed for investors who
	want to benefit from broad exposure to investment-grade bonds. Its objective is
	to closely track the performance of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index after
	fees, but we attempt to compensate for fund expenses by seeking modest
	additional returns through small variations in sector weightings. To a lesser
	extent, typically, we also employ what is referred to as


	curve positioning or duration managementadjustments in the mix of
	maturities of our holdings based on our view on the direction of interest rates.






	Overweight exposure to bonds from several
	commodity-related issuers within the portfolios allocation to investment-grade
	corporate bonds weighed on relative performance and accounted for the funds


	underperformance. Despite the rebound in
	commodities prices in the latter part of the reporting period, general price
	volatility in corporate bonds in energy-related sectors dragged down their
	returns. However, on the positive side, security selection within our allocation
	to Build America Bonds, which are taxable municipal debt, contributed to
	relative returns.




	 





	The portfolios duration was slightly
	longer than the duration of the benchmark, which benefited relative performance
	as intermediate- and long-term Treasury yields decreased. We favor this
	long-duration positioning to add incremental yield as well as to hedge some of
	the portfolios credit risk. The fund is underweight shorter maturities and
	overweight intermediate- and longer-term bonds because we anticipate that the
	yield curve will continue to flatten as Fed rate increases push short-maturity
	yields higher.




	The portfolio remained overweight
	investment-grade corporate bonds, where credit spreads are attractive relative
	to other sectors with credit risk. We are also overweight asset-backed
	securities, which offer strong ties to increasing consumer spending in the
	improving U.S. economy. We continue to favor commercial
	mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as real estate fundamentals improve. Credit
	spreads on CMBS have reached their widest levels in over two years.




	The prospect of rising interest rates has
	triggered concerns that some investors could change course and redeploy their
	assets into other areas of the market, pressuring fixed income sectors with
	limited liquidity. Net outflows during periods of rising rates are not new;


	indeed, such was the case in 1994 and 2000 when
	rates turned up. The market was smaller than it is today, however, thanks to
	recent inflows.






	Because of this evolving environment, T.
	Rowe Price is taking steps to ensure that our funds function smoothly during
	transitional periods as the Fed makes policy changes that are likely to affect
	the direction of interest rates. These steps


	include assessing the liquidity of our portfolios, conducting stress
	tests that take various market scenarios into consideration, evaluating risk
	management strategies to determine appropriate actions, and taking other
	measures to ensure the continued smooth operation of our portfolios. In our
	view, we do not believe that your fund will be adversely affected by the
	conditions we have just mentioned, but we want to inform our shareholders that
	we are aware of the changing market environment and are monitoring it
	closely.





	OUTLOOK





	Although U.S. economic growth was
	disappointingly slow in the first quarter of 2016, we anticipate that consumer
	spending will pick up and help drive GDP growth for the full year to about 2%.
	The ongoing improvement in the housing market and increasing government spending
	should also help support economic growth, more than offsetting a contraction in
	exports. Inflation should finally begin to rise from its low levels of 2015 and
	early 2016, and we are starting to see signs of upward pressure on wages as the
	labor market steadily generates more jobs.




	We continue to think that the pace of Fed
	rate hikes will be measured and gradual relative to historical cycles of
	monetary policy tightening. With the Fed likely to act cautiously, the
	transition to higher rates


	may not be as painful
	as some fear. Short-term yields are likely to feel the most upward pressure as
	the market prices in the timing and pace of monetary tightening. At the
	long-term end of the yield curve, the presence of large institutional buyers and
	the attractive valuations of U.S. Treasuries relative to other developed markets
	sovereign debt could temper a rise in yields.




	In this volatile, changing fixed income
	environment, we will continue to prudently apply some active management
	techniques to try to generate incremental gains relative to the passive
	benchmark index. Our analysts continue to find select opportunities for
	risk-adjusted returns within their areas of focus. As always, in-depth research
	and careful risk management remain integral to our investment
	process.

	RISKS OF INVESTING IN FIXED INCOME
	SECURITIES





	Funds that invest in fixed income
	securities are subject to price declines due to rising interest rates, with
	long-term securities generally most sensitive to rate fluctuations. Other risks
	include credit rating downgrades and defaults on scheduled interest and
	principal payments. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk
	(particularly if falling rates lead to heavy refinancing activity) and extension
	risk, which is an increase in interest rates that causes a funds average
	maturity to lengthen unexpectedly due to a drop in mortgage prepayments. This
	would increase the funds sensitivity to rising interest rates and its potential
	for price declines.

	Performance and Expenses









	Growth of
	$10,000








	This chart shows the value of a
	hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 fiscal year periods
	or since inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared
	with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group
	average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted
	from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.




	 










	Fund Expense
	Example








	As a mutual fund shareholder, you may
	incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, such as redemption fees or
	sales loads, and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees, distribution and
	service (12b-1) fees, and other fund expenses. The following example is intended
	to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the fund
	and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual
	funds. The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning
	of the most recent six-month period and held for the entire period.





	Actual Expenses




	The first line of the following table (Actual) provides
	information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use the
	information on this line, together with your account balance, to estimate the
	expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by
	$1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then
	multiply the result by the number on the first line under the heading Expenses
	Paid During Period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during
	this period.





	Hypothetical Example for Comparison
	Purposes




	The information on the second
	line of the table (Hypothetical) is based on hypothetical account values and
	expenses derived from the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed 5% per year
	rate of return before expenses (not the funds actual return). You may compare
	the ongoing costs of investing in the fund with other funds by contrasting this
	5% hypothetical example and the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the
	shareholder reports of the other funds. The hypothetical account values and
	expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or
	expenses you paid for the period.





	Note:



	T. Rowe Price charges an account service fee that is not included in the
	accompanying table. The account service fee is charged on a quarterly basis,
	usually during the last week of a calendar quarter, and applies to accounts with
	balances below $10,000 on the day of the assessment. The fee is charged to
	accounts that fall below $10,000 for any reason, including market fluctuations,
	redemptions, or exchanges. When an account with less than $10,000 is closed
	either through redemption or exchange, the fee is charged and deducted from the
	proceeds. The fee applies to IRAs but not to retirement plans directly
	registered with T. Rowe Price Services or accounts maintained by intermediaries
	through NSCC

	®

	Networking. If you are subject to the fee, keep it in
	mind when you are estimating the ongoing expenses of investing in the fund and
	when comparing the expenses of this fund with other funds.




	You should also be aware that the expenses
	shown in the table highlight only your ongoing costs and do not reflect any
	transaction costs, such as redemption fees or sales loads. Therefore, the second
	line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help
	you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. To the extent
	a fund charges transaction costs, however, the total cost of owning that fund is
	higher.

	Notes to
	Financial Statements








	T. Rowe Price U.S. Bond Enhanced Index
	Fund, Inc. (the fund), is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940
	(the 1940 Act) as a diversified, open-end management investment company. The
	fund incepted on November 30, 2000. The fund seeks to provide a total return
	that matches or incrementally exceeds the performance of the U.S.
	investment-grade bond market, as represented by the Barclays Capital U.S.
	Aggregate Bond Index.








	NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES






	Basis of Preparation



	The fund is an investment company and follows accounting and
	reporting guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)



	Accounting Standards
	Codification



	Topic 946 (ASC 946). The
	accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), including,
	but not limited to, ASC 946. GAAP requires the use of estimates made by
	management. Management believes that estimates and valuations are appropriate;
	however, actual results may differ from those estimates, and the valuations
	reflected in the accompanying financial statements may differ from the value
	ultimately realized upon sale or maturity.





	Investment Transactions, Investment
	Income, and Distributions



	Income and expenses
	are recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are
	amortized for financial reporting purposes. Paydown gains and losses are
	recorded as an adjustment to interest income. Inflation adjustments to the
	principal amount of inflation-indexed bonds are reflected as interest income.
	Dividends received from mutual fund investments are reflected as dividend
	income; capital gain distributions, if any, are reflected as realized gain/loss.
	Dividend income and capital gain distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend
	date. Income tax-related interest and penalties, if incurred, would be recorded
	as income tax expense. Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade
	date. Realized gains and losses are reported on the identified cost basis.
	Income distributions are declared daily and paid monthly. Distributions to
	shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Capital gain distributions,
	if any, are generally declared and paid by the fund annually.





	Redemption Fees



	A 0.5% fee is assessed on redemptions of fund shares held for
	90 days or less to deter short-term trading and to protect the interests of
	long-term shareholders. Redemption fees are withheld from proceeds that
	shareholders receive from the sale or exchange of fund shares. The fees are paid
	to the fund and are recorded as an increase to paid-in capital. The fees may
	cause the redemption price per share to differ from the net asset value per
	share.





	New Accounting Guidance



	In May 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,



	Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820),
	Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value
	per Share (or Its Equivalent).



	The ASU
	removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all
	investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share
	practical expedient and amends certain disclosure requirements for such
	investments. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods
	beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption will have no effect on the funds
	net assets or results of operations.





	NOTE 2 - VALUATION





	The funds financial instruments are
	valued and its net asset value (NAV) per share is computed at the close of the
	New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), normally 4 p.m. ET, each day the NYSE is open
	for business.





	Fair Value



	The funds financial instruments are reported at fair value, which GAAP
	defines as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
	a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
	measurement date. The T. Rowe Price Valuation Committee (the Valuation
	Committee) has been established by the funds Board of Directors (the Board) to
	ensure that financial instruments are appropriately priced at fair value in
	accordance with GAAP and the 1940 Act. Subject to oversight by the Board, the
	Valuation Committee develops and oversees pricing-related policies and
	procedures and approves all fair value determinations. Specifically, the
	Valuation Committee establishes procedures to value securities; determines
	pricing techniques, sources, and persons eligible to effect fair value pricing
	actions; oversees the selection, services, and performance of pricing vendors;
	oversees valuation-related business continuity practices; and provides guidance
	on internal controls and valuation-related matters. The Valuation Committee
	reports to the Board and has representation from legal, portfolio management and
	trading, operations, risk management, and the funds treasurer.




	Various valuation techniques and inputs
	are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments. GAAP establishes
	the following fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs used to measure
	fair value:




	Level 1  quoted prices (unadjusted) in
	active markets for identical financial instruments that the fund can access at
	the reporting date




	Level 2  inputs other than Level 1 quoted
	prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly (including, but not
	limited to, quoted prices for similar financial instruments in active markets,
	quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in inactive
	markets, interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit
	spreads)




	Level 3  unobservable inputs




	Observable inputs are developed using
	market data, such as publicly available information about actual events or
	transactions, and reflect the assumptions that market participants would use to
	price the financial instrument. Unobservable inputs are those for which market
	data are not available and are developed using the best information available
	about the assumptions that market participants would use to price the financial
	instrument. GAAP requires valuation techniques to maximize the use of relevant
	observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When multiple
	inputs are used to derive fair value, the financial instrument is assigned to
	the level within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest-level input that
	is significant to the fair value of the financial instrument. Input levels are
	not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with financial
	instruments at that level but rather the degree of judgment used in determining
	those values.





	Valuation Techniques



	Debt securities generally are traded in the over-the-counter
	(OTC) market. Securities with remaining maturities of one year or more at the
	time of acquisition are valued at prices furnished by dealers who make markets
	in such securities or by an independent pricing service, which considers the
	yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity, and type, as
	well as prices quoted by dealers who make markets in such securities. Securities
	with remaining maturities of less than one year at the time of acquisition
	generally use amortized cost in local currency to approximate fair value.
	However, if amortized cost is deemed not to reflect fair value or the fund holds
	a significant amount of such securities with remaining maturities of more than
	60 days, the securities are valued at prices furnished by dealers who make
	markets in such securities or by an independent pricing service. Generally, debt
	securities are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; however, to
	the extent the valuations include significant unobservable inputs, the
	securities would be categorized in Level 3.




	Investments in mutual funds are valued at
	the mutual funds closing NAV per share on the day of valuation and are
	categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Assets and liabilities other
	than financial instruments, including short-term receivables and payables, are
	carried at cost, or estimated realizable value, if less, which approximates fair
	value.




	Thinly traded financial instruments and
	those for which the above valuation procedures are inappropriate or are deemed
	not to reflect fair value are stated at fair value as determined in good faith
	by the Valuation Committee. The objective of any fair value pricing
	determination is to arrive at a price that could reasonably be expected from a
	current sale. Financial instruments fair valued by the Valuation Committee are
	primarily private placements, restricted securities, warrants, rights, and other
	securities that are not publicly traded.




	Subject to oversight by the Board, the
	Valuation Committee regularly makes good faith judgments to establish and adjust
	the fair valuations of certain securities as events occur and circumstances
	warrant. For instance, in determining the fair value of troubled or thinly
	traded debt instruments, the Valuation Committee considers a variety of factors,
	which may include, but are not limited to, the issuers business prospects, its
	financial standing and performance, recent investment transactions in the
	issuer, strategic events affecting the company, market liquidity for the issuer,
	and general economic conditions and events. In consultation with the investment
	and pricing teams, the Valuation Committee will determine an appropriate
	valuation technique based on available information, which may include both
	observable and unobservable inputs. The Valuation Committee typically will
	afford greatest weight to actual prices in arms length transactions, to the
	extent they represent orderly transactions between market participants,
	transaction information can be reliably obtained, and prices are deemed
	representative of fair value. However, the Valuation Committee may also consider
	other valuation methods such as a discount or premium from market value of a
	similar, freely traded security of the same issuer; discounted cash flows; yield
	to maturity; or some combination. Fair value determinations are reviewed on a
	regular basis and updated as information becomes available, including actual
	purchase and sale transactions of the issue. Because any fair value
	determination involves a significant amount of judgment, there is a degree of
	subjectivity inherent in such pricing decisions, and fair value prices
	determined by the Valuation Committee could differ from those of other market
	participants. Depending on the relative significance of unobservable inputs,
	including the valuation technique(s) used, fair valued securities may be
	categorized in Level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy.





	Valuation Inputs



	The following table summarizes the funds financial
	instruments, based on the inputs used to determine their fair values on April
	30, 2016:







	There were no material transfers between
	Levels 1 and 2 during the six months ended April 30, 2016.





	NOTE 3 - OTHER INVESTMENT
	TRANSACTIONS





	Consistent with its investment objective,
	the fund engages in the following practices to manage exposure to certain risks
	and/or to enhance performance. The investment objective, policies, program, and
	risk factors of the fund are described more fully in the funds prospectus and
	Statement of Additional Information.





	Restricted Securities



	The fund may invest in securities that are subject to legal or
	contractual restrictions on resale. Prompt sale of such securities at an
	acceptable price may be difficult and may involve substantial delays and
	additional costs.





	TBA Purchase and Sale Commitments



	The fund may enter into to-be-announced (TBA)
	purchase or sale commitments, pursuant to which it agrees to purchase or sell,
	respectively, mortgage-backed securities for a fixed unit price, with payment
	and delivery at a scheduled future date beyond the customary settlement period
	for such securities. With TBA transactions, the particular securities to be
	delivered are not identified at the trade date; however, delivered securities
	must meet specified terms, including issuer, rate, and mortgage term, and be
	within industry-accepted good delivery standards. The fund may enter into TBA


	purchase transactions with the intention of
	taking possession of the underlying securities, may elect to extend the
	settlement by rolling the transaction, and/or may use TBAs to gain interim
	exposure to underlying securities. Until settlement, the fund maintains liquid
	assets sufficient to settle its TBA commitments.




	To mitigate counterparty risk, the fund
	has entered into agreements with TBA counterparties that provide for collateral
	and the right to offset amounts due to or from those counterparties under
	specified conditions. Subject to minimum transfer amounts, collateral
	requirements are determined and transfers made based on the net aggregate
	unrealized gain or loss on all TBA commitments with a particular counterparty.
	At any time, the funds risk of loss from a particular counterparty related to
	its TBA commitments is the aggregate unrealized gain on appreciated TBAs in
	excess of unrealized loss on depreciated TBAs and collateral received, if any,
	from such counterparty. As of April 30, 2016, no collateral was pledged by the
	fund or counterparties for TBAs.





	Dollar Rolls



	The fund may enter into dollar roll transactions, pursuant to
	which it sells a mortgage-backed TBA or security and simultaneously agrees to
	purchase a similar, but not identical, TBA with the same issuer, rate, and terms
	on a later date at a set price from the same counterparty. The fund may execute
	a roll to obtain better underlying mortgage securities or to enhance returns.
	The fund generally enters into dollar roll transactions with the intention of
	taking possession of the underlying mortgage securities but may close a contract
	prior to settlement or roll settlement to a later date if deemed to be in the
	best interest of shareholders. Actual mortgages received by the fund may be less
	favorable than those anticipated. The fund accounts for dollar roll transactions
	as purchases and sales, which has the effect of increasing its portfolio
	turnover rate.





	Securities Lending



	The fund may lend its securities to approved brokers to earn
	additional income. Its securities lending activities are administered by a
	lending agent in accordance with a securities lending agreement. Security loans
	generally do not have stated maturity dates, and the fund may recall a security
	at any time. The fund receives collateral in the form of cash or U.S. government
	securities, valued at 102% to 105% of the value of the securities on loan.
	Collateral is maintained over the life of the loan in an amount not less than
	the value of loaned securities; any additional collateral required due to
	changes in security values is delivered to the fund the next business day. Cash
	collateral is invested by the lending agent(s) in accordance with investment
	guidelines approved by fund management. Additionally, the lending agent
	indemnifies the fund against losses resulting from borrower default. Although
	risk is mitigated by the collateral and indemnification, the fund could


	experience a delay in recovering its securities
	and a possible loss of income or value if the borrower fails to return the
	securities, collateral investments decline in value, and the lending agent fails
	to perform. Securities lending revenue consists of earnings on invested
	collateral and borrowing fees, net of any rebates to the borrower, compensation
	to the lending agent, and other administrative costs. In accordance with GAAP,
	investments made with cash collateral are reflected in the accompanying
	financial statements, but collateral received in the form of securities is not.
	At April 30, 2016, the value of loaned securities was $17,061,000; the value of
	cash collateral and related investments was $17,554,000.





	Mortgage-Backed Securities



	The fund may invest in mortgage-backed
	securities (MBS or pass-through certificates) that represent an interest in a
	pool of specific underlying mortgage loans and entitle the fund to the periodic
	payments of principal and interest from those mortgages. MBS may be issued by
	government agencies or corporations, or private issuers. Most MBS issued by
	government agencies are guaranteed; however, the degree of protection differs
	based on the issuer. MBS are sensitive to changes in economic conditions that
	affect the rate of prepayments and defaults on the underlying mortgages;
	accordingly, the value, income, and related cash flows from MBS may be more
	volatile than other debt instruments.





	Other



	Purchases and sales of portfolio securities other than short-term
	securities aggregated $48,915,000 and $28,338,000, respectively, for the six
	months ended April 30, 2016. Purchases and sales of U.S. government securities
	aggregated $260,067,000 and $244,488,000, respectively, for the six months ended
	April 30, 2016.





	NOTE 4 - FEDERAL INCOME
	TAXES





	No provision for federal income taxes is
	required since the fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment
	company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code and distribute to
	shareholders all of its taxable income and gains. Distributions determined in
	accordance with federal income tax regulations may differ in amount or character
	from net investment income and realized gains for financial reporting purposes.
	Financial reporting records are adjusted for permanent book/tax differences to
	reflect tax character but are not adjusted for temporary differences. The amount
	and character of tax-basis distributions and composition of net assets are
	finalized at fiscal year-end; accordingly, tax-basis balances have not been
	determined as of the date of this report.




	At April 30, 2016, the cost of investments
	for federal income tax purposes was $663,206,000. Net unrealized gain aggregated
	$24,822,000 at period-end, of which $26,596,000 related to appreciated
	investments and $1,774,000 related to depreciated investments.





	NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY
	TRANSACTIONS





	The fund is managed by T. Rowe Price
	Associates, Inc. (Price Associates), a wholly owned subsidiary of T. Rowe Price
	Group, Inc. (Price Group). The investment management and administrative
	agreement between the fund and Price Associates provides for an all-inclusive
	annual fee equal to 0.30% of the funds average daily net assets. The fee is
	computed daily and paid monthly. The all-inclusive fee covers investment
	management, shareholder servicing, transfer agency, accounting, and custody
	services provided to the fund, as well as fund directors fees and expenses.
	Interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses are paid
	directly by the fund.




	Additionally, the fund is one of several
	mutual funds in which certain college savings plans managed by Price Associates
	may invest. As approved by the funds Board of Directors, shareholder servicing
	costs associated with each college savings plan are allocated to the fund in
	proportion to the average daily value of its shares owned by the college savings
	plan. Shareholder servicing costs allocated to the fund are borne by Price
	Associates, pursuant to the funds all-inclusive fee agreement. At April 30,
	2016, approximately 10% of the outstanding shares of the fund were held by
	college savings plans.




	In addition, other mutual funds, trusts,
	and other accounts managed by Price Associates or its affiliates (collectively,
	Price funds and accounts) may invest in the fund; however, no Price fund or
	account may invest for the purpose of exercising management or control over the
	fund. At April 30, 2016, approximately 2% of the funds outstanding shares were
	held by Price funds and accounts.




	The fund may invest in the T. Rowe Price
	Reserve Investment Fund, the T. Rowe Price Government Reserve Investment Fund,
	or the T. Rowe Price Short-Term Reserve Fund (collectively, the Price Reserve
	Investment Funds), open-end management investment companies managed by Price
	Associates and considered affiliates of the fund. The Price Reserve Investment
	Funds are offered as short-term investment options to mutual funds, trusts, and
	other accounts managed by Price Associates or its affiliates and are not
	available for direct purchase by members of the public. The Price Reserve
	Investment Funds pay no investment management fees.




	The fund may participate in securities
	purchase and sale transactions with other funds or accounts advised by Price
	Associates (cross trades), in accordance with procedures adopted by the funds
	Board and Securities and Exchange Commission rules, which require, among other
	things, that such purchase and sale cross trades be effected at the independent
	current market price of the security. During the six months ended April 30,
	2016, the fund had no purchases or sales cross trades with other funds or
	accounts advised by Price Associates.

	Approval of
	Investment Management Agreement








	On March 11, 2016, the funds Board of
	Directors (Board), including a majority of the funds independent directors,
	approved the continuation of the investment management agreement (Advisory
	Contract) between the fund and its investment advisor, T. Rowe Price Associates,
	Inc. (Advisor). In connection with its deliberations, the Board requested, and
	the Advisor provided, such information as the Board (with advice from
	independent legal counsel) deemed reasonably necessary. The Board considered a
	variety of factors in connection with its review of the Advisory Contract, also
	taking into account information provided by the Advisor during the course of the
	year, as discussed below:





	Services Provided by the
	Advisor




	The Board considered the nature,
	quality, and extent of the services provided to the fund by the Advisor. These
	services included, but were not limited to, directing the funds investments in
	accordance with its investment program and the overall management of the funds
	portfolio, as well as a variety of related activities such as financial,
	investment operations, and administrative services; compliance; maintaining the
	funds records and registrations; and shareholder communications. The Board also
	reviewed the background and experience of the Advisors senior management team
	and investment personnel involved in the management of the fund, as well as the
	Advisors compliance record. The Board concluded that it was satisfied with the
	nature, quality, and extent of the services provided by the Advisor.





	Investment Performance of the
	Fund




	The Board reviewed the funds
	three-month, one-year, and year-by-year returns, as well as the funds average
	annualized total returns over the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, and compared
	these returns with a wide variety of previously agreed-upon comparable
	performance measures and market data, including those supplied by Lipper and
	Morningstar, which are independent providers of mutual fund data.




	On the basis of this evaluation and the
	Boards ongoing review of investment results, and factoring in the relative
	market conditions during certain of the performance periods, the Board concluded
	that the funds performance was satisfactory.





	Costs, Benefits, Profits, and Economies
	of Scale




	The Board reviewed detailed
	information regarding the revenues received by the Advisor under the Advisory
	Contract and other benefits that the Advisor (and its affiliates) may have
	realized from its relationship with the fund, including any research received
	under soft dollar agreements and commission-sharing arrangements with
	broker-dealers. The Board considered that the Advisor may receive some benefit
	from soft-dollar arrangements pursuant to which research is received from
	broker-dealers that execute the applicable funds portfolio transactions. The
	Board received information on the estimated costs incurred and profits realized
	by the Advisor from managing T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The Board also reviewed
	estimates of the profits realized from managing the fund in particular, and the
	Board concluded that the Advisors profits were reasonable in light of the
	services provided to the fund.




	The Board also considered whether the fund
	benefits under the fee levels set forth in the Advisory Contract from any
	economies of scale realized by the Advisor. The Board noted that, under the
	Advisory Contract, the fund pays the Advisor a single fee, or all-inclusive
	management fee, which is based on the funds average daily net assets. The
	all-inclusive management fee includes investment management services and
	provides for the Advisor to pay all of the funds ordinary, recurring operating
	expenses except for interest, taxes, portfolio transaction fees, and any
	nonrecurring extraordinary expenses that may arise. The Board concluded that,
	based on the profitability data it reviewed and consistent with this
	all-inclusive management fee structure, the Advisory Contract provided for a
	reasonable sharing of any benefits from economies of scale with the
	fund.





	Fees




	The Board was provided with information regarding industry trends in
	management fees and expenses, and the Board reviewed the funds management fee
	rate and total expense ratio in comparison with fees and expenses of other
	comparable funds based on information and data supplied by Lipper. For these
	purposes, the Board assumed that the funds management fee rate was equal to the
	all-inclusive management fee rate less the funds actual operating expenses, and
	the total expense ratio was equal to the all-inclusive management fee rate. The
	information provided to the Board indicated that the funds management fee rate
	was at or below the median for comparable funds and the funds total expense
	ratio was above the median for comparable funds.




	The Board also reviewed the fee schedules
	for institutional accounts and private accounts with similar mandates that are
	advised or subadvised by the Advisor and its affiliates. Management provided the
	Board with information about the Advisors responsibilities and services
	provided to subadvisory and other institutional account clients, including
	information about how the requirements and economics of the institutional
	business are fundamentally different from those of the mutual fund business. The
	Board considered information showing that the Advisors mutual fund business is
	generally more complex from a business and compliance perspective than its
	institutional account business, and considered various relevant factors, such as
	the broader scope of operations and oversight, more extensive shareholder
	communication infrastructure, greater asset flows, heightened business risks,
	and differences in applicable laws and regulations associated with the Advisors
	proprietary mutual fund business. In assessing the reasonableness of the funds
	management fee rate, the Board considered the differences in the nature of the
	services required for the Advisor to manage its mutual fund business versus
	managing a discrete pool of assets as a subadvisor to another institutions
	mutual fund or for an institutional account, and that the Advisor generally
	performs significant additional services and assumes greater risk in managing
	the fund and other T. Rowe Price mutual funds than it does for institutional
	account clients.




	On the basis of the information provided
	and the factors considered, the Board concluded that the fees paid by the fund
	under the Advisory Contract are reasonable.





	Approval of the Advisory
	Contract




	As noted, the Board approved the
	continuation of the Advisory Contract. No single factor was considered in
	isolation or to be determinative to the decision. Rather, the Board concluded,
	in light of a weighting and balancing of all factors considered, that it was in
	the best interests of the fund and its shareholders for the Board to approve the
	continuation of the Advisory Contract (including the fees to be charged for
	services thereunder). The independent directors were advised throughout the
	process by independent legal counsel.
