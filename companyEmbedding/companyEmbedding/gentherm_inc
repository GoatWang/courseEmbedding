					Full Description



Gentherm Incorporated (Gentherm), incorporated on March 23, 2005, is a global technology company engaged in the design, development, and manufacturing of thermal management technologies. The Company has two segments: Automotive and Industrial. Its products provide solutions for automotive passenger comfort and convenience, battery thermal management, remote power generation, patient temperature management, environmental product testing and other consumer and industrial temperature control needs. Its automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America, Europe and Asia. It operates in locations aligned with its customers' product strategies in order to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities and to identify future thermal technology product opportunities in both automotive and other markets. Its expertise in thermal management is focused on two general areas: managing the thermal conditions of people and objects and managing the thermal energy conversion to electrical energy.The Company's technologies include Thermoelectric Technologies, Resistive Heaters, Electronics, Automotive Cable Systems, Air Moving Devices, Refrigeration Systems and Other Technologies. Its thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people and objects using its internally developed advanced thermoelectric device (TED) technology. Its Resistive heater technologies comprises wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (PTC) heating elements, which deliver heat to people and objects. It manufactures and supplies electronics to its core thermal seat comfort, interior comfort and thermal convenience products. It produces automotive cable systems used to connect automotive components to sources of power. It offers cable systems as integrated parts of its products and also as standalone components for other automotive applications, such as oxygen sensors. Its cable systems business includes both ready-made individual cables and ready-to-install cable networks. Its quiet air moving devices, including its blower and fan designs, are essential to all of its products that require air movement. Its refrigeration systems are used in environmental test chambers to cool various products.The Company's products include Seat Comfort, such as Climate Control Seat and Heated Seat; Thermal Convenience, such as TrueTherm Cup Holder and TrueTherm Storage Unit; Interior Comfort, such as Heated Steering Wheel and Heated Door and Armrest; Battery Thermal Management (BTM); Remote Power Generation; Patient Temperature Management Systems; Environmental Testing Equipment and Testing Services; Heated and Cooled Sleep Systems, and Heated and Cooled Office Chair. Its Climate Control Seats (CCS) products utilize technology to regulate temperature and enhance the comfort of vehicle passengers. The TrueTherm cup holder applies its TED technologies to keep beverages of automobile drivers and passengers either warm or cool. It has developed a range of cup holder models with varying degrees of functionality, designed to be packaged in multiple configurations to accommodate different console environments. Its dual independent design provides separate temperature settings in each holder allowing the driver and passenger to individually maintain a heated or cooled beverage.TrueTherm storage units provide for food or beverage cooling for the global automotive market. Using TED and other technologies, the TrueTherm cool storage unit provides temperature control independently from a vehicle's heating and air conditioning system. It can be custom designed to accommodate tight interior spaces and provide additional cooling capacity to those having long work commutes or transport multiple passengers. TrueTherm cool storage units are available in the front floor console of several sport utility vehicle (SUV) vehicles.

Its thermally conductive door panel armrest and center console armrest are powered by technologies used in its seat heating products. Its BTM system can provide precision battery cooling on pack or cell-level using patented TED technology. The BTM system maintains the temperature of the lithium-ion battery or other chemistry battery within an acceptable temperature range without the use of chilled liquids or refrigerant loops. It is a provider of remote electric power generation systems, primarily serving upstream and midstream oil and gas markets. Using its industrial TEG technologies, its generation systems deliver ultra-reliable power for long-term unattended operation in geographically remote applications that are critical to its customers' operations, such as wellhead automation, valve automation and cathodic protection of pipelines.The Company designs and produces turnkey systems that are customized for application, load, power and fuel source, and location requirements. Other applications for its remote power generation systems include mobile telecommunications, security and surveillance and scientific monitoring. It provides a full line of patient temperature management systems designed to manage patient body temperatures in operating rooms, recovery rooms, intensive care units and other areas of hospitals, as well as for use in the home healthcare market. It provides standard and custom designed environmental test chambers that execute reliability tests by subjecting products to environmental extremes, such as temperature, humidity, altitude, and vibration. Its heated and cooled sleep system solution incorporates its Climate Control Sleep System (CCSS) technology.AutomotiveThe Automotive segment comprises the results from its global automotive businesses and individual convenience products. Operating results from its automotive seat comfort systems, specialized automotive cable systems and other automotive and non-automotive thermal convenience products are all reported in the automotive segment because of their complementary focus on automotive content and/or individual comfort and convenience.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FAQ

 




Q. Does the MicroClimate Sleep System require maintenance?Q. Will the comfort of the mattress be compromised because of the MicroClimate Technology?Q. Can I use a mattress pad or a protector with the mattress?Q. Does the MicroClimate Sleep System require unique bed dressing?Q. Does the MicroClimate Sleep System include a warranty?Q. Can the temperature be independently controlled from each side?Q. What is the temperature range that the MicroClimate Sleep System can perform to?


Q. Does the MicroClimate Sleep System require maintenance?A. No maintenance is required because the MicroClimate Sleep System utilizes air to provide cooling and heating to the sleep surface. As such, no fluids, or compressed gasses are required to provide the desired thermal output. The only maintenance required of the Climate Sleep System would be the need to change remote batteries and periodically rotate the mattress!
Q. Will the comfort of the mattress be compromised because of the MicroClimate Technology?A. Absolutely not. The first priority of the mattress is to provide a comfortable sleep environment. Our proprietary air distribution system used in conjunction with the highest quality bedding materials provides world class pressure relief and thermal management. The cooling and heating hardware is located in the foundation, far away from the occupant, and does not require the use of bulky mats on the surface of the bed.
Q. Can I use a mattress pad or a protector with the mattress?A. Because of the nature of the product (using air to cool or heat the occupant), mattress covers are not recommended. However, we've designed the Climate Sleep System such that mattress covers will soon be a thing of the past! Our cover and foam layers are all treated with anti-microbial agents. Delivering thermal comfort via air also creates a dry environment which is proven to reduce the proliferation of dust mites and other unwanted organisms. Finally, the cover is replaceable meaning you have the option to replace as often as you please!
Q. Does the MicroClimate Sleep System require unique bed dressing?A. Not necessarily. We all know how important the “feel” of the sheets are to the sleep experience. Understanding this requirement, our technology has been tested with a wide variety of sheet styles and constructions. Jersey knit sheets provide the best performance. In general, the more “breathable” the sheets, the better the performance.
Q. Does the MicroClimate Sleep System include a warranty?A. Yes! The technology in your MicroClimate Sleep System has roots in the automotive industry and has been designed to the highest product reliability and safety standards. Terms of the Warranty are located on this website.
Q. Can the temperature be independently controlled from each side?A. Yes. All individuals have their own thermal needs. Because of this, our MicroClimate Sleep System is designed to offer independent control without the worry of affecting your sleep partner's personal microclimate.
Q. What is the temperature range that the MicroClimate Sleep System can perform to?A. Performance will vary with room temperature and bed dressing, but the Sleep System is designed to cool to 60 °F and heat to 104 °F
