Item 15.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers  The following summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the complete text of the statutes referred to below, the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Regulations of M/I Homes, Inc. (“M/I Homes”) and the organizational documents of
each of the co-registrants.  M/I Homes, Inc. 
Under Section 1701.13(E) of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the “OGCL”), directors, officers, employees and agents of an Ohio
corporation have an absolute right to indemnification for expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by them in any action, suit or proceeding to the extent they are successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense
of the action, suit or proceeding, including derivative actions, brought against them, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter asserted in any such proceeding. 
Section 1701.13(E) of the OGCL permits a corporation to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents or individuals who are or
were serving at the request of the corporation as a director, trustee, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation or entity in circumstances where indemnification is not mandated by the statute if certain statutory standards
are satisfied. A corporation may grant indemnification in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, investigative or administrative, other than derivative actions, if the indemnitee acted in good faith
and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such
indemnification is permitted against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) as well as judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in connection with the action, suit or proceeding. 
Under Section 1701.13(E), a corporation may also provide indemnification in derivative actions for expenses (including attorneys’
fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of an action or suit if the officer, director, employee or agent acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the
best interests of the corporation. Ohio law does not 
  II-1




expressly authorize indemnification against judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of derivative actions. A corporation may not indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent in
derivative actions for expenses (including attorneys’ fees) if such person is adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of such person’s duties to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that a court
determines that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity as the court deems proper. In addition, a corporation may not indemnify a director
in any action or suit in which the only liability asserted against the director is for approving unlawful loans, dividends or distributions of assets under Section 1701.95 of the OGCL. 
Section 1701.13(E) of the OGCL permits a corporation to pay expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by a director, officer,
employee or agent as they are incurred, in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, as authorized by the corporation’s directors and upon receipt of an undertaking by such person to repay such amount if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.  Section 1701.13(E) of the OGCL states that the
indemnification provided thereby is not exclusive of, and is in addition to, any other rights granted to persons seeking indemnification under a corporation’s articles or regulations, any agreement, a vote of the corporation’s shareholders
or disinterested directors, or otherwise. In addition, Section 1701.13(E) of the OGCL grants express power to a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar protection, including trust funds, letters of credit and
self-insurance, for director, officer, employee or agent liability, regardless of whether that individual is otherwise eligible for indemnification by the corporation. 
M/I Homes’ Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles”) provide that M/I Homes shall, to the fullest extent
not prohibited by law, indemnify each director and officer against any and all costs and expenses (including attorney fees, judgments, fines, penalties, amounts paid in settlement, and other disbursements) actually and reasonably incurred by or
imposed upon such person in connection with any action, suit, investigation or proceeding (or any claim or other matter therein), whether civil, criminal, administrative or otherwise in nature, including any settlements or appeals thereof, with
respect to which such person is named or otherwise becomes or is threatened to be made a party by reason of being or at any time having been a director or officer of M/I Homes, or by any reason of being or at any time having been, while such a
director or officer, an employee or other agent of M/I Homes or, at the direction or request of M/I Homes, a director, trustee, officer, administrator, manager, employee, adviser or other agent of or fiduciary for any other corporation, partnership,
trust, venture or other entity or enterprise (including any employee benefit plan). The Articles further provide that (i) M/I Homes shall indemnify any other person to the extent such person is entitled to indemnification under Ohio law by
reason of being successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of an action to which such person is named a party by reason of being an employee or other agent of M/I Homes and (ii) M/I Homes may further indemnify any such person if it is
determined by the board of directors of M/I Homes that indemnification is proper in the specific case.  Under M/I Homes’ Amended and
Restated Regulations (the “Regulations”), M/I Homes shall indemnify any officer or director who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including any derivative action), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of M/I Homes, or is or was serving at the request of M/I Homes as a director,
trustee, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees, filing fees, court reporters’ fees
and transcript costs), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of M/I Homes. A person claiming such indemnification shall be presumed, in respect of any act or omission giving rise to such claim for indemnification, to have acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of M/I Homes. The Regulations state that any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made only upon

  II-2




a determination that the director or officer has met the applicable standard of conduct, and such determination shall be made (i) by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of disinterested
directors, (ii) in a written opinion by qualified independent legal counsel or (iii) by the shareholders.  The Regulations
provide that, to the extent that an officer or director has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding, such person shall be promptly indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees, filing
fees, court reporters’ fees and transcript costs) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. The Regulations further provide that expenses (including attorneys’ fees, filing fees, court reporters’ fees
and transcript costs) incurred in defending any action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by M/I Homes in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding to or on behalf of the officer or director promptly as such expenses are
incurred by such person if (i) in respect of any claim (except one in which the only liability asserted against a director is for approving unlawful loans, dividends or distribution of assets under Section 1701.95 of the OGCL), M/I Homes
receives an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, in which such person agrees to repay all such amounts if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that such person’s action or failure to act
involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to M/I Homes or with reckless disregard for the best interests of M/I Homes, and such person agrees to cooperate reasonably with M/I Homes concerning the action, suit or
proceeding, or (ii) M/I Homes receives an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer in which such person agrees to repay all such amounts if it ultimately is determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified. 
The Regulations state that the indemnification provided thereby is not exclusive of, and is in addition to, any other rights to which any
person seeking indemnification may be entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. Additionally, the Regulations provide that M/I Homes may purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar
protection, including trust funds, letters of credit, or self-insurance, on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of M/I Homes, or is or was serving at the request of M/I Homes as a director, trustee, officer,
employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in such capacity, or arising
out of such person’s status as such, whether or not M/I Homes would have the obligation or the power to indemnify such person under the Regulations. 
Co-Registrants  Certain officers and
other employees of M/I Homes serve at the request of M/I Homes as a director, officer, employee or agent of the co-registrants, and thus may be entitled to indemnification under the provisions set forth above. In addition to potential
indemnification by M/I Homes, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the co-registrants are also entitled to indemnification to the extent provided in the applicable co-registrant’s organizational documents or under the laws under
which the applicable co-registrant is organized as described below.  Delaware Limited Liability Companies 
Section 18-108 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that, subject to such standards and restrictions, if any, as set

Chapter 2, Section 9 of the Indiana Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that a domestic or foreign limited partnership may
indemnify a person made a party to an action because the person is or was a partner, employee, officer or agent of the partnership against liability incurred in the action if (i) the person’s conduct was in good faith and (ii) the
person reasonably believed (A) in the case of conduct in the person’s capacity as a partner, that the person’s conduct was in the best interests of the partnership and (B) in all other cases, that the person’s conduct was at
least not opposed to the best interests of the limited partnership or foreign limited partnership and (iii) in the case of any criminal action, the person either (A) had reasonable cause to believe the person’s conduct was lawful or
(B) had no reasonable cause to believe the person’s conduct was unlawful. The foregoing provisions do not exclude any other rights to indemnification that a partner, employee, officer, or agent of the domestic or foreign limited
partnership may have under the partnership agreement or with the written consent of all partners. To the extent it is not inconsistent with the foregoing, Section 18 of the Indiana Uniform Partnership Act provides that, subject to any agreement

Item 16.
Exhibits  See the Exhibit Index attached to this Registration Statement, which is
incorporated herein by reference.
  


Item 17.
Undertakings   


 
(a)
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:   


 
(1)
To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made of the securities registered hereby, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement; 
 


 
(i)
To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;   


 
(ii)
To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a
fundamental change in the information set forth in the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which
was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price
represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and 
 


 
(iii)
To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the Registration Statement or any material change to such information in the Registration Statement;
 provided, however, that the undertakings set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) above do not
apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is a part of the registration statement. 
 


 
(2)
That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and
the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.   


 
(3)
To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 
 


 
(4)
That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:   


 
(i)
Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the field prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration
statement; and 
  II-7





 
(ii)
Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or
(x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first
used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such
date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the
registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or
prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.   


 
(5)
That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a
primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by
means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: 
 


 
(i)
Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; 
 


 
(ii)
Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; 
 


 
(iii)
The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and
  


 
(iv)
Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. 
(b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
filing of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to
Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such
securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
 (c) The undersigned registrant hereby
undertakes to supplement the prospectus, after the expiration of the subscription period, to set forth the results of the subscription offer, the transactions by the underwriters during the subscription period, the amount of unsubscribed securities
to be purchased by the underwriters, and the terms of any subsequent reoffering thereof. If any public offering by the underwriters is to be made on terms differing from those set forth on the cover page of the prospectus, a post-effective amendment
will be filed to set forth the terms of such offering. 
  II-8



(d) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may
be permitted to directors, officers or controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the
opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the
final adjudication of such issue.  (e) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: 
 


 
(1)
For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a
form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. 
 


 
(2)
For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 
(f) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act
under subsection (a) of Section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act (the “Act”) in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under Section 305(b)(2) of the Act. 
  II-9

Box 68, Prince George, Virginia 23875. Our office is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.
All payments should be made payable to:
Treasurer of Prince George CountyP.O. Box 175Prince George, VA  23875

	Item 15.




	Indemnification of Directors and Officers





	The following summary is qualified in its
	entirety by reference to the complete text of the statutes referred to below, the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Regulations of M/I Homes, Inc. (M/I Homes) and the organizational documents of
	each of the co-registrants.



	M/I Homes, Inc.



	Under Section 1701.13(E) of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the OGCL), directors, officers, employees and agents of an Ohio
	corporation have an absolute right to indemnification for expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by them in any action, suit or proceeding to the extent they are successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense
	of the action, suit or proceeding, including derivative actions, brought against them, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter asserted in any such proceeding.


	Section 1701.13(E) of the OGCL permits a corporation to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents or individuals who are or
	were serving at the request of the corporation as a director, trustee, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation or entity in circumstances where indemnification is not mandated by the statute if certain statutory standards
	are satisfied. A corporation may grant indemnification in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, investigative or administrative, other than derivative actions, if the indemnitee acted in good faith
	and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such
	indemnification is permitted against expenses (including attorneys fees) as well as judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in connection with the action, suit or proceeding.


	Under Section 1701.13(E), a corporation may also provide indemnification in derivative actions for expenses (including attorneys
	fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of an action or suit if the officer, director, employee or agent acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the
	best interests of the corporation. Ohio law does not


	 


	II-1





	expressly authorize indemnification against judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of derivative actions. A corporation may not indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent in
	derivative actions for expenses (including attorneys fees) if such person is adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of such persons duties to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that a court
	determines that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity as the court deems proper. In addition, a corporation may not indemnify a director
	in any action or suit in which the only liability asserted against the director is for approving unlawful loans, dividends or distributions of assets under Section 1701.95 of the OGCL.


	Section 1701.13(E) of the OGCL permits a corporation to pay expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a director, officer,
	employee or agent as they are incurred, in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, as authorized by the corporations directors and upon receipt of an undertaking by such person to repay such amount if it is
	ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.


	Section 1701.13(E) of the OGCL states that the
	indemnification provided thereby is not exclusive of, and is in addition to, any other rights granted to persons seeking indemnification under a corporations articles or regulations, any agreement, a vote of the corporations shareholders
	or disinterested directors, or otherwise. In addition, Section 1701.13(E) of the OGCL grants express power to a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar protection, including trust funds, letters of credit and
	self-insurance, for director, officer, employee or agent liability, regardless of whether that individual is otherwise eligible for indemnification by the corporation.


	M/I Homes Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles) provide that M/I Homes shall, to the fullest extent
	not prohibited by law, indemnify each director and officer against any and all costs and expenses (including attorney fees, judgments, fines, penalties, amounts paid in settlement, and other disbursements) actually and reasonably incurred by or
	imposed upon such person in connection with any action, suit, investigation or proceeding (or any claim or other matter therein), whether civil, criminal, administrative or otherwise in nature, including any settlements or appeals thereof, with
	respect to which such person is named or otherwise becomes or is threatened to be made a party by reason of being or at any time having been a director or officer of M/I Homes, or by any reason of being or at any time having been, while such a
	director or officer, an employee or other agent of M/I Homes or, at the direction or request of M/I Homes, a director, trustee, officer, administrator, manager, employee, adviser or other agent of or fiduciary for any other corporation, partnership,
	trust, venture or other entity or enterprise (including any employee benefit plan). The Articles further provide that (i) M/I Homes shall indemnify any other person to the extent such person is entitled to indemnification under Ohio law by
	reason of being successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of an action to which such person is named a party by reason of being an employee or other agent of M/I Homes and (ii) M/I Homes may further indemnify any such person if it is
	determined by the board of directors of M/I Homes that indemnification is proper in the specific case.


	Under M/I Homes Amended and
	Restated Regulations (the Regulations), M/I Homes shall indemnify any officer or director who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
	criminal, administrative or investigative (including any derivative action), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of M/I Homes, or is or was serving at the request of M/I Homes as a director,
	trustee, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees, filing fees, court reporters fees
	and transcript costs), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably
	believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of M/I Homes. A person claiming such indemnification shall be presumed, in respect of any act or omission giving rise to such claim for indemnification, to have acted in good faith and in a
	manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of M/I Homes. The Regulations state that any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made only upon


	 


	II-2





	a determination that the director or officer has met the applicable standard of conduct, and such determination shall be made (i) by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of disinterested
	directors, (ii) in a written opinion by qualified independent legal counsel or (iii) by the shareholders.


	The Regulations
	provide that, to the extent that an officer or director has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding, such person shall be promptly indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees, filing
	fees, court reporters fees and transcript costs) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. The Regulations further provide that expenses (including attorneys fees, filing fees, court reporters fees
	and transcript costs) incurred in defending any action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by M/I Homes in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding to or on behalf of the officer or director promptly as such expenses are
	incurred by such person if (i) in respect of any claim (except one in which the only liability asserted against a director is for approving unlawful loans, dividends or distribution of assets under Section 1701.95 of the OGCL), M/I Homes
	receives an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, in which such person agrees to repay all such amounts if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that such persons action or failure to act
	involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to M/I Homes or with reckless disregard for the best interests of M/I Homes, and such person agrees to cooperate reasonably with M/I Homes concerning the action, suit or
	proceeding, or (ii) M/I Homes receives an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer in which such person agrees to repay all such amounts if it ultimately is determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified.


	The Regulations state that the indemnification provided thereby is not exclusive of, and is in addition to, any other rights to which any
	person seeking indemnification may be entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. Additionally, the Regulations provide that M/I Homes may purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar
	protection, including trust funds, letters of credit, or self-insurance, on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of M/I Homes, or is or was serving at the request of M/I Homes as a director, trustee, officer,
	employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in such capacity, or arising
	out of such persons status as such, whether or not M/I Homes would have the obligation or the power to indemnify such person under the Regulations.



	Co-Registrants



	Certain officers and
	other employees of M/I Homes serve at the request of M/I Homes as a director, officer, employee or agent of the co-registrants, and thus may be entitled to indemnification under the provisions set forth above. In addition to potential
	indemnification by M/I Homes, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the co-registrants are also entitled to indemnification to the extent provided in the applicable co-registrants organizational documents or under the laws under
	which the applicable co-registrant is organized as described below.

	person reasonably believed (A) in the case of conduct in the persons capacity as a partner, that the persons conduct was in the best interests of the partnership and (B) in all other cases, that the persons conduct was at

	partnership must advance expenses associated with defense of any related action; provided, however, that this indemnity does not apply to actions constituting bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or a breach of the provisions of the
	limited partnership agreement or actions as to which the conduct of such person was not in the best interests of the partnership or the person had reasonable cause to believe the action was unlawful.

	Ohio Limited Liability Companies



	Section 1705.32 of the Ohio Limited Liability Company Act (the OLLCA) provides that a limited liability company may
	indemnify any person who was or is a party, or who is threatened to be made a party, to any action, suit or proceeding because such person is or was a manager, member, partner, officer, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the
	companys request as a manager, director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement that were actually and reasonably incurred by
	such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company and, in connection with any criminal
	action or proceeding, such person had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. In the case of an action or suit by or in the right of the company to procure a judgment in its favor, a limited liability company may
	indemnify such person against expenses (including attorneys fees) that were actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner
	such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person is adjudged to be liable for
	negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duty to the company unless and only to the extent that the court of common pleas or the court in which the action or suit was brought determines, upon application, that, despite the
	adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for expenses that the court considers proper. To the extent that a manager , officer, employee or agent of a
	limited liability company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, proceeding, claim, issue or matter referred to above, the limited liability company must indemnify such person against expenses (including
	attorneys fees) that were actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding. The indemnification authorized by Section 1705.32 of the OLLCA is not exclusive of and shall be in addition to
	any other rights granted to those seeking indemnification, both as to action in their official capacities and as to action in another capacity while holding their offices or positions. Section 1705.32 of the OLLCA also provides that a limited
	liability company may purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar protection for or on behalf of any person who is or was a manager, director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of the company or who is or was serving at the request of the
	company as a manager, director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity.

	Item 17.




	Undertakings





	 




	 


	(a)


	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	 




	 


	(1)


	To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made of the securities registered hereby, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement;




	 




	 


	(i)


	To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




	 




	 


	(ii)


	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a
	fundamental change in the information set forth in the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which
	was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price
	represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and




	 




	 


	(iii)


	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the Registration Statement or any material change to such information in the Registration Statement;





	provided, however

	, that the undertakings set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) above do not
	apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is a part of the registration statement.


	 




	 


	(2)


	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and
	the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.




	 




	 


	(3)


	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.




	 




	 


	(4)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:




	 




	 


	(i)


	Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the field prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration
	statement; and




	 


	II-7







	 


	(ii)


	Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or
	(x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first
	used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such
	date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
	initial bona fide offering thereof.

	Provided, however

	, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the
	registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or
	prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.




	 




	 


	(5)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a
	primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by
	means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:




	 




	 


	(i)


	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;




	 




	 


	(ii)


	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;




	 




	 


	(iii)


	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and




	 




	 


	(iv)


	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	(b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
	filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to
	Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such
	securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.


	(c) The undersigned registrant hereby
	undertakes to supplement the prospectus, after the expiration of the subscription period, to set forth the results of the subscription offer, the transactions by the underwriters during the subscription period, the amount of unsubscribed securities
	to be purchased by the underwriters, and the terms of any subsequent reoffering thereof. If any public offering by the underwriters is to be made on terms differing from those set forth on the cover page of the prospectus, a post-effective amendment
	will be filed to set forth the terms of such offering.


	 


	II-8





	(d) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may
	be permitted to directors, officers or controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
	against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
	or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the
	opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the
	final adjudication of such issue.


	(e) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:


	 




	 


	(1)


	For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a
	form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.




	 




	 


	(2)


	For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
	securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	(f) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act
	under subsection (a) of Section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act (the Act) in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under Section 305(b)(2) of the Act.


	 


	II-9










	SIGNATURES



	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets
	all of the requirements for filing on Form S-3 and has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Columbus, State of Ohio, on December 13, 2013.

	Re:


	M/I Homes, Inc. Registration Statement on Form S-3




	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as counsel to M/I Homes, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the Company), in connection with the Registration Statement on
	Form S-3 (the Registration Statement) being filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) for the purpose of registering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
	Act), (i) debt securities of the Company, which may be either senior debt securities (the Senior Debt Securities) or subordinated debt securities (the Subordinated Debt Securities and, together with the Senior Debt
	Securities, the Debt Securities), and which may include guarantees of the Debt Securities (the Guarantees) by certain of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company (the Guarantors); (ii) common
	shares, par value $.01 per share (the Common Shares); (iii) preferred shares, par value $.01 per share (the Preferred Shares); (iv) Preferred Shares represented by depositary shares (the Depositary
	Shares); (v) warrants to purchase Debt Securities, Common Shares, Preferred Shares, Depositary Shares or units of two or more of such securities (the Warrants); (vi) rights to purchase Debt Securities, Common Shares,
	Preferred Shares or Depositary Shares offered to the Companys security holders (the Rights); (vii) stock purchase contracts (the Stock Purchase Contracts); and (viii) units consisting of one or more Debt
	Securities, Guarantees, Common Shares, Preferred Shares, Depositary Shares, Warrants, Rights, Stock Purchase Contracts or any combination of such securities (the Units). The Debt Securities, Guarantees, Common Shares, Preferred Shares,
	Depositary Shares, Warrants, Rights, Stock Purchase Contracts and Units are collectively referred to herein as the Securities. The Securities may be offered from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act as set
	forth in the Registration Statement, any amendment thereto, the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement (the Prospectus) and one or more supplements to the Prospectus (each, a Prospectus Supplement).


	The Senior Debt Securities and any related Guarantees will be issued under a senior debt indenture, the form of which is attached as an
	exhibit to the Registration Statement, by and among the Company, such Guarantors as shall be named therein and a trustee to be identified therein, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time (the Senior Debt





	December 13, 2013

	Indenture). The Subordinated Debt Securities and any related Guarantees will be issued under that
	certain Indenture, dated September 11, 2012, by and among the Company, the Guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time (the Subordinated Debt
	Indenture and, together with the Senior Debt Indenture, the Indentures). The Depositary Shares will be issued under one or more deposit agreements (each, a Deposit Agreement) by and between the Company and a financial
	institution to be identified therein as the depositary (each, a Depositary). The Company may issue receipts (Depositary Receipts) for Depositary Shares, each of which will represent a fractional interest of a Preferred Share
	represented by Depositary Shares. The Warrants will be issued under one or more warrant agreements (each, a Warrant Agreement) by and between the Company and a warrant agent to be identified therein (each, a Warrant Agent).
	The Rights will be issued under one or more rights agreements (each, a Rights Agreement) by and between the Company and a rights agent to be identified therein (each, a Rights Agent). The Stock Purchase Contracts will be
	issued under one or more stock purchase contract agreements (each, a Stock Purchase Contract Agreement) by and between the Company and a stock purchase contract agent to be identified therein (each, a Stock Purchase Contract
	Agent). The Units will be issued under one or more unit agreements (each, a Unit Agreement) by and between the Company and a unit agent to be identified therein (each, a Unit Agent).


	As such counsel, in rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined and relied without investigation as to matters of fact upon the
	Registration Statement and the exhibits thereto and such certificates, statements and results of inquiries of public officials and officers and representatives of the Company and originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our
	satisfaction, of such other documents, corporate records, certificates and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinions expressed herein. We have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on all
	documents examined by us, the legal competence and capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of documents submitted to us as originals, and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.


	Subject to the foregoing and the other matters and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof:


	(1) When the Senior Debt Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the applicable trustee, the Company and any applicable
	Guarantors, the specific terms of a particular series of Senior Debt Securities and any related Guarantees have been duly established by supplemental indenture, Board resolution or officers certificate in accordance with the Senior Debt
	Indenture and applicable law, any such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the applicable trustee, the Company and any applicable Guarantors and such Senior Debt Securities and any related Guarantees have been
	duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered against receipt of the requisite consideration therefor in accordance with the terms of the Senior Debt Indenture and the applicable underwriting, purchase or similar agreement (the
	Underwriting Agreement) or upon conversion or exercise

	of any Securities, in accordance with the terms of such Securities or the instrument governing such Securities providing for such conversion or exercise as approved by the Board of Directors (or

	of Preferred Shares, the Board has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the issuance and sale of the Preferred Shares proposed to be sold by the Company, and such Preferred Shares have been duly issued and delivered against receipt of

	The opinions set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) above are
	subject to the following exceptions, limitations and qualifications: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the
	rights or remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought;
	(iii) the enforceability under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary
	to public policy; and (iv) any requirement that a claim with respect to any Securities denominated other than in United States dollars (or a judgment denominated other than in United States dollars with respect to such a claim) be converted
	into United States dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant applicable law.


	We express no opinion
	(i) concerning the enforceability of (a) the waiver of rights or defenses contained in the Indentures, the Debt Securities or the Guarantees or (b) the Guarantees to the extent that the obligations underlying the Guarantees are
	materially modified without the consent of the applicable Guarantor or (ii) with respect to whether acceleration of the Debt Securities may affect the collectibility of any portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be
	determined to constitute unearned interest thereon.


	To the extent that the obligations of the Company or any applicable Guarantor under
	any Indenture, Deposit Agreement, Warrant Agreement, Rights Agreement, Stock Purchase Contract Agreement or Unit Agreement may be dependent upon such matters, we assume for purposes of this opinion that each trustee, Depositary, Warrant Agent,
	Rights Agent, Stock Purchase Contract Agent or Unit Agent, as applicable, will be duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; that each trustee, Depositary, Warrant Agent, Rights Agent,
	Stock Purchase Contract Agent or Unit Agent will be duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by the applicable Indenture, Deposit Agreement, Warrant Agreement, Rights Agreement, Stock Purchase Contract Agreement or Unit Agreement;
	that each Indenture, Deposit Agreement, Warrant Agreement, Rights Agreement, Stock Purchase Contract Agreement or Unit Agreement will be duly authorized, executed and delivered by the applicable trustee, Depositary, Warrant Agent, Rights Agent,
	Stock Purchase Contract Agent or Unit Agent and will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such trustee, Depositary, Warrant Agent, Rights Agent, Stock Purchase Contract Agent or Unit Agent enforceable against such trustee,
	Depositary, Warrant Agent, Rights Agent, Stock Purchase Contract Agent or Unit Agent in accordance with its terms; that each trustee, Depositary, Warrant Agent, Rights Agent, Stock Purchase Contract Agent or Unit Agent will be in compliance, at all
	applicable times and in all respects material to the applicable Indenture, Deposit Agreement, Warrant Agreement, Rights Agreement, Stock Purchase Contract Agreement or Unit Agreement, with all applicable laws and regulations; and that each trustee,
	Depositary, Warrant Agent, Rights Agent, Stock Purchase

	Contract Agent or Unit Agent will have the requisite organizational and legal power and authority to perform its obligations under the applicable Indenture, Deposit Agreement, Warrant Agreement,
	Rights Agreement, Stock Purchase Contract Agreement or Unit Agreement.


	In rendering the foregoing opinions, we have assumed that at the
	time of the issuance and sale of any of the Securities: (i) the Registration Statement, and any amendments thereto, will have become effective and such effectiveness will not have been terminated or rescinded; (ii) a Prospectus
	Supplement describing the Securities, to the extent required by applicable law and relevant rules and regulations of the Commission, will be timely filed with the Commission; (iii) the Board and the authorized governing bodies of the
	Guarantors, as applicable, will have duly established the terms of the Securities and duly authorized the issuance and sale of the Securities, in each case in accordance with the Articles or the constituent organizational documents of the
	Guarantors, as applicable, and applicable law and such authorization will be in full force and effect; (iv) the Securities will be issued and sold in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws and in the manner
	contemplated by the Registration Statement and the applicable Prospectus Supplement; (v) there shall not have occurred any change in law affecting the validity of the Securities; (vi) any Securities, including Common Shares or Preferred
	Shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of any other Security, will have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance from the applicable class of capital stock of the Company; (vii) with respect to Common Shares, there will be
	sufficient Common Shares authorized under the Articles, as in effect at the relevant time, and not otherwise reserved for issuance; (viii) with respect to Preferred Shares, there will be sufficient Preferred Shares authorized under the
	Articles, as in effect at the relevant time, and not otherwise reserved for issuance; and (ix) with respect to Senior Debt Securities and any related Guarantees, the applicable trustee shall have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of
	1939, as amended (the TIA), a Statement of Eligibility of the applicable trustee on Form T-1 shall have been properly filed with the Commission and the Indenture shall have been duly qualified under the TIA. We have also assumed that
	none of the terms of any Securities to be established subsequent to the date hereof, the issuance and delivery of any such Securities, or the compliance by the Company or any applicable Guarantor with the terms of such Securities will violate any
	applicable law or public policy or result in a violation of any provision of any instrument or agreement then binding upon the Company or any applicable Guarantor or any restriction imposed by any court or governmental body having jurisdiction over
	the Company or any applicable Guarantor.


	The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of Ohio and, solely with
	respect to the opinions set forth above in paragraphs (1) and (2), the laws of the States of Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, New York and Ohio, and we express no opinion with respect to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.


	The opinions expressed herein are based upon the law and circumstances as they are in effect on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation
	to revise or supplement this letter in the event of future changes in the law or interpretation thereof with respect to circumstances or events that may occur subsequent to the date hereof.


	We hereby consent to your filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to our firm under the
	caption Legal Matters in the Prospectus included therein. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the
	rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
