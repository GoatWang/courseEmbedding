 Overview
















David J. Wilson

President, Cordis


    

David Wilson is president of Cordis, a Cardinal Health company. In March 2015, Wilson was appointed as the President of Cordis, a Cardinal Health company. A 20-year veteran of Johnson & Johnson, Wilson brings strong leadership skills, deep industry experience, and direct knowledge of the Cordis business.





From 1996 to 2007, he served in a number of roles within Cordis, including vice president of Lower Extremity, Renal and Venous Diseases, vice president of Cordis Endovascular Research & Development, and regional sales director for the West.  During his 11-year tenure at Cordis, David helped to build Cordis Endovascular while gaining exposure to the Cardiology business, and developed a deep understanding of the company’s Research & Development and commercial organizations.
Before taking the helm of Cordis, David served as worldwide president of Mentor since his appointment in September 2010. During his time leading Mentor, the business regained its No. 1 worldwide market share leadership position; increased its focus on innovation by launching several market leading products; and re-focused on breast surgery, its core segment. 
Prior to joining Mentor, David was worldwide vice president of Research & Development and New Business Development for Ethicon, Inc. David joined Ethicon in 2007 as worldwide vice president of Biosurgicals for Johnson & Johnson Wound Management, now named Ethicon Biosurgery. Under his leadership, the business focused on globalization and product diversification to achieve and sustain double digit growth. Before beginning his career at Johnson & Johnson within Cordis in 1996, David worked at a start-up company, Cohesion Corporation, in Palo Alto, Calif.
David holds a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Auburn University, a master of science in biomedical engineering from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and a master of business administration from Columbia University. He holds numerous patents and was awarded the Johnson Medal for the creation of the Cordis Self-Expanding Stent System in 2001.
