Company - Rave Restaurant Group
















Company
RAVE Restaurant Group [NASDAQ: RAVE] is the home of two exciting brands: Pie Five Pizza Co., the nation’s leading fast casual pizza company, and Pizza Inn, one of the nation’s first dine-in pizza chains.
Formerly known as Pizza Inn Holdings, Inc., RAVE is a reflection of the company’s transformation from a single-branded restaurant company to a multi-brand portfolio group comprised of world-class restaurant operators.
Pie Five is setting the standard in the fast casual pizza segment with solid unit-level economics, double-digit comps and a strong pipeline of new corporate and franchise stores. More than 100 company-owned units are slated to open over the next 4-5 years, and total franchise store commitments will take them well over 400 restaurants in that same period.
Our flagship Pizza Inn brand currently operates more than 250 restaurants domestically and internationally. Pizza Inn has recorded two consecutive quarters of growth, and those trends are expected to continue. We have developed a strong partnership with our franchise leadership, and we are building the infrastructure to support consistent growth and performance.
Any way you slice it, RAVE Restaurant Group is a formidable player in the highly competitive, constantly evolving restaurant industry.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

 today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 ended September 25, 2016. 

        First Quarter Highlights
: 











Total consolidated revenue increased 6.3% to $15.5 million compared to $14.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  

                                    










Pie Five comparable store retail sales decreased 14.7% from the same period of the prior year. 

                                    










Pie Five system-wide retail sales increased 35.5%, while average weekly sales declined 12.8%, year over year. 

                                    










Pizza Inn domestic comparable store retail sales increased 0.2% from the same period of the prior year, while total domestic retail sales decreased by 1.6%. 

                                    










Net loss of $1.5 million was $0.9 million greater than the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to closed store expenses, lease termination costs and lower sales and financial performance by Company-owned Pie Five stores. 

                                    










On a fully diluted basis, the loss was $0.14 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to a loss of $0.05 per share for the same period of the prior year. 

                                    










Adjusted EBITDA of ($0.2) million was $0.4 million less than the same quarter of the prior year. 

                                    










Company-owned Pie Five operating cash flow decreased $0.6 million from the same period of the prior year. 

                                    










Net addition of four Pie Five restaurants during the quarter brought the total Pie Five restaurants open at the end of the quarter to 92.

                                    










"Sales trends continued to be very challenging in the first fiscal quarter for the Pie Five system while sales in the Pizza Inn system were comparatively stable, and these trends have continued so far in the current quarter," said Clinton Coleman, Interim Chief Executive Officer for Rave Restaurant Group, Inc.  "We are implementing several new service, product, and marketing initiatives to address these poor traffic trends at Pie Five, including the recent launch of online ordering."


                                        

First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Operating Results









Total revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and the comparable prior year quarter were $15.5 million and $14.5 million, respectively, an increase of 6.3% year over year.  Additional franchise development fees previously received from Pie Five franchisees have been deferred and will be recognized as future restaurants are opened.  Pizza Inn domestic comparable store retail sales increased 0.2% from the same period in the prior year. 


                                        








For Pie Five, system-wide retail sales increased 35.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 when compared to the same period in the prior year driven by a 57.9% increase in average units open, while system-wide average weekly sales decreased by 12.8%, year over year.  Comparable store retail sales decreased by 14.7% for the most recent fiscal quarter compared to the same period in the prior year.  The Pie Five comparable store retail sales were adversely impacted by restaurants recently entering the comparable store base having lower average sales than in prior years.   The Company believes that increased competition within the fast-casual segment and general industry softness contributed to weakened trends within the Pie Five system. 


                                        








"At Pie Five we are focused on making it faster and more convenient for our customers to get a consistently great personalized pizza," said Coleman. "Meanwhile, I'm pleased that Pizza Inn is performing relatively well in a tough dine-in restaurant environment, and the performance of recent new and remodeled franchised restaurants indicates a potential for establishing a sustainable growth path for the brand."


                                        

Development Review









In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, six new franchised Pie Five restaurants were opened, while one franchised and one Company restaurants were closed, bringing the fiscal quarter-end total unit count to 92 restaurants.  The Company signed two new franchise development agreements with an existing franchisee for up to 16 additional Pie Five restaurants in Louisiana and Nevada.  The Company currently has franchise restaurant development commitments totaling up to an additional 363 Pie Five restaurants.


                                        








"We have an accelerated rate of franchised restaurant openings in the next six months, including stores in several new markets," said Coleman.

The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating operating performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as an alternative or substitute for its financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, pre-opening expense, gain/loss on sale of assets, costs related to impairment, other lease charges, non-operating store costs and discontinued operations.  A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income is included with the accompanying financial statements.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Reports First Fiscal Quarter Financial Results, issued 09-Nov-2016 by RAVE Restaurant Group, Inc. over PR Newswire, we are advised by the company that the non-GAAP Financial Reconciliation Table - the final table in the release - was inadvertently omitted. The complete, corrected release follows:RAVE Restaurant Group, Inc. Reports First Fiscal Quarter Financial ResultsPie Five Pizza Co. expands while Pizza Inn shows positive comparable store growth<!--Begin actual release body-->DALLAS, Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- RAVE Restaurant Group, Inc. (RAVE) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 ended September 25, 2016.First Quarter Highlights:Total consolidated revenue increased 6.3% to $15.5 million compared to $14.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Pie Five comparable store retail sales decreased 14.7% from the same period of the prior year.Pie Five system-wide retail sales increased 35.5%, while average weekly sales declined 12.8%, year over year.Pizza Inn domestic comparable store retail sales increased 0.2% from the same period of the prior year, while total domestic retail sales decreased by 1.6%.Net loss of $1.5 million was $0.9 million greater than the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to closed store expenses, lease termination costs and lower sales and financial performance by Company-owned Pie Five stores.On a fully diluted basis, the loss was $0.14 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to a loss of $0.05 per share for the same period of the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA of ($0.2) million was $0.4 million less than the same quarter of the prior year.Company-owned Pie Five operating cash flow decreased $0.6 million from the same period of the prior year.Net addition of four Pie Five restaurants during the quarter brought the total Pie Five restaurants open at the end of the quarter to 92."Sales trends continued to be very challenging in the first fiscal quarter for the Pie Five system while sales in the Pizza Inn system were comparatively stable, and these trends have continued so far in the current quarter," said Clinton Coleman, Interim Chief Executive Officer for Rave Restaurant Group, Inc.  "We are implementing several new service, product, and marketing initiatives to address these poor traffic trends at Pie Five, including the recent launch of online ordering."First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Operating ResultsTotal revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and the comparable prior year quarter were $15.5 million and $14.5 million, respectively, an increase of 6.3% year over year.  Additional franchise development fees previously received from Pie Five franchisees have been deferred and will be recognized as future restaurants are opened.  Pizza Inn domestic comparable store retail sales increased 0.2% from the same period in the prior year. For Pie Five, system-wide retail sales increased 35.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 when compared to the same period in the prior year driven by a 57.9% increase in average units open, while system-wide average weekly sales decreased by 12.8%, year over year.  Comparable store retail sales decreased by 14.7% for the most recent fiscal quarter compared to the same period in the prior year.  The Pie Five comparable store retail sales were adversely impacted by restaurants recently entering the comparable store base having lower average sales than in prior years.   The Company believes that increased competition within the fast-casual segment and general industry softness contributed to weakened trends within the Pie Five system. "At Pie Five we are focused on making it faster and more convenient for our customers to get a consistently great personalized pizza," said Coleman. "Meanwhile, I'm pleased that Pizza Inn is performing relatively well in a tough dine-in restaurant environment, and the performance of recent new and remodeled franchised restaurants indicates a potential for establishing a sustainable growth path for the brand."Development ReviewIn the first quarter of fiscal 2017, six new franchised Pie Five restaurants were opened, while one franchised and one Company restaurants were closed, bringing the fiscal quarter-end total unit count to 92 restaurants.  The Company signed two new franchise development agreements with an existing franchisee for up to 16 additional Pie Five restaurants in Louisiana and Nevada.  The Company currently has franchise restaurant development commitments totaling up to an additional 363 Pie Five restaurants."We have an accelerated rate of franchised restaurant openings in the next six months, including stores in several new markets," said Coleman.Conference CallA conference call and audio webcast has been scheduled for 5:00 p.m. Central time today to discuss these results.
