About Us






	CARRIZO OIL & GAS, INC. IS A HOUSTON-BASED ENERGY COMPANY ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT, AND PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS FROM RESOURCE PLAYS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES.

	Our current operations are principally focused in proven, producing oil and gas shales primarily in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, the Delaware Basin in West Texas, the Niobrara Formation in Colorado, the Utica Shale in Ohio, and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania.

	We have grown our production and reserves over the last 10+ years by focusing on horizontal drilling and completion in unconventional resource plays. We are an industry leader in horizontal development drilling, having drilled and completed more than 800 horizontal wells across multiple resource plays. The highly predictable nature of our drilling inventory provides us with a great deal of precision, as we can quickly and effectively adjust our activity in response to changes in commodity prices.

	The company has accumulated significant expertise in the drilling and completion of complex extended reach horizontal wells in shale plays, from densely populated urban areas to difficult terrains. Our business strategy is to leverage this core competency in pursuing exploitation and development opportunities in the most prospective North American resource shale regions. This strategy has led to significant success the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas where we are one of the lowest cost, fastest growing operators.

	In April of 2010 we announced the initiation of oil focused horizontal development programs in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas where we have accumulated ~101,600 net acres and in the Niobrara Formation in Northeastern Colorado where we have accumulated ~31,300 net acres. We have experienced impressive results in both these areas with 100% drilling success and strong production growth. More recently, we have built a position in the emerging Utica Shale in Eastern Ohio, where we hold ~25,900 net acres, as well as the Wolfcamp Shale in the West Texas Delaware Basin, where we hold ~23,500 net acres. We also maintain an option on natural gas prices through our position in the Marcellus Shale in Appalachia, where we have accumulated ~17,700 net acres.

	In 2016, we spent $432 million on oil and gas operations and have budgeted $560 million for 2017 activities.

Delaware Basin



Eagle Ford Shale



Marcellus Shale



Niobrara Formation



Utica Shale









Delaware Basin







	The Delaware Basin, located on the western flank of the Greater Permian Basin, is separated from the Midland Basin by the Central Basin Platform and extends from southwestern New Mexico into western Texas.  The Delaware Basin contains multiple Permian-aged zones that have the potential for oil and gas development. Historically, production was focused on the vertical development of the commingled “Wolfbone” formation.  However, industry activity has now shifted to horizontal development of the various formations.  Carrizo’s focus is the Wolfcamp formation, which is characterized by interbedded shale and limestone; future development is expected to target the oilier Upper Wolfcamp formation. Carrizo’s land position is primarily located in eastern Culberson County and Reeves County.
View Contact Information






Eagle Ford Shale




	The Eagle Ford Shale trend extends from the Texas border with Mexico, past San Antonio, east toward Houston. The eastern economic limit of the play has yet to be established. Reserves associated with the Eagle Ford vary from dry gas in the deeper southernmost portion of the play, in a trend from Webb to DeWitt County, to black oil with little associated gas at its northern limits along a trend from Zavala to Fayette County. Carrizo elected to restrict its land acquisitions to the central portion of the trend with the intent to develop reserves consisting of light oil and condensate with a moderate amount of associated rich natural gas. Carrizo's mineral leases and leasing activities are located primarily in La Salle County with smaller positions in Dimmit, Atascosa, Frio, and McMullen Counties.
View Contact Information









Marcellus Shale







	The Marcellus Shale stretches from New York to Eastern Ohio and West Virginia as part of the Appalachian Basin, and is one of the most active natural gas plays in the country. Marcellus outcrops can be seen in central New York, and the formation dips southerly until it reaches nearly 8,000 feet below the surface in Central Pennsylvania. The formation is a Devonian age Black Shale separated into Upper and Lower units by the Cherry Valley Limestone. Carrizo’s development has been targeting the more organic-rich lower unit of the Marcellus. Carrizo’s land position is located in Northeastern and Central Pennsylvania, as well as West Virginia.
View Contact Information






Niobrara Formation




	The sediments described as the Niobrara Formation were deposited in the deeper portion of the Western Interior Seaway during the late Cretaceous period. Extending from Canada into New Mexico, the Niobrara is represented in northeastern Colorado by a calcareous shale with high-in-place organic content similar to Texas' Austin Chalk. This brittle marl is highly fractured in some areas and has been a prolific producer of oil when this fractured reservoir has been developed using horizontal drilling technology. Carrizo's land position is concentrated in Weld and Morgan Counties where Niobrara wells produce oil with little associated gas.
View Contact Information









Utica Shale







	The Utica Shale underlies much of the Appalachian region of the northeastern United States, stretching from New York to Ohio, and encompasses an even larger area than the Marcellus Shale. The Utica is Ordovician in age and underlies the Marcellus in the region. The target zone within the formation is the organic-rich Point Pleasant, which is the lower part of the Utica formation. Carrizo has chosen to focus its leasing and drilling activities on the southern portion of the Utica Shale, primarily in Guernsey and northern Noble Counties, Ohio, which is believed to be prospective for liquid-rich gas and condensate.
