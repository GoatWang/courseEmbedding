            COMMENTEMAILMOREFedEx Corp.’s chief legal officer is retiring Sept. 30.The company on Thursday announced the retirement of Christine P. Richards, executive vice president, general counsel and secretary. Her successor will be named later.Richards, 62, a FedEx employee since 1984, has led legal, regulatory, governmental affairs and security groups since 2005.She's on the $60 billion company's five-member executive committee as well as the strategic management committee.Richards and FedEx on Wednesday entered into an agreement that includes a one-year non-compete covenant and a one-time, $753,900 payment to Richards after her retirement, according to a FedEx filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission."Christine Richards has provided bold and innovative leadership in successfully addressing a wide variety of critical legal, regulatory and security challenges and opportunities for FedEx,” Frederick W. Smith, FedEx Corp. chairman and chief executive officer, said in a news release."Her untiring work ethic and in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of the business have made her service as a counselor and business partner invaluable,” Smith said.Richards will become the second member of Smith's inner circle to retire within a year. Michael Glenn, executive vice president, market development and corporate communications, retired at the end of 2016.Richards is responsible for ensuring that FedEx and its subsidiaries' global activities are in compliance with international, federal, state, and local government regulations, her corporate bio says.The release credited Richards with leading “ the aggressive legal strategies that protected the FedEx brand from misguided government investigations and legislative threats. She also led multiple successful business negotiations and acquisitions, including most recently the completion of the acquisition of TNT.”She was corporate vice president, customer and business transactions, before her current position.Richards serves on boards of Dixon Gallery and Gardens, the Fuqua School of Business at Duke and the State Collaborative on Reforming Education.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
