PRIVACY POLICY

Introduction We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important to you. The purpose of this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) is to let you know how we handle the information we receive from you through this website (the “Site”). This Policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this Policy, terms such as “we” or “our” and “the Company” refer to EdLogics LLC, a Virginia limited liability company (“EdLogics”) and terms such as “you,” “your” and “users” refer to users of the Site. This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the federal laws of the United States, and the Company makes no representation that use of the Site is appropriate or available in locations outside of the United States. Cookies and Non-Personal Information “Non-personal information” means information that does not permit us to specifically identify you by your full name or similar unique identifying information such as a social security number, member identification number, address or telephone number. The Company uses various technologies, which may include “cookie” technology, to gather non-personal information from Site users, such as which pages are used and how often they are used. “Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may include “single-session cookies” which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and “persistent” cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire. From time to time, we may also engage one or more third party service providers who assign cookies to conduct Site tracking for us. These service providers use cookies solely to provide us with aggregate data about traffic on the Site. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you have the ability to change your browser to prevent cookies from downloading or to notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Even without accepting cookies, you can still access some of the features on the Site. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some the Site’s essential benefits, however, we recommend that you leave cookies turned on. We may also collect other forms of non-personal information such as what web browsers are used to read the Site. Aggregate and de-identified data regarding Site users and their participation in the Site is also considered non-personal information. We may use and disclose non-personal information unless restricted by this Policy or by law. Some examples of the ways we use non-personal information include:  Customizing your experience on the Site, including managing and recording your preferences. Product development, research and promotional purposes. Tracking resources and data accessed on the Site. Developing reports regarding Site usage, activity, outcomes and other statistics. Assisting users experiencing problems with the Site. Enabling certain functions and tools on the Site. Tracking paths of users within the Site.  Your Personal Information “Personal information” means information that specifically identifies you as an individual, such as your full name, telephone number, e-mail address or postal address. If you choose to participate in the Site, you may also disclose certain health and health-related information to us for purpose of your participation in Site programs. Any health information you disclose to us that is linked with an identifier, such as your name, is part of your personal information. The Site may include web pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. You do not have to provide us with personal information if you do not want to. We may ask that you provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis in certain areas of the Site. We may use personal information for a number of purposes, such as:  To personalize the Site for you To administer surveys and promotions To enable our Rewards program fulfillment vendor and other third parties that we hire to perform services on our behalf to perform such services To provide you with information that we believe may be useful to you, such as information about products or services provided by us or other businesses To perform analytics and to improve our products and services To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal process To protect someone’s health, safety, or welfare To protect our rights, the rights of affiliates or related third parties, or to take appropriate legal action, such as to enforce our Terms of Use To keep a record of our transactions and communications As otherwise necessary or useful for us to conduct our business, so long as such use is permitted by law  We may use personal information to contact you through any contact information you provide through the Site, including any email address, telephone number, cell phone number, text message number, or fax number. Please see the section below titled “Our Online Communications Practices. We may share personal information within the Company, and we may combine personal information that you provide us through the Site with other information we have received from you, whether online or offline, or from other sources such as our business partners or your sponsoring organization. The Site may offer the opportunity for you to sign up to receive email messages, newsletters or other communications from the Site in connection with one or more features or programs within the Site. In order for you to sign up for these communications, we may ask for contact information, such as name, mailing address and email address. We may also offer you the opportunity to sign up to receive email messages or mailings from companies with which the Company is affiliated or does business that we think may be of interest to you. If you decide to sign up for these communications, we may ask for your contact information for that purpose. Sharing Personal Information We will only share your personal information with third parties as outlined in this Policy and as otherwise permitted by law. We may share personal information if all or part of the Company is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction. We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting activities that are illegal, violate our rules, or may be harmful to other users. We also may share personal information if we in good faith believe that doing so is necessary to protect and defend our legal rights and property, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site by other parties, or to protect the personal safety or property of users of the Site or the general public. WE MAY NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE PRIOR TO DISCLOSURE IN SUCH CASES. If your sponsoring organization (your “Sponsor”) requires reports about you and your participation in the Site as a specific condition of its agreement with the Company, or if we enter into collaborative efforts with your Sponsor to validate the efficacy or results of one or more programs in the Site, we will share personal information about you with your Sponsor. We encourage you to review with your Sponsor whether or not your Sponsor requires specific reports from the Company that include the sharing of personal information about you as a condition of your Sponsor’s agreement with the Company. EdLogics reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to use personal information you may provide in your participation in the Site to document positive health and wellness outcomes and to validate that engagement by users of the Site is correlated with better health improvements. The results of those studies and analyses may be shared by EdLogics with third parties. Except in those instances described in the preceding paragraph relating to reporting requirements or collaborations with your Sponsor, however, the personal information we use for such purposes will consist of aggregate or de-identified data. We may share personal information with other companies that we hire to perform services on our behalf or collaborate with. For example, we may hire a company to help us send and manage e-mail, and we might provide such company with your e-mail address and certain other information in order for them to send you an e-mail message on our behalf. We may also hire companies to host or operate parts of our website and related computers and software applications and hire companies to fulfill portions of our Rewards program and we might provide such companies with personal information necessary for the to perform their services. We use personal information for administration of the Site, for communications with you, and for operating the interactive elements of the Site. In addition, we may from time to time contract with third party service providers to assist us in maintaining and managing our information on users of the Site. In such instances, we advise these service providers to use the personal information needed to perform their functions, but not to retain, store, share, or use personal information for any secondary purposes. Some of the Company’s affiliated businesses and service providers may be located outside of the United States and personal information may be collected, used, stored or processed outside of the United States for the purposes described in this Policy. Reviewing Your Information Portions of the Site permit you to submit personal information and to answer questions about yourself for purposes of compiling your profile, obtaining assessments, and participating in Site programs and features. You may review some of this information and make corrections or updates at any time by following instructions within the Site. You have certain rights to know about the personal information that the Company collects and maintains about you through the Site, including the right to correct or update the information that the Company has on record if any such information is incorrect, incomplete or out of date. No Transfer of Personal Information for Direct Marketing The Company will not sell, rent, transfer, disclose or otherwise permit the use of your personal information by advertisers or other third parties for direct marketing purposes. From time to time, the Company may itself send you information about opportunities, products or services provided by us or other businesses or similar promotional information. Our Right to Verify Information As a user of the Site, you may participate in activities to earn EdLogics Points and to receive Rewards and other benefits, which participation may require your reporting of certain information to us such as whether you have completed a step or activity or satisfied a program requirement. We reserve the right to confirm or verify the accuracy of any such information by contacting third parties. The third parties we contact for verification may include your Sponsor. Site and Information Security We use a number of methods of physical security (such as locks and alarm systems), electronic security (such as passwords and encryption methods), and procedural security (such as rules regarding the handling and use of information), designed to protect the security and integrity of information submitted through the Site. Due to the nature of the Internet and online communications, however, we can not guarantee that any information transmitted online will remain absolutely confidential, and we are not liable for the illegal acts of third parties such as criminal hackers. Maintaining the security of information transmitted to us or by us through the Site is of utmost concern to the Company. However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. For that reason, to protect your privacy, we ask that you do not use email messages to communicate information to us that you consider sensitive or confidential. The Company strives to protect the privacy of your personal information, but we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us electronically through the Site. When we receive an email transmission from you, we will use reasonable efforts to maintain the security of such information within our internal data systems. Depending on the nature of your inquiry or message, upon completion of the exchange with you, your message may be archived in our records or it may be deleted and discarded. If you have any concerns about the security of confidential or sensitive information, however, do not send such information to us by email or by telephone. We do not recommend that any health information or other confidential information be sent to us by email or telephone. You must be registered to use the Site. The registration process for the Site may require a customer identifier from your Sponsor. Once you are registered, you will use a unique user ID and password to enter the Site. Your password may not accessible by the Company. For your security, it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer.

We may also send e-mail communications regarding Site updates and information on general health, lifestyle, fitness and wellness topics. We will offer you appropriate consent mechanisms, such as opt-out, with respect to most of these online communications from us. External Links on the Site The Site may provide links to various Internet websites that the Company does not control. When you click on one of these links, you will be automatically transferred away from the Site and connected to the linked website of the organization or company selected. We do conduct investigations of linked websites and attempt to monitor them for content, quality and accuracy. We do not express approval or endorsement of any product or services offered on or made available through such websites. In some cases, the Company may have an affiliation or business relationship with the operation of a linked website. Each website linked to the Site maintains its own independent data collection procedure and privacy policy. The Company expects that all affiliated and unaffiliated third parties with which it has a business relationship, including the operators of linked websites, to respect the privacy of our users, but we are not responsible for the actions of such third parties.

Alternatively, California law provides that if the Company has a written privacy policy that gives users of the Site the choice of either an opt-out or an opt-in decision for use of personal information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the Company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. The Company has not elected the alternative option and does not provide users of the Site the choice of an opt-out or opt-in decision for use of personal information by third parties for marketing purposes. If you are a California resident an request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request to us at help@edlogics.com with a statement of your preference on how you wish to receive our response to your request.

Cookies and Non-Personal Information “Non-personal information” means information that does not permit us to specifically identify you by your full name or similar unique identifying information such as a social security number, member identification number, address or telephone number. The Company uses various technologies, which may include “cookie” technology, to gather non-personal information from Site users, such as which pages are used and how often they are used. “Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may include “single-session cookies” which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and “persistent” cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire. From time to time, we may also engage one or more third party service providers who assign cookies to conduct Site tracking for us. These service providers use cookies solely to provide us with aggregate data about traffic on the Site. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you have the ability to change your browser to prevent cookies from downloading or to notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Even without accepting cookies, you can still access some of the features on the Site. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some the Site’s essential benefits, however, we recommend that you leave cookies turned on. We may also collect other forms of non-personal information such as what web browsers are used to read the Site. Aggregate and de-identified data regarding Site users and their participation in the Site is also considered non-personal information. We may use and disclose non-personal information unless restricted by this Policy or by law. Some examples of the ways we use non-personal information include:  Customizing your experience on the Site, including managing and recording your preferences. Product development, research and promotional purposes. Tracking resources and data accessed on the Site. Developing reports regarding Site usage, activity, outcomes and other statistics. Assisting users experiencing problems with the Site. Enabling certain functions and tools on the Site. Tracking paths of users within the Site.

Any health information you disclose to us that is linked with an identifier, such as your name, is part of your personal information. The Site may include web pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. You do not have to provide us with personal information if you do not want to. We may ask that you provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis in certain areas of the Site. We may use personal information for a number of purposes, such as:  To personalize the Site for you To administer surveys and promotions To enable our Rewards program fulfillment vendor and other third parties that we hire to perform services on our behalf to perform such services To provide you with information that we believe may be useful to you, such as information about products or services provided by us or other businesses To perform analytics and to improve our products and services To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal process To protect someone’s health, safety, or welfare To protect our rights, the rights of affiliates or related third parties, or to take appropriate legal action, such as to enforce our Terms of Use To keep a record of our transactions and communications As otherwise necessary or useful for us to conduct our business, so long as such use is permitted by law  We may use personal information to contact you through any contact information you provide through the Site, including any email address, telephone number, cell phone number, text message number, or fax number.

The Site may offer the opportunity for you to sign up to receive email messages, newsletters or other communications from the Site in connection with one or more features or programs within the Site. In order for you to sign up for these communications, we may ask for contact information, such as name, mailing address and email address. We may also offer you the opportunity to sign up to receive email messages or mailings from companies with which the Company is affiliated or does business that we think may be of interest to you. If you decide to sign up for these communications, we may ask for your contact information for that purpose. Sharing Personal Information We will only share your personal information with third parties as outlined in this Policy and as otherwise permitted by law. We may share personal information if all or part of the Company is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction. We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting activities that are illegal, violate our rules, or may be harmful to other users. We also may share personal information if we in good faith believe that doing so is necessary to protect and defend our legal rights and property, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site by other parties, or to protect the personal safety or property of users of the Site or the general public. WE MAY NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE PRIOR TO DISCLOSURE IN SUCH CASES. If your sponsoring organization (your “Sponsor”) requires reports about you and your participation in the Site as a specific condition of its agreement with the Company, or if we enter into collaborative efforts with your Sponsor to validate the efficacy or results of one or more programs in the Site, we will share personal information about you with your Sponsor. We encourage you to review with your Sponsor whether or not your Sponsor requires specific reports from the Company that include the sharing of personal information about you as a condition of your Sponsor’s agreement with the Company. EdLogics reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to use personal information you may provide in your participation in the Site to document positive health and wellness outcomes and to validate that engagement by users of the Site is correlated with better health improvements. The results of those studies and analyses may be shared by EdLogics with third parties. Except in those instances described in the preceding paragraph relating to reporting requirements or collaborations with your Sponsor, however, the personal information we use for such purposes will consist of aggregate or de-identified data. We may share personal information with other companies that we hire to perform services on our behalf or collaborate with. For example, we may hire a company to help us send and manage e-mail, and we might provide such company with your e-mail address and certain other information in order for them to send you an e-mail message on our behalf. We may also hire companies to host or operate parts of our website and related computers and software applications and hire companies to fulfill portions of our Rewards program and we might provide such companies with personal information necessary for the to perform their services. We use personal information for administration of the Site, for communications with you, and for operating the interactive elements of the Site. In addition, we may from time to time contract with third party service providers to assist us in maintaining and managing our information on users of the Site. In such instances, we advise these service providers to use the personal information needed to perform their functions, but not to retain, store, share, or use personal information for any secondary purposes. Some of the Company’s affiliated businesses and service providers may be located outside of the United States and personal information may be collected, used, stored or processed outside of the United States for the purposes described in this Policy.

No Transfer of Personal Information for Direct Marketing The Company will not sell, rent, transfer, disclose or otherwise permit the use of your personal information by advertisers or other third parties for direct marketing purposes.

We reserve the right to confirm or verify the accuracy of any such information by contacting third parties. The third parties we contact for verification may include your Sponsor. Site and Information Security We use a number of methods of physical security (such as locks and alarm systems), electronic security (such as passwords and encryption methods), and procedural security (such as rules regarding the handling and use of information), designed to protect the security and integrity of information submitted through the Site. Due to the nature of the Internet and online communications, however, we can not guarantee that any information transmitted online will remain absolutely confidential, and we are not liable for the illegal acts of third parties such as criminal hackers. Maintaining the security of information transmitted to us or by us through the Site is of utmost concern to the Company. However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. For that reason, to protect your privacy, we ask that you do not use email messages to communicate information to us that you consider sensitive or confidential. The Company strives to protect the privacy of your personal information, but we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us electronically through the Site.

Depending on the nature of your inquiry or message, upon completion of the exchange with you, your message may be archived in our records or it may be deleted and discarded. If you have any concerns about the security of confidential or sensitive information, however, do not send such information to us by email or by telephone. We do not recommend that any health information or other confidential information be sent to us by email or telephone. You must be registered to use the Site.
