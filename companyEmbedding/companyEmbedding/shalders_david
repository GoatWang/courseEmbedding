Early life[edit]

Shalders entered the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay as a 16 year old cadet midshipman in 1967. After sea training he undertook Operations and Weapons courses in the United Kingdom. On returning to Australia, he was posted as Executive Officer of the patrol boat HMAS Ardent, then joined HMAS Vendetta, before he assumed command of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force patrol boat Samarai.
He then served as Divisional Officer at the RAN College in 1976, and then in HMAS Perth prior to Principal Warfare Officer training in the UK in 1978. He returned as Operations and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Officer aboard HMAS Vendetta, then was an officer's posting officer in Canberra.
After promotion to lieutenant commander in 1981, he completed the Naval Staff Course for International Officers at the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island and then undertook Advanced Warfare Officer training in the UK, specialising in anti-submarine warfare. He joined HMAS Hobart as ASW Officer and Operations Officer in 1982, but completed this posting as Executive Officer.

Early life[edit]
Shalders was born in Ararat, Victoria, on 28 September 1951 to Kenneth George Shalders, a former army lieutenant who had served with the 2/12th Battalion in the Second World War, and Muriel Jean Shalders.[1][2]
Naval career[edit]
Shalders entered the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay as a 16 year old cadet midshipman in 1967. After sea training he undertook Operations and Weapons courses in the United Kingdom. On returning to Australia, he was posted as Executive Officer of the patrol boat HMAS Ardent, then joined HMAS Vendetta, before he assumed command of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force patrol boat Samarai.
He then served as Divisional Officer at the RAN College in 1976, and then in HMAS Perth prior to Principal Warfare Officer training in the UK in 1978. He returned as Operations and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Officer aboard HMAS Vendetta, then was an officer's posting officer in Canberra.
After promotion to lieutenant commander in 1981, he completed the Naval Staff Course for International Officers at the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island and then undertook Advanced Warfare Officer training in the UK, specialising in anti-submarine warfare. He joined HMAS Hobart as ASW Officer and Operations Officer in 1982, but completed this posting as Executive Officer.
In the rank of commander, he then served at the RAN Staff College as a member of the Directing Staff from mid-1984. After two years at the embassy in Washington, D.C. in 1986–87, he assumed command of HMAS Sydney and was then appointed as Commander, Sea Training.




Russ Shalders, then Chief of Navy, is greeted by Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd at the 2008 National Anzac Day service, Australian War Memorial, Canberra.


On promotion to captain, he was posted at short notice to command HMAS Darwin during the Persian Gulf War, and was awarded the Conspicuous Service Cross[3] in recognition of this period in command. In 1991, he became Director of Naval Warfare and subsequently Director General Naval Policy and Warfare. Shalders commanded HMAS Perth in 1993–94 and attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in London in 1995.
On promotion to commodore, he was appointed as Director General Joint Exercise Plans and then Director General Operations Policy and Doctrine and Director General Information Strategic Concepts. He returned to the Fleet to become Commodore Flotillas in January 1998, responsible for the operational efficiency of all fleet units.
On promotion to rear admiral in July 1999, he was seconded to the Australian Customs Service as the inaugural Director General Coastwatch. He was appointed as Head, Defence Personnel Executive in 2001.
Shalders was promoted to vice admiral and appointed as Vice Chief of the Defence Force in July 2002. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours list of 2003.[4]
On 23 May 2005, the Minister for Defence announced that Shalders would succeed Vice Admiral Chris Ritchie as Chief of Navy from July 2005 for a three-year term. He retired from this position, and the Navy, on 4 July 2008.

In his spare time, Shalders enjoys golf, jogging and gardening.
Shalders' brother, Commodore Richard Shalders, was Commander Australian Navy Submarine Group (CANSG)[5][6] until his retirement in July 2008.

Board - Europe


– UK, London – Tullett Prebon plc announces the appointment of David Shalders as an independent non-executive director, with effect from 27 February 2014. He will also be a member of the Remuneration Committee.

David Shalders is Group Operations & Technology Director at Willis Group Holdings plc, responsible for information technology, operations, real estate and change management functions. Having just joined Willis in November 2013, David will spend four months in his new role before taking on the additional commitment of joining the Tullett Prebon plc Board.
David Shalders joined Willis from the Royal Bank of Scotland Group where he served for over a decade in senior operations and IT roles, most recently as Global Chief Operating Officer for Global Banking and Markets. He also led the division’s regulatory response to Basel 3. Prior to that, David led the Group’s integration with ABN Amro and held roles as Head of London and Asia Operations and Head of Derivative Operations for NatWest.
Rupert Robson, Chairman, commented: “I am delighted that David has agreed to join the Board. Tullett Prebon continues to experience rapid change in its regulatory environment and to make material investments in the development, launch and continuing running costs of new electronic platforms and associated technology infrastructure. David’s background in these and other areas of our business will enable him to make a valuable contribution to the Board.”
