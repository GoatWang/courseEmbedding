Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview
The Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the MSCI US REIT Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objective.
These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

and any other Indebtedness incurred by QCP or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries since the first day of such Four Quarter Period and

other Indebtedness, had occurred on the first day of such period;

removal from service and any related repayment or retirement of
Indebtedness had occurred as of the first day of such period, with
the appropriate adjustments with respect to such acquisition,

included in such pro forma calculation.  If the Indebtedness
giving rise to the need to make the calculation described above or
any other Indebtedness incurred after the first day of the relevant
Four Quarter Period bears interest at a floating rate, then, for
purposes of calculating interest expense, the interest rate on such
Indebtedness will be computed on a pro forma basis by applying the
average daily rate which would have been in effect during the
entire Four Quarter Period.  For purposes of the
foregoing, Indebtedness will be deemed to be incurred by QCP
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries whenever QCP or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries shall create, assume, guarantee or
otherwise become liable in respect thereof.

Issuer.
 

(iii)       No L/C
Issuer shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit
if:
 

(A)       any
order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such
L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law
applicable to such L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether
or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority
with jurisdiction over such L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request

Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the
Closing Date, or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer any unreimbursed
loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date
and which such L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it (for
which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated
hereunder);
 

(B)       the
issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more
policies of such L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit

or
 

(G)       any

unless such L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the
delivery of Cash Collateral, reasonably satisfactory to such L/C
Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrowers or such
Defaulting Lender to eliminate such L/C Issuer’s actual or
potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to
 
-53- 





 

Section 2.18(a)(iv) ) with respect to such Defaulting Lender arising
from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or such
Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which such L/C
Issuer has Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole
discretion.

 

(iv)       No L/C
Issuer shall amend any Letter of Credit if such L/C Issuer would
not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its
amended form under the terms hereof.
 

(v)       No L/C
Issuer shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit
if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time
to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms
hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does
not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of
Credit.
 

(vi)       Each
L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving Lenders with
respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents

Article IX included the L/C Issuers with respect to
such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided
herein with respect to the L/C Issuers.
 

(b)       
Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit;
Auto-Extension Letters of Credit .
 

(i)        
Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may
be, upon the request of the Borrowers delivered to an L/C Issuer
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter
of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a
Responsible Officer.  Such Letter of Credit Application must
be received by the applicable L/C Issuer and the Administrative
Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least three
(3) Business Days (or such shorter period as the
Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer may agree in a particular
instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance
date or date of amendment, as the case may be.  In the case of
a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such
Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail
reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer: 
(A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of
Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and
currency thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the
name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents
to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be
presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder;
(G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit
and (H) such other matters as the applicable L/C Issuer may
reasonably require.  In the case of a request for an amendment
of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably
satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer:  (A) the
Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of
amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the
nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters
as the applicable L/C Issuer may reasonably require. 
Additionally, the Borrowers shall furnish to the applicable L/C
Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and
information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance
or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as such L/C Issuer or
the Administrative Agent may reasonably require.
 

(ii)       
Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the
applicable L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent in
writing that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such
Letter of Credit Application from the Borrowers and, if not, such
L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy
thereof. Unless an L/C Issuer has received written notice from any
Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Borrowers, at
least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of
issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one
or more applicable conditions
 
-54- 





 
contained in Article IV shall not
then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, such L/C Issuer shall (and shall not, if it has received
such a notice), on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for
the account of a Borrower or other Credit Party (or the applicable
Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may
be, in each case in accordance with such L/C Issuer’s usual
and customary business practices.  Immediately upon the
issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Lender shall be
deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to,
purchase from the applicable L/C Issuer a risk participation in
such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such
Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Aggregate
Revolving Commitments times the amount of such Letter of
Credit.
 

(iii)       If the
Borrowers so request in any applicable Letter of Credit
Application, the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion,
agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension
provisions (each, an “ Auto-Extension Letter of Credit
”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of
Credit must permit such L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at
least once in each twelve (12) month period (commencing with the
date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice
to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “
Non-Extension Notice Date ”) in each such twelve (12)
month period to be agreed upon by the Borrowers and such L/C Issuer
at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.  Unless otherwise
directed by an L/C Issuer, the Borrowers shall not be required to
make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such
extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been
issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized
(but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the
extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date
not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date (except as set
forth in Section 2.03(a)(ii)(B) ); provided ,
however , that no L/C Issuer shall permit any such extension
if (A) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be
permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such
Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms
hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or
(iii) of Section 2.03(a)  or otherwise), or
(B) it has received notice in writing on or before the day
that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Extension
Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the
Required Revolving Lenders have elected not to permit such
extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving
Lender or the Borrowers that one or more of the applicable
conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then
satisfied, and in each such case directing such L/C Issuer not to
permit such extension.
 

(iv)      
Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any
amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect
thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable L/C Issuer
will also deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent a
true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or
amendment.
 

(v)       Upon
examination and determination of compliance with Letter of Credit
terms and conditions of documents presented by the beneficiary for
payment under any Letter of Credit (which examination and
determination shall not be unreasonably delayed), the applicable
L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent thereof (such notification provided by the L/C
Issuer to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent being referred
to herein as an “ L/C Draw Notice ”).  If
an L/C Draw Notice with respect to a Letter of Credit is received
by the Borrowers on or prior to 11:00 a.m. on the date of
any payment by an L/C Issuer (such date, an “ Honor
Date ”), then, not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Honor
Date, the Borrowers shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through the
Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such
drawing or (y) after 11:00 a.m. or the Applicable
Time, as the case may be, on the Honor Date, then, not later than
11:00 a.m. on the first Business Day following the Honor Date,
the Borrowers shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the
Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such
drawing (such date on which the Borrowers, pursuant to clauses
(x) and (y) of this sentence, are required to reimburse
the L/C Issuer for a drawing under a Letter of Credit is referred
to herein as the “ L/C Reimbursement Date ”);
provided , however , that if the L/C Reimbursement
Date for a drawing under a Letter of Credit is the Business Day
following the Honor Date pursuant to clause (y) of
 
-55- 





 
this sentence, the Unreimbursed Amount shall
accrue interest from and including the Honor Date until such time
as the L/C Issuer is reimbursed in full therefor (whether through
payment by the Borrowers and/or through a Committed Revolving Loan
or L/C Borrowing made in accordance with
Section 2.03(b)(vi)  or (vii) ) at a rate
equal to (A) for the period from and including the Honor Date
to but excluding the first Business Day to occur thereafter, the
rate of interest then applicable to a Revolving Credit Loan that is
a Base Rate Loan and (B) thereafter, at the Default Rate
applicable to a Revolving Credit Loan that is a Base Rate
Loan.  Interest accruing on the Unreimbursed Amount pursuant
to the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence shall be
payable by the Borrowers upon demand to the Administrative Agent,
solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.  If the Borrowers
fail to so reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer within the time
frames specified in clause (x) or (y) above, as
applicable, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Dollar Tranche Lender of the Honor Date, the L/C Reimbursement Date
(if different from the Honor Date), the amount of the unreimbursed
drawing (the “ Unreimbursed Amount ”), and the
amount of such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage
thereof.  In such event, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have
requested a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans to be
disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed
Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in
Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate
Revolving Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized
portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions
set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a
Committed Loan Notice).
 

(vi)       Each
Revolving Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section 2.03(b)(v)  make funds available to the
Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash
Collateral that has been provided for such purpose) for the account
of the applicable L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent’s
Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the
Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business
Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent,
whereupon, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.03(b)(vii) , each Revolving Lender that so
makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate
Revolving Loan to the Borrowers in such amount.  The
Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the
applicable L/C Issuer and such funds shall be applied to reimburse
the L/C Issuer for the applicable draw under the applicable Letter
of Credit.
 

(vii)       With
respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by
a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans because the
conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be
satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrowers shall be deemed to
have incurred from the applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in
the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced,
which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together
with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. 
In such event, each Lender’s payment to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.03(b)(vi)  shall be deemed payment in
respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its
participation obligation under this Section 2.03
.
 

(viii)     
Until each Revolving Lender funds its Committed Revolving Loan or
L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(b)  to
reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any
Letter of Credit issued by it, interest in respect of such
Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely
for the account of such L/C Issuer.
 

(ix)       Each
Revolving Lender’s obligation to make Committed Revolving
Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for
amounts drawn under Letters of Credit issued by it, as contemplated
by this Section 2.03(b) , shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
other right which such Lender may have against such L/C Issuer, the
Borrowers, any Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or
(C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing; provided , however ,
that each Revolving Lender’s
 
-56- 





 
obligation to make Committed Revolving Loans
pursuant to this Section 2.03(b)  is subject to
the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than
delivery by the Borrowers of a Committed Loan Notice).  No
such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the
obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer
for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any
Letter of Credit issued by it, together with interest as provided
herein.
 

(x)       If any
Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer any amount
required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.03(b)  by the time
specified in Section 2.03(b)(vi) , then, without
limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such L/C Issuer
shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon
for the period from the date such payment is required to the date
on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer
at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from
time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or
similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection
with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with
interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid (excluding such
interest and fees) shall constitute such Lender’s Committed
Revolving Loan included in the relevant Committed Borrowing or L/C
Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may
be.  A certificate of the applicable L/C Issuer submitted to
any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any
amounts owing under this clause (x) shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.
 

(c)       
Repayment of Participations .
 

(i)        
At any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter
of Credit issued by it and has received from any Lender such
Lender’s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance
with Section 2.03(b) , if the Administrative Agent
receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect
of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether
directly from the Borrowers or otherwise, including proceeds of
Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the
Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable
Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest
payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
Lender’s L/C Advance was outstanding) in Dollars and in the
same funds as those received by the Administrative
Agent.
 

(ii)       
If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account
of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(v)
 is required to be returned under any of the circumstances
described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by an L/C Issuer in its discretion), each
Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on
demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the
date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such
Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate
from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders
under this clause (c)(ii) shall survive the payment in full of
the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
 

(d)       
Obligations Absolute .  The obligation of the Borrowers
to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for each drawing under each
Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall
be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:
 

(i)        
any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit,
this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;
 
-57- 





 

(ii)       
the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other
right that the Borrowers or any Subsidiary may have at any time
against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit
(or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee
may be acting), the applicable L/C Issuer or any other Person,
whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or
instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated
transaction;

 

(iii)       any
draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue
or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make
a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
 

(iv)       any
payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the
applicable L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person
purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,
assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or
other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any
transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in
connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief
Law;
 

(v)       
[reserved]; or

 

(vi)       any
other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar
to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that
might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
of, the Borrowers or any Subsidiary.
 

The Borrowers shall promptly examine
a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is
delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance
with the Borrowers’ instructions or other irregularity, the
Borrowers will promptly notify the applicable L/C Issuer.  The
Borrowers shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such
claim against the applicable L/C Issuer and its correspondents
unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
 

(e)       
Role of L/C Issuer .  Each Revolving Lender and each
Borrower agrees that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of
Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility
to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates
and documents expressly required by such Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such
document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any
such document.  None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative
Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any
correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be
liable to any Revolving Lender for (i) any action taken or
omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval
of the Revolving Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable;
(ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution,
effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or
instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer
Document.  The Borrowers hereby assume all risks of the acts
or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its
use of any Letter of Credit; provided , however ,
that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude
the Borrowers from pursuing such rights and remedies as they may
have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any
other agreement.  None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative
Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any
correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be
liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses
(i) through (v) of Section 2.03(d) ;
provided , however , that anything in such clauses to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrowers may have a claim
against an L/C Issuer, and an L/C Issuer may be liable to the
Borrowers, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as
opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the
Borrowers which the Borrowers prove were caused by such L/C
Issuer’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C
Issuer’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of
Credit
 
-58- 





 
issued by it after the presentation to it by the
beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly
complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit,
except where any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms have enjoined or
restrained, or purported to enjoin or restrain, such L/C Issuer
from making such payment, or such L/C Issuer’s payment under
any Letter of Credit issued by it without presentation to it of a
draft, certificates and/or other documents that substantially
comply with the terms and conditions of such Letter of
Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, any L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their
face to be in order, without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the
contrary, and such L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning
or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the
rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any
reason.  Any L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct
any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication message or
overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of
communicating with a beneficiary.
 

(f)       
Applicability of ISP; Limitation of Liability .  Unless
otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and the
Borrowers when a Letter of Credit is issued by any L/C Issuer, the
rules of the ISP shall apply to such Letter of Credit. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no L/C Issuer shall be responsible
to the Borrowers for, and no L/C Issuer’s rights and remedies
against the Borrowers shall be impaired by, any action or inaction
of such L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or
practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter
of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a
jurisdiction where such L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located,
the practice stated in the ISP or in the decisions, opinions,
practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking
Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade -
International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the
Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether
or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or
practice.
 

(g)       
Letter of Credit Fees .  The Borrowers shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in
accordance with its Applicable Percentage in Dollars a Letter of
Credit fee (the “ Letter of Credit Fee ”) for
each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily
amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit;
provided , however , any Letter of Credit Fees
otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with
respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender
has not provided Cash Collateral reasonably satisfactory to the
applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(iii)
 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward
adjustments, if any, in their respective Applicable Percentages
allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to
Section 2.18(a)(iv) , with the balance of such fee, if
any, retained by the Borrowers, if they have provided Cash
Collateral in respect of such Defaulting Lender’s Fronting
Exposure, or if the Borrowers have not provided Cash Collateral in
respect of such Fronting Exposure, payable to such L/C Issuer for
its own account.  For purposes of computing the daily amount
available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of
such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with
Section 1.06 .  Letter of Credit Fees shall be
(i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (ii) due
and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each
calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur
after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the expiry date of
such Letter of Credit and thereafter on demand.  If there is
any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily
amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be
computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each
period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in
effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, upon the request of the Required Revolving Lenders, while
any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue
at the Default Rate.
 
-59- 





 

(h)       
Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to
L/C Issuer .  The Borrowers shall pay directly to each L/C
Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, a fronting fee per annum
with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer,
equal to the greater of (i) the rate per annum of 0.125% of
the face amount of the Letter of Credit, in each case computed on
the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit
and (ii) $1,500 per annum.  The amount of such fronting
fees shall be determined on a quarterly basis in arrears, and due
and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each
calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur
after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the expiry date of
such Letter of Credit and thereafter on demand.  For purposes
of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any
Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be
determined in accordance with Section 1.06 .  In
addition, the Borrowers shall pay directly to the applicable L/C
Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, the customary issuance,
presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other
standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letter
of credit issued by it as from time to time in effect.  Such
customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable
on demand and are nonrefundable.

 

(i)        
Conflict with Issuer Documents .  In the event of any
conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer
Document, the terms hereof shall control.
 

(j)        
Letters of Credit Issued for Other Credit Parties or
Subsidiaries .  Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit
issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations
of, or is for the account of, another Credit Party or a Subsidiary,
the Borrowers shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable L/C
Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of
Credit.  The Borrowers hereby acknowledge that the issuance of
Letters of Credit for the account of other Credit Parties or
Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrowers, and that the
Borrowers’ business derives substantial benefits from the
businesses of such other Credit Parties or Subsidiaries.
 

(k)       
Outstanding Letters of Credit .  Each L/C Issuer shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent, for distribution to the
Revolving Lenders, an accounting of all Letters of Credit issued by
such L/C Issuer and outstanding as of the end of each fiscal
quarter of the Borrowers.

Swing Line Loans .
 

(a)       
The Swing Line .  Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees, in reliance upon
the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this
Section 2.04 , to make loans (each such loan, a “
Swing Line Loan ”) in Dollars to the Borrowers from
time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in
an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the
amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that
such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable
Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Committed Revolving Loans
and L/C Obligations of the Revolving Lender acting as Swing Line
Lender, may exceed the amount of such Revolving Lender’s
Revolving Commitment; provided , however , that after
giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Revolving
Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments,
(ii) subject to the foregoing, the aggregate Outstanding
Amount of the Committed Revolving Loans of any Revolving Lender,
plus such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of
the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such
Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding
Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Revolving
Lender’s Revolving Commitment, (iii) the Outstanding
Amount of the Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the Swing Line
Sublimit and (iv) the Borrowers shall not use the proceeds of
any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line
Loan.  The Swing Line Lender shall not be under any obligation
to make any Swing Line Loan if any Revolving Lender is at such time
a Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless the Swing Line Lender has
entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash
Collateral, reasonably satisfactory to the Swing Line Lender (in
its sole discretion) with the Borrowers or such Defaulting Lender
to eliminate the Swing Line Lender’s
 
-60- 





 
actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after
giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv) ) with respect to
such Defaulting Lender arising from either the Swing Line Loan then
proposed to be made or such Swing Line Loan and all other Swing
Line Loans as to which the Swing Line Lender has Fronting Exposure,
as it may elect in its sole discretion.  Within the foregoing
limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Borrowers may borrow under this Section 2.04 , prepay
under Section 2.06 , and reborrow under this
Section 2.04 .  Each Swing Line Loan shall be a
Base Rate Loan.  Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line
Loan, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing
Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an
amount equal to the product of such Revolving Lender’s
Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line
Loan.
 

(b)       
Borrowing Procedures .  Each Swing Line Borrowing shall
be made upon the Borrowers’ irrevocable notice to each of the
Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which shall be
given by a Swing Line Loan Notice.  Each such notice must be
received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not
later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and
shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a
minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date,
which shall be a Business Day.  Promptly after receipt by the
Swing Line Lender of any notice under this clause (b), the Swing
Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent in writing
that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line
Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the
Administrative Agent in writing of the contents thereof. 
Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice in writing from
the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender)
prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line
Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such
Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the
first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a)
, or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions
specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender
will (and will not, if it has received such notice), not later than
3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line
Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to
the Borrowers in Same Day Funds either by (1) crediting the
account of the Borrowers on the books of the Swing Line Lender with
the amount of such funds or (2) wire transfer of such funds,
in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and
reasonably acceptable to) the Swing Line Lender by the
Borrowers.
 

(c)       
Refinancing of Swing Line Loans .
 

(i)       The
Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion
may request, on behalf of the Borrowers (which hereby irrevocably
authorize the Swing Line Lender to so request on their behalf),
that each Revolving Lender make a Base Rate Committed Revolving
Loan in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender’s Applicable
Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then
outstanding.  Such request shall be made in writing (which
written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for
purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of
Section 2.02 , without regard to the minimum and
multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate
Committed Revolving Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of
the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 .  The Swing Line Lender shall
furnish the Borrowers with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan
Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative
Agent.  Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to
its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Committed
Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds
(and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available
with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan for the account of
any Revolving Lender) for the account of the Swing Line Lender at
the Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated
payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such
Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to
Section 2.04(c)(ii) , each Revolving Lender that so
makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate
Committed Revolving Loan to the Borrowers in such amount.  The
Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing
Line Lender.
 
-61- 





 

(ii)       If for
any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Base
Rate Committed Revolving Loan in accordance with
Section 2.04(c)(i) , the request for Base Rate
Committed Revolving Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set
forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line
Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk
participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving
Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i)
 shall be deemed payment in respect of such
participation.

 

(iii)       If any
Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required
to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.04(c)  by the time
specified in Section 2.04(c)(i) , the Swing Line Lender
shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting
through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with
interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is
required to the date on which such payment is immediately available
to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the
applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by
the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If
such Revolving Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as
aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s
Committed Revolving Loan included in the relevant Committed
Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan,
as the case may be.  A certificate of the Swing Line Lender
submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative
Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause
(iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 

(iv)       Each
Revolving Lender’s obligation to make Committed Revolving
Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line
Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c)  shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may
have against the Swing Line Lender, the Credit Parties, any
Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason whatsoever,
(B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or
(C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing; provided , however ,
that each Revolving Lender’s obligation to make Committed
Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c)
 is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 .  No such funding of risk
participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of
the Borrowers to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as
provided herein.
 

(d)       
Repayment of Participations .
 

(i)       At any
time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk
participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender
receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing
Line Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable
Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing
Line Lender.
 

(ii)       If any
payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal
or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by
the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in
Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each
Revolving Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Applicable
Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus
interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such
amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable
Overnight Rate.  The Administrative Agent will make such
demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.  The
obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause shall
survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination
of this Agreement.
 
-62- 





 

(e)       
Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender .  The Swing
Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrowers for
interest on the Swing Line Loans.  Until each Revolving Lender
funds its Base Rate Committed Revolving Loan or risk participation
pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such
Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of any Swing Line
Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be
solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.

 

(f)       
Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender .  The Borrowers
shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the
Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.

Prepayments .
 

(a)       
The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any
time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans in
whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that

Administrative Agent and be received by the Administrative Agent

Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of
$1,000,000 and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall
be in a minimum principal amount of $500,000 or, in each case, if
less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. 
Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such
prepayment and the Type(s) of Revolving Loans to be prepaid
and, if Eurocurrency Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest
Period(s) of such Loans.  The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and
of the amount of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such
prepayment.  If such notice is given by the Borrowers, the
Borrowers shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
specified therein; provided , however , that a notice
of voluntary prepayment may state that such notice is conditioned
upon an event, such as the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of Equity
Interests or other Indebtedness or the receipt of the proceeds from
a Disposition, in which case such notice of prepayment may be
revoked by the Borrowers if such condition is not satisfied. 
Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be accompanied by
all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any
additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05

Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable
Percentages of the Committed Revolving Loans.
 

(b)       
The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to
time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part
without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such
notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of
the prepayment, and (ii) any such prepayment shall be in a
minimum principal amount of $100,000, or, if less, the entire
principal amount thereof then outstanding.  Each such notice
shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment.  The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Swing Line Lender of
the amount of such Swing Line Lender’s Applicable
Percentage.  If such notice is given by the Borrowers, the
Borrowers shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
specified therein; provided , however , that a notice
of voluntary prepayment may state that such notice is conditioned
upon an event, such as the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of Equity
Interests or other Indebtedness or the receipt of the proceeds from
a Disposition, in which case such notice of prepayment may be
revoked by the Borrowers if such condition is not
satisfied.
 

(c)       
[Reserved].

(d)        If
the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers at any time that
(i) the Total Revolving Outstandings at such time exceed the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments then in effect, (ii) the L/C
Obligations at such time exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit then
in effect or (iii) the Swing Line Loans outstanding at such
time exceed the Swing Line Sublimit then in effect, the Borrowers
shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day)
prepay the applicable Revolving Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the
L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess;
provided , however , that, subject to the provisions
of Section 2.17(a)(iv) , the Borrowers shall not be
required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this
Section 2.06(d)  unless after the prepayment in
full of the Committed Revolving Loans and the Swing Line Loans, the
Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments then in effect.

 

(e)       
The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Administrative agent, at any
time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Term Loans in whole
or in part without premium or penalty, in an minimum principal
amount of $1,000,000; provided that in the event that, the
Borrowers shall make a prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to
this Section 2.06(e)  or
Section 2.06(f)  (solely in the case of clause
(ii) of the definition of Net Proceeds) or effect any
amendment to this Agreement which reduces the All-in Yield of the
Term Loans (other than in connection with a Change of Control or a
transformative acquisition referred to in the last sentence of this
paragraph) (x) prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
ratable account of each of the applicable Term Lenders, a
prepayment premium of 2.00% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Term Loans so prepaid or for which the All-In Yield has been
reduced pursuant to such amendment, as applicable, (y) on or
after to the first anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Borrowers shall pay to
the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the
applicable Term Lenders, a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans so prepaid or for
which the All-In Yield has been reduced pursuant to such amendment,
as applicable, and (z) on or after the second anniversary of
the Closing Date, no prepayment premium shall be payable.  Any
such prepayment premium shall be due and payable on the date of
such prepayment.  For purposes of this
Section 2.06(e) , a transformative acquisition is any
acquisition by QCP or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is
(i) not permitted by the terms of the Loan Documents
immediately prior to the consummation of such acquisition or
(ii) if permitted by the terms of the Loan Documents
immediately prior to the consummation of such acquisition, would
not provide QCP and its Restricted Subsidiaries with adequate
flexibility under the Loan Documents for the continuation and/or
expansion of their combined operations following such consummation,
as determined by the Borrowers in good faith.
 

(f)       
The Borrowers shall apply all Net Proceeds promptly upon receipt
thereof to prepay Term Loans in accordance with clauses
(d) and (e) of Section 2.08 . 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers may use a portion of
such Net Proceeds to prepay or repurchase any other First Lien
Debt required to be repaid or repurchased with such Net Proceeds,
in each case in an amount not to exceed the product of (x) the
amount of such Net Proceeds and (y) a fraction, (A) the
numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such
other First Lien Debt and (B) the denominator of which is the
sum of the outstanding principal amount of such other First Lien
Debt and the outstanding principal amount of all Classes of Term
Loans.
 

(g)       
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Section 2.06 to the contrary, (i) to the extent
that any Net Proceeds of any Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary
would otherwise be required to be applied pursuant to clause
(f) of this Section 2.06 but is prohibited or
delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the
United States of America, the portion of such Net Proceeds so
affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans
pursuant to clause (f) of this Section 2.10 so
long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit
repatriation to the United States of America (QCP hereby agreeing
to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions, if any, reasonably required
by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once
such
 
-64- 






 
repatriation of any of such affected Net
Proceeds that would otherwise be required to be applied pursuant to
clause (f) of this Section 2.06 is permitted under
the applicable local law, an amount equal to such Net Proceeds will
be promptly applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved
against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans
pursuant to clause (f) of this Section 2.06 , to
the extent provided therein and (ii) to the extent that QCP
has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of
such Net Proceeds would have a material adverse tax cost
consequence if so repatriated, the Net Proceeds so affected will
not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans pursuant to
clause (f) of this Section 2.06 ; provided
, that in the case of this clause (ii), on or before the date
on which any Net Proceeds would otherwise have been required to be
applied to prepayments pursuant to clause (f) of this
Section 2.06 , (x) the Borrowers apply an amount
equal to such Net Proceeds to such prepayments as if such Net
Proceeds had been received by the Borrowers rather than such
Foreign Subsidiary, less the amount of additional taxes that would
have been payable or reserved against if such Net Proceeds had been
repatriated (or, if less, Net Proceeds that would be calculated if
received by such Foreign Subsidiary) or (y) such Net Proceeds
are applied to the permanent repayment of Indebtedness of a Foreign
Subsidiary.
 

(h)       
Any prepayment pursuant to Sections 2.06(a)  through
(e)  above shall be given by a notice in substantially
the form of Exhibit J .
 

2.07    
Termination or Reduction of Commitments .
 

(a)       
Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments of each
Class will terminate on the applicable Revolving Maturity Date
for such Class.  On the Closing Date (after giving effect to
the funding of the Term Loans to be made on such date) the Term
Loan Commitments of each Lender as of the Closing Date will
terminate.
 

(b)       
The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent,
terminate the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, or from time to time
permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments;
provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by
the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 Noon three
(3) Business Days prior to the date of termination or
reduction (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably agree), (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in
an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) the Borrowers shall not
terminate or reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments if, after
giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder,
(A) the Total Revolving Outstandings would exceed the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments, (B) the Outstanding Amount of
Letters of Credit would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit or
(C) the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans would exceed
the Swing Line Sublimit.  Each notice of termination shall
specify such election to terminate and the effective date
thereof.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the
Revolving Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of
the Aggregate Revolving Commitments.  The amount of any such
Aggregate Revolving Commitment reduction shall not be applied to
the Letter of Credit Sublimit unless otherwise specified by the
Borrowers.  Any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments shall be applied to the Revolving Commitment of each
Revolving Lender according to its Applicable Percentage.  All
fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall be paid on the effective date
of such termination.  A notice delivered by the Borrowers
pursuant to this Section 2.07 may state that such
notice is conditioned upon an event, such as the effectiveness of
other credit facilities or the receipt of proceeds from the
issuance of Equity Interests or other Indebtedness or the receipt
of proceeds from a Disposition, in which case such notice may be
revoked by the Borrowers (by notice to the Administrative Agent on
or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
satisfied.

to the applicable Term Loan Maturity Date, an amount equal to 0.25%
of the aggregate principal amount of such Term Loans outstanding

and
 

(ii)       
in the event that any Incremental Term Loans are made, the

application thereof to reduce the amounts due on the succeeding
Term Loan Installment Dates under such Classes as directed by the

provided in the remaining scheduled amortization payments under
such Classes); provided , that any Lender, at its option,
may elect to decline any such prepayment from Net Proceeds of
Dispositions of any Term Loan held by it if it shall give written
notice to the Administrative Agent thereof by 5:00 p.m. Local
Time at least three Business Days prior to the date of such
prepayment (any such Lender, a “ Declining Lender
”) and on the date of any such prepayment, any amounts that
would otherwise have been applied to prepay Term Loans owing to
Declining Lenders shall instead be retained by the Borrowers for
application for any purpose not prohibited by this Agreement,
and

 

(ii)       
Any optional prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to
Section 2.06(e)  shall be applied to the remaining
installments of the Term Loans under the applicable Class or
Classes as the Borrowers may direct.
 

(e)       
Any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to
Section 2.06(f)  shall be applied so that the
aggregate amount of such prepayment is allocated among the Term

subject to the pro rata application to Loans outstanding within any
Class of Term Loans, the Borrowers may allocate such
prepayment in its discretion among the Class or Classes of
Term Loans as the Borrowers may specify (so long as the Term Loans
incurred on the Closing Date are allocated at least their pro rata
share of such prepayment).  Prior to any prepayment of any
Loan under any Commitment hereunder, the Borrowers shall select the
Borrowing or Borrowings under the applicable Commitment to be
prepaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of
such selection not later than 2:00 p.m. (i) in the case
of an Base Rate Borrowing, at least one Business Day before the
scheduled date of such prepayment (or in the case of a Swing Line
Loan, on the scheduled date of such prepayment) and (ii) in
the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, at least three Business Days
before the scheduled date of such prepayment (or, in each case such
shorter period acceptable to the Administrative Agent);
provided , that a notice of prepayment may state that such
notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, indentures or similar agreements or other transactions,
in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrowers (by
notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified
effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Each
repayment of a Borrowing (x) in the case of the Revolving
Commitment of any Class, shall be applied to the Revolving Loans
included in the repaid Borrowing such that each Revolving Lender
receives its ratable share of such repayment and (y) in all
other cases, shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the
repaid Borrowing.  All repayments of Loans shall be
accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid to the extent
required hereunder.
 

2.09

Applicable Interest .  Subject to the provisions of
subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan

each Interest Period applicable thereto at a rate per annum equal
to the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the
Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest
on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear

applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
 

(b)

(i)        
If any amount of principal or interest of any Loan, or any fee
payable by the Borrowers hereunder is not, in each case, paid or
reimbursed when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration
or otherwise, the relevant overdue amount shall bear interest at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws;
provided that no amount shall accrue pursuant to this
Section 2.09(b)  on any overdue amount,
reimbursement obligation or other amount payable to a Defaulting
Lender so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender.
 

(ii)       
Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest
on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon
demand.
 

(c)       
Interest Payment Date .  Interest on each Loan shall be
due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable
thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. 
Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the
terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief
Law.
 

2.10    
Fees .  In addition to certain fees described in
subsections (g) and (h) of Section 2.03
:
 

(a)       
Revolving Credit Fee .  The Borrowers shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender
(other than any Defaulting Lender) in accordance with its
Applicable Percentage, on the date that is the last Business Day of
March, June, September and
 
-67- 





 

December in each year and on
the date on which the Revolving Commitments of all Lenders shall be
terminated as provided herein, an unused line fee (the “
Unused Fee ”) equal to 0.50% times the actual daily
amount by which the Aggregate Revolving Commitments exceeds the
Outstanding Amount of Committed Revolving Loans and L/C
Obligations.  The Unused Fee shall accrue at all times during
the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Committed
Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans or L/C Obligations remain
outstanding, including at any time during which one or more of the
conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due
and payable quarterly in arrears (calculated on a 360-day basis) on
the last Business Day of each calendar quarter, commencing with the
first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the
Revolving Maturity Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on
demand).  The Unused Fee due to each Lender shall commence to
accrue on the Closing Date and shall cease to accrue on the date on
which the last of the Commitments of such Lender shall be
terminated as provided herein.

 

(b)       
Other Fees .
 

(i)        
The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own
account, in Dollars, fees in the amounts and at the times specified
in the Fee Letter.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid
and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever, absent
manifest error.
 

(ii)       
The Borrowers shall pay to the Lenders, in Dollars, such fees as
shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts
and at the times so specified.  Such fees shall be fully
earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason
whatsoever, absent manifest error.
 

2.11    
Computation of Interest and Fees .  All computations of
interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined
by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate) shall be made on the basis
of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days
elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be
made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which
results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if
computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest shall
accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and
shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on
which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any
Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall,
subject to Section 2.13(a) , bear interest for one
day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an
interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error.
 

2.12    
Evidence of Debt .
 

(a)       
The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one
or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The
accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each
Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of
the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the
interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or
any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect
the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing
with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the
accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such
matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall
control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of
any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers
shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the
Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such
Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. 
Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon
the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans
and payments with respect thereto.
 
-68- 





 

(b)        In
addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a),
each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing
the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters
of Credit and Swing Line Loans.  In the event of any conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative
Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such
matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall
control in the absence of manifest error.

 

2.13    
Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback
.
 

(a)       
General .  All payments to be made by the Borrowers
shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim,
defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be
made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective
Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable
Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in Same Day
Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified
herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this
Agreement be made in the United States.  The Administrative
Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable
Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such
payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such
Lender’s Lending Office.  All payments received by the
Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received
on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or
fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by
the Borrowers shall come due on a day other than a Business Day,
such due date shall be extended to the next following Business Day,
and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest
or fees, as the case may be.
 

(b)       
(i)  Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative
Agent .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any
Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of
such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base
Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in
accordance with and at the time required by
Section 2.02 ) and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding
amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its
share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative
Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree
to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without
duplication) such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date
of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of
a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate plus any
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by
the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and
(B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrowers, the
interest rate applicable to the Loans constituting such
Borrowing.  If the Borrowers and such Lender shall pay such
interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping
period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the
Borrowers the amount of such interest paid by the Borrowers for
such period.  In the event the Borrowers pay such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall reduce the
principal amount of such Borrowing.  If such Lender pays its
share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then
the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan
included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrowers
shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrowers may have
against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the
Administrative Agent.
 

(ii)      
Payments by the Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative
Agent .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
applicable Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder
 
-69- 





 
that the Borrowers will not make such payment,
the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made
such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders
or applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. 
In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment,
then each of the applicable Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer,
as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender
or such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
 

A notice of the Administrative Agent
to any Lender or the Borrowers with respect to any amount owing
under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest
error.
 

(c)       
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent .  If any
Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any
Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not
made available to the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent because
the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in
Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to
such Lender, without interest.
 

(d)       
Obligations of Lenders Several .  The obligations of
the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in
Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans, to make payments pursuant
to Section 10.04(c)  are several and not
joint.  The failure of any applicable Lender to make any Loan,
to fund any such participation or to make any payment under
Section 10.04(c)  on any date required hereunder
shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation
to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its
participation or to make its payment under
Section 10.04(c) .
 

(e)       
Funding Source .  Nothing herein shall be deemed to
obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any
particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any
Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan
in any particular place or manner.
 

2.14    
Sharing of Payments by Lenders .  If any Lender shall,
by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise,
obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of
the Loans made by it, the participations in L/C Obligations or in
Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lender’s
receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such
Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than
its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash
at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in
L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make
such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit
of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued
interest on their respective Loans or such other amounts owing
them, as applicable; provided that:
 

(i)        
if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,
such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without
interest; and
 

(ii)       
the provisions of this Section 2.14 shall not be
construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of
the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms
of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from
the existence of a Defaulting Lender or Disqualified Institution),
(y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for
in
 
-70- 





 

Section 2.17
or (z) any payment obtained by
a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C
Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant,
other than an assignment to any Credit Party or any Subsidiary
thereof (as to which the provisions of this
Section 2.14 shall apply).

 

The Borrowers consent to the
foregoing and agree, to the extent they may effectively do so under
applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant
to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrowers’ rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such
participation.

2.16    
Incremental Commitments .
 

(a)       
The Borrowers may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent
from time to time, request Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as applicable, in an
amount not to exceed the Incremental Amount available at the time
such Incremental Commitments are established from one or more
Incremental Term Lenders and/or Incremental Revolving Facility
Lenders (which may include any existing Lender) willing to provide
such Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Facility
Commitments, as the case may be, in their own discretion;
provided , that each Incremental Revolving Facility Lender
providing a commitment to make Revolving Loans shall be subject to
the approval of the Administrative Agent and, to the extent the
same would be required for an assignment under
Section 10.06 , the applicable L/C Issuer and the Swing
Line Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld)
unless such Incremental Revolving Facility Lender is a Revolving
Lender, an Affiliate of a Revolving Lender or an Approved Fund of a
Revolving Lender.  Such notice shall set forth (i) the
amount of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental
Revolving Facility Commitments being requested (which shall be in
minimum increments of $5,000,000 and a minimum amount of
$20,000,000, or equal to the remaining Incremental Amount or, in
each case, such lesser amount approved by the Administrative
Agent), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan
Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are
requested to become effective, (iii) in the case of
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, whether such
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are to be
(x) commitments to make additional Revolving Loans on the same
terms as the Committed Revolving Loans or (y) commitments to
make revolving loans with pricing terms, final maturity dates,
participation in mandatory prepayments or commitment reductions
and/or other terms different from the initial Revolving Loans
(“ Other Revolving Loans ”) and (iv) in the
case of Incremental Term Loan Commitments, whether such Incremental
Term Loan Commitments are to be (x) commitments to make term
loans with terms identical to any existing Class of Term Loans
or (y) commitments to make term loans with pricing, maturity,
amortization, participation in mandatory prepayments and/or other
terms different from the Term Loans (“ Other Term
Loans ”).
 

(b)       
The Borrowers and each Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental
Revolving Facility Lender shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such
other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably
specify to evidence the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such
Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental Revolving Facility
Commitment of such Incremental Revolving Facility Lender. 
Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of
the applicable Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving
Facility Commitments; provided , that:
 

(i)        
any commitments to make additional Term Loans of an existing
Class of Term Loans and/or additional Committed Revolving
Loans shall have the same terms as such existing Term Loans or
Committed Revolving Loans, respectively;
 
-71- 





 

(ii)       
the Other Term Loans incurred pursuant to clause (a) of this
Section 2.16 shall rank pari passu or, at the option of
the Borrowers, junior in right of security with the existing Term
Loans ( provided , that if such Other Term Loans rank junior
in right of security with the existing Term Loans, the Liens
securing such Other Term Loans shall be junior liens and, for the
avoidance of doubt, such Other Term Loans shall not be subject to
clause (vii) below);

 

(iii)       the
final maturity date of any such Other Term Loans shall be no
earlier than the Term Loan Maturity Date and, except as to pricing,
amortization, final maturity date, participation in mandatory
prepayments and ranking as to security (which shall, subject to the
other clauses of this proviso, be determined by the Borrowers and
the Incremental Term Lenders in their sole discretion), shall have
(x) substantially similar terms as the Term Loans or
(y) such other terms (including as to guarantees and
collateral) as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent;

 

(iv)       the
Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any such Other Term Loans
shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to
Maturity of the existing Term Loans;

 

(v)       
Other Revolving Loans incurred pursuant to clause (a) of this
Section 2.16 shall rank pari passu in right of security
with the Committed Revolving Loans;

 

(vi)       the
final maturity date of any such Other Revolving Loans shall be no
earlier than the Revolving Maturity Date with respect to the
Committed Revolving Loans and, except as to pricing, final maturity
date, participation in mandatory prepayments and commitment
reductions (which shall, subject to the other clauses of this
proviso, be determined by the Borrowers and the Incremental
Revolving Facility Lenders in their sole discretion), shall have
(x) substantially similar terms as the Initial Revolving Loans
or (y) such other terms (including as to guarantees and
collateral) as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent; and
 

(vii)     
with respect to any Other Term Loan incurred pursuant to clause
(a) of this Section 2.16 that ranks pari passu in
right of security with the initial Term Loans, the All-in Yield
shall be the same as that applicable to the Term Loans on the
Closing Date, except that the All-in Yield in respect of any such
Other Term Loan may exceed the All-in Yield in respect of such Term
Loans on the Closing Date by no more than 0.50%, or if it does so
exceed such All-in Yield (such difference, the “ Term
Yield Differential ”) then the Applicable Rate (or the
“LIBOR floor” as provided in the following proviso)
applicable to such Term Loans shall be increased such that after
giving effect to such increase, the Term Yield Differential shall
not exceed 0.50%; provided that, to the extent any portion
of the Term Yield Differential is attributable to a higher
“LIBOR floor” being applicable to such Other Term
Loans, such floor shall only be included in the calculation of the
Term Yield Differential to the extent such floor is greater than
the Eurocurrency Rate in effect for an Interest Period of three
months’ duration at such time, and, with respect to such
excess, the “LIBOR floor” applicable to the outstanding
Term Loans shall be increased to an amount not to exceed the
“LIBOR floor” applicable to such Other Term Loans prior
to any increase in the Applicable Rate applicable to such Term
Loans then outstanding.
 

Each party hereto hereby agrees
that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption
Agreement, this Agreement shall be amended to the extent (but only
to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the
Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving
Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in
Section 10.01 .  Any amendment to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document that is necessary to effect the
provisions of this Section 2.16 and any such collateral
and other documentation shall be deemed “Loan
Documents” hereunder and may be memorialized in writing by
the Administrative Agent with the Borrowers’ consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the other parties
hereto.
 
-72- 





 

(c)       
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment
or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment under clauses
(a) and (b) above shall become effective under this
Section 2.16 unless (i) on the date of such
effectiveness, to the extent required by the relevant Incremental
Assumption Agreement, the conditions set forth in clauses
(a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be
satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a
certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a
Responsible Officer of the Borrowers, (ii) no Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom and
(iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received customary
legal opinions, board resolutions and other customary closing
certificates and documentation as required by the relevant
Incremental Assumption Agreement and, to the extent required by the
Administrative Agent, consistent with those delivered on the
Closing Date under Section 4.02 and such additional
customary documents and filings (including amendments to the
Mortgages and other Security Documents and title endorsement
bringdowns) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to
assure that the Incremental Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility
Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are
secured by the Collateral ratably with (or, to the extent set forth
in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, junior to) one
or more Classes of then-existing Term Loans and Revolving Facility
Loans.
 

(d)       
Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative
Agent may take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to
ensure that (i) all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other
Term Loans), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing
of the outstanding applicable Class of Term Loans on a pro
rata basis, and (ii) all Revolving Loans in respect of
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments (other than Other
Revolving Loans), when originally made, are included in each
Borrowing of the applicable Class of outstanding Revolving
Loans on a pro rata basis.  The Borrowers agree that
Section 3.05 shall apply to any conversion of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans reasonably required by
the Administrative Agent to effect the foregoing.
 

(e)       
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
including Section 2.14 (which provisions shall not be
applicable to clauses (e) through (i) of this
Section 2.16 ), pursuant to one or more offers made
from time to time by the Borrowers to all Lenders of any
Class of Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitments, on a pro
rata basis (based, in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any
Class of Term Loans, on the aggregate outstanding Term Loans
of such Class and, in the case of an offer to the Lenders
under any Revolving Facility, on the aggregate outstanding
Revolving Commitments under such Revolving Facility, as applicable)
and on the same terms (“ Pro Rata Extension Offers
”), the Borrowers are hereby permitted to consummate
transactions with individual Lenders from time to time to extend
the maturity date of such Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments
of such Class and to otherwise modify the terms of such
Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments of such Class pursuant
to the terms of the relevant Pro Rata Extension Offer (including,
without limitation, increasing the interest rate or fees payable in
respect of such Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments and/or
modifying the amortization schedule in respect of such
Lender’s Loans).  For the avoidance of doubt, the
reference to “on the same terms” in the preceding
sentence shall mean, (i) in the case of an offer to the
Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, that all of the Term
Loans of such Class are offered to be extended for the same
amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable
with respect to such extension are the same and (ii) in the
case of an offer to the Lenders under any Revolving Facility, that
all of the Revolving Commitments of such Revolving Facility are
offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the
interest rate changes and fees payable with respect to such
extension are the same.  Any such extension (an “
Extension ”) agreed to between the Borrowers and any
such Lender (an “ Extending Lender ”) will be
established under this Agreement by implementing an Incremental
Term Loan for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing
Term Loan (such extended Term Loan, an “ Extended Term
Loan ”) or an Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment
for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing Revolving
Commitment (such extended
 
-73- 





 
Revolving Commitment, an “ Extended
Revolving Facility Commitment ”).  Each Pro Rata
Extension Offer shall specify the date on which the Borrowers
propose that the Extended Term Loan shall be made, which shall be a
date not earlier than five Business Days after the date on which
notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter
period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable
discretion).
 

(f)       
The Borrowers and each Extending Lender shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and
such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall
reasonably specify to evidence the Extended Term Loans and/or
Extended Revolving Facility Commitments of such Extending
Lender.  Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify
the terms of the applicable Extended Term Loans and/or Extended
Revolving Facility Commitments; provided , that
(i) except as to interest rates, fees and any other pricing
terms (which interest rates, fees and other pricing terms shall not
be subject to the provisions set forth in
Section 2.16(b)(vii) ), and amortization, final
maturity date and participation in prepayments and commitment
reductions (which shall, subject to clauses (ii) and
(iii) of this proviso, be determined by the Borrowers and set
forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), the Extended Term Loans
shall have (x) the same terms as an existing Class of
Term Loans or (y) such other terms as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii) the final
maturity date of any Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than
the latest Term Loan Maturity Date in effect on the date of
incurrence, (iii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any
Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted
Average Life to Maturity of the Class of Term Loans to which
such offer relates, (iv) except as to interest rates, fees,
any other pricing terms, participation in mandatory prepayments and
commitment reductions and final maturity (which shall be
determined by the Borrowers and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension
Offer), any Extended Revolving Facility Commitment shall have
(x) the same terms as an existing Class of Revolving
Commitments or (y) have such other terms as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and, in respect
of any other terms that would affect the rights or duties of any
L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, such terms as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer or the Swing Line
Lender, (v) any Extended Revolving Facility Commitments may
participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but
not greater than a pro rata basis) than the initial Revolving Loans
in any voluntary or mandatory prepayment or commitment reduction
hereunder and (vi) any Extended Term Loans may participate on
a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a greater
than pro rata basis) than the Term Loans in any mandatory
prepayment hereunder.  Upon the effectiveness of any
Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be amended
to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the
existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended
Revolving Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in
Section 10.01 .  Any such deemed amendment may be
memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent with the
Borrowers’ consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and
furnished to the other parties hereto.  If provided in any
Incremental Assumption Agreement with respect to any Extended
Revolving Facility Commitments, and with the consent of the Swing
Line Lender and each L/C Issuer, participations in Swing Line Loans
and Letters of Credit shall be reallocated to lenders holding such
Extended Revolving Facility Commitments in the manner specified in
such Incremental Assumption Agreement, including upon effectiveness
of such Extended Revolving Facility Commitment or upon or prior to
the maturity date for any Class of Revolving
Commitments.
 

(g)       
Upon the effectiveness of any such Extension, the applicable
Extending Lender’s Term Loan will be automatically designated
an Extended Term Loan and/or such Extending Lender’s
Revolving Commitment will be automatically designated an Extended
Revolving Facility Commitment.  For purposes of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, (i) if such Extending Lender is
extending a Term Loan, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have
an Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Extended Term
Loan and (ii) if such Extending Lender is extending a
Revolving Commitment, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have
an Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment having the terms of
such Extended Revolving Facility Commitment.

(h)                              
Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document
(including without limitation this Section 2.16 ), (i) the
aggregate amount of Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving
Facility Commitments will not be included in the calculation of the
Incremental Amount (except as part of future calculations of clause
(b) of the definition thereof), (ii) no Extended Term Loan or
Extended Revolving Facility Commitment is required to be in any
minimum amount or any minimum increment, (iii) any Extending Lender
may extend all or any portion of its Term Loans and/or Revolving
Commitment pursuant to one or more Pro Rata Extension Offers
(subject to applicable proration in the case of over participation)
(including the extension of any Extended Term Loan and/or Extended
Revolving Facility Commitment), (iv) there shall be no condition
under this Agreement to any Extension of any Loan or Commitment at
any time or from time to time other than notice to the
Administrative Agent of such Extension and the terms of the
Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment
implemented thereby, (v) all Extended Term Loans, Extended
Revolving Facility Commitments and all obligations in respect
thereof shall be Obligations of the relevant Credit Parties under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by the
Collateral on a pari passu basis with all other Obligations
relating to an existing Class of Term Loans of the relevant Credit
Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (vi)
neither any L/C Issuer nor the Swingline Lender shall be obligated
to provide Swing Line Loans or issue Letters of Credit under such
Extended Revolving Facility Commitments unless it shall have
consented thereto and (vii) there shall be no obligor in respect of
any such Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Facility
Commitments that is not a Credit Party.
 

(i)                                  
Each Extension shall be consummated
pursuant to procedures set forth in the associated Pro Rata
Extension Offer; provided , that the Borrowers shall
cooperate with the Administrative Agent prior to making any Pro
Rata Extension Offer to establish reasonable procedures with
respect to mechanical provisions relating to such Extension,
including, without limitation, timing, rounding and other
adjustments.
 

(j)                                  
Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.14 (which
provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (j) through (k) of
this Section 2.16 ), the Borrowers may by written notice to
the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional tranches
of term loans under this Agreement (such loans, “
Refinancing Term Loans ”), the net cash proceeds of
which are used to refinance in whole or in part any Class of Term
Loans.  Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a
“ Refinancing Effective Date ”) on which the
Borrowers proposes that the Refinancing Term Loans shall be made,
which shall be a date not earlier than five Business Days after the
date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent
(or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in
its reasonable discretion); provided , that:
 

(i)                                  
before and after giving effect to
the borrowing of such Refinancing Term Loans on the Refinancing
Effective Date (x) each of the conditions set forth in clauses (a)
and (b) of Section 4.02 , to the extent required by the
relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement governing such
Refinancing Term Loans, shall be satisfied and (y) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result
therefrom;
 

(ii)                              
the final maturity date of the
Refinancing Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Term Loan
Maturity Date of the refinanced Term Loans;
 

(iii)                          
the Weighted Average Life to
Maturity of such Refinancing Term Loans shall be no shorter than
the then-remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the
refinanced Term Loans;
 
-75- 





 

(iv)                          
the aggregate principal amount of
the Refinancing Term Loans shall not exceed the outstanding
principal amount of the refinanced Term Loans plus amounts used to
pay fees, premiums, costs and expenses (including original issue
discount) and accrued interest associated therewith;
 

(v)                              
all other terms applicable to such
Refinancing Term Loans (other than provisions relating to original
issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates or any other pricing
terms and optional prepayment or mandatory prepayment or redemption
terms, which shall be as agreed between the Borrowers and the
Lenders providing such Refinancing Term Loans) taken as a whole
shall be substantially similar to, or not materially less favorable
to QCP and its Restricted Subsidiaries than, the terms, taken as a
whole, applicable to the Term Loans (except to the extent such
covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the Term
Loan Maturity Date or are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent), as determined by the Borrowers in good
faith.  In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Borrowers may establish Refinancing Term Loans to refinance and/or
replace all or any portion of the Revolving Commitments, so long as
(i) the aggregate amount of such Refinancing Term Loans does not
exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments terminated at
the time of incurrence thereof, (ii) if the amount of such
Refinancing Term Loans is less than the amount of Revolving Loans
outstanding under such Revolving Commitments at the time of
incurrence of such Refinancing Term Loans, the Borrowers shall use
all of the proceeds of such Refinancing Term Loans to repay such
Revolving Loans and otherwise, the Borrowers shall use a portion of
the proceeds of such Refinancing Term Loans to repay all Revolving
Loans outstanding under such Revolving Commitments at the time of
incurrence of such Refinancing Term Loans (it being understood that
(x) such Refinancing Term Loans may be provided by the Lenders
holding the Revolving Commitments being terminated and/or by any
other person that would be an Eligible Assignee hereunder and (y)
the proceeds of such Refinancing Term Loans shall not constitute
Net Proceeds hereunder), (iii) the Weighted Average Life to
Maturity of the Refinancing Term Loans shall be no shorter than the
remaining life to termination of the terminated Revolving
Commitments, (iv) the final maturity date of the Refinancing Term
Loans shall be no earlier than the termination date of the
terminated Revolving Commitments and (v) all other terms applicable
to such Refinancing Term Loans (other than provisions relating to
original issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates or any other
pricing terms and optional prepayment or mandatory prepayment or
redemption terms, which shall be as agreed between the Borrowers
and the Lenders providing such Refinancing Term Loans) taken as a
whole shall be substantially similar to, or not materially less
favorable to the Borrowers and its Subsidiaries than, the terms,
taken as a whole, applicable to the Term Loans (except to the
extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period
after the Term Loan Maturity Date or are otherwise reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent), as determined by the
Borrowers in good faith;
 

(vi)                          
with respect to Refinancing Term
Loans secured by Liens on the Collateral that rank junior in right
of security to an existing Class of Term Loans, such Liens will be
subject to a junior intercreditor agreement in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent;
 

(vii)                      
there shall be no obligor in respect
of such Refinancing Term Loans that is not a Credit Party;
and
 

(viii)                  
the Refinancing Term Loans may
participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but
not a greater than pro rata basis) than the Term Loans in any
mandatory prepayment hereunder.
 
-76- 





 

(k)                              
The Borrowers may approach any
Lender or any other person that would be an Eligible Assignee
pursuant to Section 10.06 to provide all or a portion of the
Refinancing Term Loans; provided , that any Lender offered
or approached to provide all or a portion of the Refinancing Term
Loans may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a
Refinancing Term Loan.  Any Refinancing Term Loans made on any
Refinancing Effective Date shall be designated an additional Class
of Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement; provided ,
further , that any Refinancing Term Loans may, to the extent
provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement
governing such Refinancing Term Loans, be designated as an increase
in any previously established Class of Term Loans made to the
Borrowers.

Cash Collateral
.
 

(a)                               
Certain Credit Support
Events .  (i)
 (A) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any L/C
Issuer (x) if any L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial
drawing request under any Letter of Credit issued by it and such
drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (y) if, as of the
Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation (other than in
respect of an Extended Letter of Credit) for any reason remains
outstanding or (B) upon the request of the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 8.02 , the Borrowers shall, in each
case, promptly (and in any event no later than thee (3) Business
Days after receipt of such request) Cash Collateralize the then
Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations.
 

(ii)                              
If at any time that there shall
exist a Defaulting Lender, promptly upon the request of the
Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, the
Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral
in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after
giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral
provided by such Defaulting Lender).
 

(iii)                          
In addition, if the Administrative
Agent notifies the Borrowers at any time that the Outstanding
Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time exceeds 105% of the
Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then, within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall
Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount equal to the
amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations
exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit; provided that Cash
Collateral provided pursuant to this Section 2.17(a)(iii)
shall be refunded to the Borrowers when the Outstanding Amount of
all L/C Obligations is less than 105% of the Letter of Credit
Sublimit then in effect.
 

(iv)                          
The Administrative Agent may, at any
time and from time to time after the initial deposit of Cash
Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral be provided as
required in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent in
order to protect against the results of exchange rate
fluctuations.
 

(b)                              
Grant of Security
Interest .  All Cash
Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds
subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, interest
bearing deposit accounts with KeyBank National Association or
otherwise with or at the direction of the Collateral Agent, in each
case subject to a control agreement in favor of, and reasonably
satisfactory to, the Collateral Agent.  Each Borrower, and to
the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to
(and subjects to the control of) the Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of the Collateral Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Revolving
Lenders (including the Swing Line Lender), and agrees to maintain,
a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit
accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so
provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the
foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash
Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.17(c)
.  If at any time the Collateral Agent reasonably determines
that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person
other than the Collateral Agent as herein provided, or that the
total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable
Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the
Borrowers or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon
demand by the Collateral Agent, pay or provide to the Collateral
Agent additional Cash Collateral in an aggregate amount equal to
the excess of (x) the aggregate amount of such applicable Fronting
Exposure and obligations, over (y) the total amount of funds or
other credit support, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the
Collateral Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of any
such right and claim.
