Company Summary


Have you ever wished that you could monitor all of your favorite websites using a single alerting platform so you don't have to setup and manage accounts with dozens of sites to watch for, get email updates on specific products/sales for items YOU want instead of weekly ads where stores/sites tell you what THEY want to sell you, versus you creating your own personal/private and real time newsletter on the exact online items you want to monitor.

With TrackIF you can FREE! No more setting up multiple accounts and having saved searches in multiple sites (assuming they even have saved searches/alerting on their site at all) just to see if items/products you are interested in become available or change prices.

You can do it all with your FREE TrackIF account and the TrackIF browser plugin. Simply register with TrackIF, download the TrackIF plugin, and you can start receiving TrackIF alerts on any site on the web.

Product-tracking startup MyAlerts expands into recruiting - Talent Tech Labs









































































 















					Product-tracking startup MyAlerts expands into recruiting				
December 13th, 2016  Product-tracking startup MyAlerts Inc. closed on $2 million in funding as it expands into a market close to CEO Doug Berg’s entrepreneurial roots: recruiting. Job seekers can use it to build a career profile and monitor corporate job boards. Instead of getting product notifications, they can get an alert when a new position is posted, for example.
The tool aims to make job boards more engaging for jobseekers and employers, Berg said. “Most career sites are static and black holes.”

Product-tracking startup MyAlerts Inc. closed on $2 million in funding as it expands into a market close to CEO Doug Berg's entrepreneurial roots: recruiting.
Minneapolis-based MyAlerts makes technology that consumers use to monitor products for sale online and receive notifications when, for instance, those items go on sale or are back in stock. The company has lined up up large retail partners for that service, including Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) and Macy's.

Now, MyAlerts is using the same technology as the basis for a recruiting tool, Berg said in an interview. Job seekers can use it to build a career profile and monitor corporate job boards. Instead of getting product notifications, they can get an alert when a new position is posted, for example.




The tool aims to make job boards more engaging for jobseekers and employers, Berg said. “Most career sites are static and black holes."
Berg is well versed in the recruiting market. He started IT-focused career site techies.com in the late 1990s and founded Jobs2Web Inc., which SuccessFactors bought 2011 for $110 million.
Berg launched MyAlerts (previously namedTrackIf) about three years ago. The company has about 25 full-time employees and additional offices in San Francisco and Denver.
The $2 million investment is an expansion of a $5 million round it closed on in 2015, Berg said. The same investors participated.

Katharine Grayson covers med tech, clean tech, technology, health care and venture capital.
