The fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing at least 80% of its net assets in companies of any size that have paid consistently rising dividends.



            Strategy Statement
        








"Using a rigorous, research-driven stock selection process, we only consider a company if it passes our five screens and then only buy if they are attractively priced relative to historical valuations."

            Strategy, Benefits, Results
        



            Strategy
        We employ a unique, disciplined approach to stock selection. Companies must meet the following criteria before stocks are considered for purchase:

Consistent Dividend Increases. We only consider companies that have increased their dividend in at least 8 out the last 10 years, without a decrease.
Substantial Dividend Increases. We look for companies that have doubled their dividend over the last 10 years.
Strong Balance Sheets. We invest in companies with strong financials and low levels of long-term debt.
Reinvested Earnings for Future Long-Term Growth. We search for companies that reinvest at least 35% of their earnings in their own future growth.
Attractive Price. We purchase shares that are attractively priced relative to historical valuations and stocks must have a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) in the lower half of its range over the last 10 years or less than the current P/E ratio of stocks in the S&P 500 Index.



            Benefits
        
Diversification. We invest in companies across the entire market-cap spectrum, with a variety of industries and sector.
A Record of Lower Volatility.
Value Expertise. Investors can benefit from our veteran management team with extensive value investing experience.

            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Value securities may not increase in price as anticipated, or may decline further in value.
For stocks paying dividends, dividends are not guaranteed, and can increase, decrease or be totally eliminated without notice.
Smaller- and mid-sized company stocks carry special risks, including greater price volatility over the short term.
Smaller and mid-sized companies often have relatively small revenues, limited product lines and a small market share.
These and other risks are described more fully in the fund’s prospectus.

Important Legal Information

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Value securities may not increase in price as anticipated or may decline further in value. For stocks paying dividends, dividends are not guaranteed, and can increase, decrease or be totally eliminated without notice.  While smaller and midsize companies may offer substantial opportunities for capital growth, they also involve heightened risks and should be considered speculative. Historically, smaller- and midsize-company securities have been more volatile in price than larger company securities, especially over the short term. These and other risks are detailed in the fund's prospectus.

Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.
For more information on any of our funds, contact your financial advisor or download a free prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.
Performance data represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. Current performance may differ from figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A measure of the fund's volatility relative to the market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the market. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Percentage of the fund's returns explained by movements in the S&P 500 Index. 100 equals perfect correlation to the index. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.
Source: Morningstar®. The style box reveals a fund's investment style. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Placement is determined by fund portfolio holding figures most recently entered into Morningstar's database and corresponding market conditions. Shaded areas show the past 3 years of quarterly data. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.

Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

TRUST IS MEASURABLE 

                                        
                                            
                                            

"We tend to judge ourselves by our intent and others by their observable behavior." - Stephen M. R. Covey Author, The Speed of Trust 





CASE STUDY- CITY OF PROVO, UT

                                        
                                            
                                            
A city government is transformed by institutionalizing high-trust behavior as the core of their culture.


Trust always impacts two measurable outcomes: Speed and Cost. Provo City leaders have learned that trust is an economic, financial lever – and it is a performance multiplier. 


Mayor John Curtis tells the story

CULTURE IS THE ULTIMATE ADVANTAGE

"Organizational culture eats strategy for breakfast, lunch and dinner." 
- Peter Drucker

In all of business the one thing that can't be replicated by a competitor is your culture.
