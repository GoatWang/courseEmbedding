Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

How much more action can a reader take ...Bycindycon March 22, 2015Format: Kindle EditionOMG!  How much more action can a reader take?  Wow!  This episode had me on the edge of my chair throughout the entire book.  Emily Cantore, you are wicked.  If the author didn't have your attention before part 4, she sure does now.  Can't wait to read the next book in this tantalizing series.  Still has lots of hot, erotic sex, but now we've added some suspense to go with that.  What's next?  I guess it's time to continue reading to find out.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsBedtime readByCeonas Roseon July 16, 2013Format: Kindle EditionI have discovered that each one of the parts of this book are a perfect read right before bed. The writing is good and easy to follow. The story line is intriguing and keeps me coming back for more details. Each part of the book is only about 30-50 pages so gives short snack sizes. The sex scenes are hot and original. I found I read all of the details instead of getting bored and skimming. It's nice to see an erotic author that tells a story that happens to have erotic scenes. Don't get me wrong this is not for the faint of heart, there are many very hot erotic scenes in this part and all the others leading up to this one.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsSizzling Sweet MysteryByLea loves hot readson July 17, 2013Format: Kindle EditionAn emotionally sacred dominant billionaire, a determined but some time oblivious submissive, a little mystery and a lot of hot bdsm erotica.

            ‘Cake Boss’ Star Buddy Valastro Closes Bakeries As Tributes Pour In After Mother’s Death                    
Emily Hutchinson



Cake Boss star Buddy Valastro has confirmed that his family’s string of bakeries will be closed on June 27 as the Valastro family continue to mourn the death of their late mother.
The announcement was made on the official Instagram page for the Carlos Bakery franchise on June 24 and confirmed that all locations across the globe will remain closed for a whole day to pay tribute to the late star of the TLC reality show.
Confirming that every single Carlo’s Bakery – which has several locations across New Jersey, New York, Texas, Nevada, Georgia, Florida, Connecticut and even a shop in Brazil – will be closed for a 24 hour period, the message noted that the Cake Boss bakeries will then begin to start operating as normal again on June 28.
It was confirmed last week that Mary, affectionately known as Momma Mary, had passed away from her battle with ALS at age 69 after the famous family confirmed the sad news on social media.
Buddy shared a heart-warming message for his mother on Instagram on June 22, and now the rest of the Valastro family – whose lives have been documented on the past eight seasons of TLC’s reality show Cake Boss – have followed suit with messages of their own for the late reality star who revealed her ALS battle on the show.

Buddy’s wife Lisa called her mother-in-law “a strong beautiful woman” alongside a black and white photo of the trio together, while the baker’s sister Mary wrote a sincere message for her late mother on the photo sharing site, “your pain and suffering is gone your [sic] forever in our heart.”
Grace, the late Mary’s eldest daughter, also posted a message to social media following her mother’s passing alongside a photo of the two together in happier times.
“I can’t believe you are gone. You were an incredibly strong woman and taught me so much,” the Cake Boss star and oldest of Buddy’s four sisters wrote online shortly after the family confirmed that Mary had died. “I know you are in a much better place now. Give Daddy a kiss for me.”
But while Carlo’s Bakery locations across the globe will remain closed as the family continues to mourn, Grace also shared a sweet photo from her nephew’s recent graduation which appeared to take place just days after Mary’s death.

The eldest of the Valastro sisters shared a sweet smiling photo with nephew Buddy – the son of Madeline and Mauro who is also featured heavily on the TLC show – and shared with fans that he had just graduated. Buddy appeared to be surrounded by family for what was sure to be a bittersweet celebration.
The young Buddy – who is thought to be named after his Cake Boss star Uncle – also shared several photos to his own account of himself and his late grandmother.
One heart-warming throwback family photo showed himself and his cousins with Mary, while the young Cake Boss star referred to his recent graduation and told his late grandmother in the image’s caption, “I know you were right there beside me yesterday gram love and miss you so much.”
