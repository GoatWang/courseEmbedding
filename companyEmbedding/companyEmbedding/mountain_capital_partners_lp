About | Mountain Capital Management






















































































About













About Mountain Capital
Mountain Capital is an energy private equity firm established in 2015 by a team of experienced professionals led by Sam Oh. Mountain Capital aims to be the partner of choice for the middle market, focusing on growth and turnaround capital investments in the energy sector.
Our firm is led by a unique blend of energy professionals with complementary backgrounds and skill sets who collectively have more than 125 years of experience in the industry. Mr. Oh and our team have developed a distinctive investment approach with a penchant for complicated situations that require sophisticated understanding of the capital structure, deep knowledge of the underlying assets and a gentle approach to management and stakeholders.
We are dedicated to capital preservation and long-term value creation for our investors by avoiding “hot” new areas and “emerging” trends, choosing instead to identify and partner with proven management teams with geographic focus in known high-quality basins that would benefit from the application of modern technology.

Focus
Mountain Capital targets control investments in the energy sector. We seek to partner with high quality, proven operators to pursue investment opportunities that we believe offer positively skewed upside opportunities with potential downside protection in mind. Mountain Capital believes that good value is often found by working with partners who have a specific operating angle or edge and by pursuing opportunities that are complex in nature.


Sourcing
Mountain Capital believes that our team’s deep energy sector knowledge and thematic approach to sourcing investments will allow us to develop unique investment opportunities. Mountain Capital expects to draw on our team’s extensive network of management teams and oil and gas industry contacts for significant deal flow. In addition, Mountain Capital expects that its concentrated portfolio and its commitment to active portfolio management will give the Fund an advantage in attracting opportunities.


Value Creation
Mountain Capital operates with the strong belief that value is created during all phases of the investment, from investment research & development through post-investment and exit. Mr. Oh has assembled the team at Mountain Capital based on each individual’s experience, relationships and ability to contribute to each of these phases. Mountain Capital intends to be an active investor by working with management teams in a number of strategic capacities.

AmWINS Group, Inc. Partners with New Mountain Capital













Posted on 17 Apr 2012













AmWINS Group, Inc., a global distributor of specialty insurance products and services, announced today that its management and employee shareholders have reached a definitive agreement to partner with New Mountain Capital in a growth-oriented recapitalization valued at approximately $1.3 billion. Other terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., AmWINS is a leading specialty insurance broker placing over $7 billion of premiums through its relationships with more than 16,000 retail brokerage firms and more than 1,000 insurance carriers.  AmWINS’ expertise covers a wide range of specialty insurance products and services in the property/casualty and group benefits insurance marketplace.  With over 2,300 employees in 87 offices located across 21 countries, AmWINS’ deep industry knowledge and capabilities, extensive geographic reach and independent relationships with insurance carriers and retail insurance brokers allow it to serve as a critical intermediary in the complex and highly fragmented specialty insurance market. “This new partnership allows AmWINS to continue its growth trajectory both organically and through strategic acquisitions,” said M. Steven DeCarlo, CEO of AmWINS.  “As we celebrate our 10 year anniversary this year, we are very pleased to partner with New Mountain Capital as we begin this exciting next chapter in AmWINS’ global development.  This transaction demonstrates the value of the AmWINS industry-leading platform and is a testament to our employees’ hard work, dedication and commitment to building our business and focusing on our customers.  We are confident that New Mountain will be a value added partner as we focus on the growth and innovation initiatives that have made AmWINS’ first decade such an outstanding success.” “New Mountain has had a longtime effort in the insurance sector, and we are delighted to become a long-term partner with AmWINS, the clear leader in the specialty insurance distribution market,” said Alok Singh, Managing Director at New Mountain Capital.  “We first began partnership discussions with Steve DeCarlo, Skip Cooper, Scott Purviance and the rest of the AmWINS team over a year ago, and we believe they have built a best-in-class firm that is well positioned to continue its outstanding history of growth and success.  AmWINS has established a reputation for specialty insurance knowledge, superior service, world class technology and an outstanding culture.  We look forward to working closely with the company as it continues building and expanding the industry’s leading independent specialty distribution platform for insurance and benefits products and services.” The transaction also completes a successful partnership between AmWINS and Parthenon Capital Partners.  “We have greatly enjoyed working with AmWINS and are proud to have contributed in building the industry’s leading franchise,” said Brian Golson, a Managing Partner at Parthenon Capital Partners.  “Partnering with world class companies to achieve significant growth is what we aim to do – and working with Steve DeCarlo and the AmWINS team has been a shining example of this strategy.”  DeCarlo noted that employee shareholders will continue to own more than 30 percent, valued at over $160 million, of AmWINS equity at the conclusion of the recapitalization.  There will be no changes to AmWINS’ senior management, local management or operational teams as a result of this transaction.  Subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close within the next 60 days.  Financial Technology Partners LP, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Willis Capital Markets & Advisory acted as financial advisors to AmWINS. Credit Suisse and Macquarie Capital acted as financial advisors to New Mountain.About AmWINS Group, Inc.AmWINS Group, Inc. is a leading wholesale distributor of specialty insurance products and services with expertise across a diversified mix of property, casualty and group benefits products.
