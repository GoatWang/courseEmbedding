1T. Rowe Price ranked third in the Securities and Asset Management Industry category. The survey started with approximately 1,500 companies: the FORTUNE 1,000® (the 1,000 largest U.S. companies ranked by revenue), plus non-U.S. companies in FORTUNE’s Global 500® database with revenue of $10 billion U.S. dollars or more. The companies were then sorted by industry, and the 15 largest for each international industry and the 10 largest for each U.S. industry were selected. A total of 680 companies from 28 countries were surveyed. To create the 51 industry lists, Hay Group (FORTUNE® survey partner) asked executives, directors, and securities analysts to rate companies in their own industry on 9 criteria, from investment value and quality of management and products to social responsibility and ability to attract talent. A company’s score must rank in the top half of its industry survey to be listed.
