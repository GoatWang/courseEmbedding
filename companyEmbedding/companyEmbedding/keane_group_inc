P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

We offer access to more carriers and more innovative solutions than anyone in the industry.  All lines of insurance for hospitals, senior care facilities, surgery centers, ACOs, large groups, and individual providers.








Keane Advantage

Technology





 
The Keane Insurance Group has been nothing but exceptional.  They have great customer service, answering all questions and handling any situation.  Our consultant, Jeff Hebenstreit, has been nothing but open and honest and annually fighting for the best rates possible.  Both he and the company make us feel like family rather than just a client.



Susie Estrada, Practice Manager

Our professional partnership with the Keane Group is integral to our mission to advance, protect and reward the practice of good medicine. We share a common goal in advocating for physicians, and value the expertise and integrity they bring to their important role in delivering insurance protection to their clients.



Bill Fleming
Chief Operating Officer, The Doctors Company



















Our Story
The Keane Insurance Group began in 1995 as an independent brokerage specializing in medical professional liability insurance for physicians and other healthcare providers.  Focusing completely on healthcare meant that clients were confident they were getting the best service and best coverage in the industry.  Since that time Keane has evolved with the ever-changing healthcare landscape by staying informed about changes and anticipating clients’ needs.
As our reputation for providing creative, alternative insurance solutions grew, opportunities to expand both vertically and horizontally grew as well.  Growth came in the form of new products for large groups, ACOs, hospitals, urgent care and surgery centers, and long term care facilities.  Product offerings were expanded to include free HR assistance, disability insurance plans, coverage for Cyber Liability, and more .  Growth also came in the form of expansion into multiple states as we partnered with more than 50 different medical professional liability insurance companies and added clients across the Nation. 
Strategic innovation, partnerships, and advanced technology led Keane to growth geographically with steady expansion into all 50 states.  Our team of medical professional liability brokers lead the way acting as consultants and advisors to more than 5,000 clients in every type of facility, specialty, and state.
The Keane Insurance Group continues to grow and exceed client expectations  by leveraging size, knowledge, and experience to find the best possible coverage at the best possible prices for all of our clients and partners.






Our Partners
The Keane Insurance Group has established one of the best networks of insurance carriers and partners available in order to provide our physicians, groups, hospitals, and networks the best coverage available to fulfill their unique needs. You can see all of our partners here.













Our Promise
The Keane Group exists to impact and change the world around us for the better.  Our MISSION is to care for people by providing a safe and trusting environment which inspires everyone to flourish as we deliver creative and innovative solutions to the healthcare community.
As a part of our mission, we’ve developed a VISION for the company to realize and celebrate the full potential of all the lives we touch.  This is true for our clients as well as our employees and business partners.
Based on our MISSION and VISION, we have corporate VALUES that we have set as our day-to-day goals:

Always listen to and act in the best interest of all our stakeholders
Maintain the highest level of professionalism in our relationships
Operate with integrity and moral courage in all that we do
Provide an environment for our employees that encourages teamwork, trust, respect and accountability
Promote an environment of continuous improvement, which celebrates strategic thinking, creativity, and innovation
Be proactive to meet the needs of a rapidly changing healthcare environment
Give to, serve with, and support charitable works in our community and around the world













 
I have worked with Ben for several years and he has helped me to save significantly on my professional liability coverage, and has also helped me to ensure that I have sufficient income protection against permanent disability.  Ben and his team at Keane are knowledgeable, highly responsive, and easy to work with.

We will receive net proceeds from the sale of our common stock of approximately
$259.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
approximately $6.0 million of our estimated expenses related to this offering
(or approximately $254.3 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option to purchase additional shares from the selling stockholder
in full).

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholder, including pursuant to any exercise by the underwriters of their
over-allotment option to purchase additional shares of our common stock from the
selling stockholder, but we will be required to pay the underwriting discounts
and commissions associated with such sales of shares. Pursuant to an
over-allotment option, the selling stockholder has offered to sell up to
4,014,000 shares of our common stock in this offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fully repay our existing
balance of approximately $99 million under our Existing Term Loan Facility (and,
in addition, approximately $16 million of prepayment premium related to such
repayment), repay approximately $50 million of our Notes and to pay fees and
expenses related to this offering. We intend to use any remaining proceeds for
general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of indebtedness,
capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic
transactions.

The principal amount outstanding under the Existing Term Loan Facility currently
bears interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to either (a) the base
rate plus 6.00% or (b) LIBOR (subject to a 1.50% floor for any portion of the
term loan subject to an interest period of three or six months) plus 7.00%. The
final maturity date of the Existing Term Loan Facility is the earlier to occur
of (a) March 16, 2021 and (b) to the extent the obligations under the NPA (as
defined herein) mature on or prior to March 16, 2021, the date that is 91 days
prior to the earlier of (i) March 16, 2021 and (ii) the date of the maturity of
the obligations under the NPA. Proceeds from the Existing Term Loan Facility
were used to partially finance the Trican transaction.

The Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 12.00%. The Notes mature on
August 8, 2019. The proceeds from the 2014 issuance of the Notes were used to
refinance existing indebtedness and fund additional investment in hydraulic
fracturing and wireline equipment.

Affiliates of Guggenheim Securities, LLC are holders of the Notes and may
receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering that are used to repay the
Notes.


The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We provide services in
various geographic regions across the United States, and our competitors include
many large and small oilfield service providers, including some of the largest
integrated service companies. Our integrated hydraulic fracturing and wireline
services compete with large, integrated companies such as Halliburton Company,
Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes Incorporated and Weatherford International
plc., as well as other companies such as RPC, Inc., Superior Energy Services,
Inc., C&J Energy Services, Inc., Basic Energy Services, Inc. and FTS
International, Inc. Our hydraulic fracturing services also compete with Calfrac
Well Services Ltd., U.S. Well Services, Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., ProPetro
Services, Inc., Liberty Oilfield Services and Seventy Seven Energy Inc. In
addition, the business segments in which we compete are highly fragmented. We
also compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are
technical expertise, equipment capacity, work force competency, efficiency,
safety record, reputation, experience and price. Additionally, projects are
often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive
environment. While we seek to be competitive in our pricing, we believe many of
our customers elect to work with us based on safety, performance and quality of
our crews, equipment and services. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our
competitors by delivering the highest-quality services and equipment possible,
coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working
environment.


Company Description
We are one of the largest pure-play providers of integrated well completion
services in the U.S., with a focus on complex, technically demanding completion
solutions. Our primary service offerings include horizontal and vertical
fracturing, wireline perforation and logging and engineered solutions,


 as well
as other value-added service offerings. With approximately 944,250 hydraulic
horsepower spread across 23 hydraulic fracturing fleets and 23 wireline trucks
located in the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK
Formation, the Bakken Formation and other active oil and gas basins, we provide
industry-leading completion services with a strict focus on health, safety and
environmental stewardship and cost-effective customer-centric solutions. Our
company prides itself on our outstanding employee culture, our efficiency and
our ability to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and communities
in which we operate.

We provide our services in conjunction with onshore well development, in
addition to stimulation operations on existing wells, to exploration and
production (“E&P”) customers with some of the highest quality and safety
standards in the industry. We believe our proven capabilities enable us to
deliver cost-effective solutions for increasingly complex and technically
demanding well completion requirements, which include longer lateral segments,
higher pressure rates and proppant intensity, and multiple fracturing stages in
challenging high-pressure formations.

As of November 30, 2016, we had 13 hydraulic fracturing fleets and eight
wireline trucks operating in the most active unconventional oil and natural gas
basins in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica
Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation and the Bakken Formation. We are one of the
largest providers of hydraulic fracturing services in the Permian Basin, the
Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale and the Bakken Formation by total hydraulic
horsepower deployed.

Our completion services are designed in partnership with our customers to
enhance both initial production rates and estimated ultimate recovery from new
and existing wells. We seek to deploy our assets with well-capitalized customers
that have long-term development programs that enable us to maximize operational
efficiencies and the return on our assets. We believe our integrated approach
increases efficiencies and provides potential cost savings for our customers,
allowing us to broaden our relationships with existing customers and attract new
ones. In addition, our technical team and engineering center, which is located
in The Woodlands, Texas, provides us the ability to supplement our service
offerings with engineered solutions specifically tailored to address their
completion requirements and challenges.

We believe the demand for our services will increase over the medium and
long-term as a result of a number of favorable industry trends. While drilling
and completion activity has improved along with a rebound in commodity prices
from their lows in early 2016 of $26.21 per barrel (based on the Cushing WTI
Spot Oil Price (“WTI”)) and $1.64 per million British Thermal Units (“mmBtu”) 
for natural gas, we believe there are long-term fundamental demand and supply 
trends that will benefit our company. We believe demand for our services will 
grow from:

• Increases in customer drilling budgets focused in our core service areas;

• Increases in the percentage of rigs that are drilling horizontal wells;

• Increases in the length of the typical horizontal wellbore;

• Increases in the number of fracture stages in a typical horizontal wellbore; 
  and  

• Increases in pad drilling and simultaneous fracturing/wireline operations.

We believe demand and pricing for our services will be further enhanced by a
reduction in available hydraulic fracturing equipment as a result of:

• Cannibalization of parked equipment and increased maintenance costs;

• Aging of existing fleets given the limited investment since the industry   
  downturn in late 2014;  

• Increased customer focus on well-capitalized, safe and efficient service   
  providers that can meet or exceed their requirements; and   

• Reduced access to capital for fleet acquisition, maintenance and deployment.

Pricing levels for our industry’s services are driven primarily by asset
utilization. With the downturn in commodity prices from late 2014 into early
2016, asset utilization across the hydraulic fracturing industry has been
reported at approximately 37%. Of our total 23 hydraulic fracturing fleets,
13 fleets, or 57% of our total fleets, were deployed as of November 30, 2016. We
believe our deployment rate reflects the quality of our assets and services. Due
to lack of investment in maintenance and aging equipment, we believe that
approximately 70% of active industry equipment is currently deployed. We have 15
active hydraulic fracturing fleets, of which 13 fleets, or 87% of our active
fleets, were deployed as of November 30, 2016. Based on current pricing for
component parts and labor, we believe our remaining eight inactive fleets can be
made operational at a cost of approximately $1.5 million per fleet.

Our company was founded in 1973 by the Keane family in Lewis Run, Pennsylvania.
We have been well regarded as a customer-focused operator that prioritizes
safety, the environment and our relationship with the communities in which we
operate. We are committed to maintaining conservative financial policies and a
disciplined approach to asset deployment, adding new capacity with customers
with significant capital budgets and steady development programs rather than on
a speculative basis.

We have developed what we believe is an industry-leading, completions-focused
platform by emphasizing health, safety and environmental stewardship as our
highest priority, implementing an efficient cost structure focused on
disciplined cost controls, establishing a sophisticated supply chain and
investing in state-of-the-art systems, technology and infrastructure to support
our growth. Through these initiatives, our platform has demonstrated the ability
to scale with an increase in activity. For example, in 2013, we organically
entered into the Bakken Formation, where we remain one of the most active
service providers, and, in 2014, we successfully recruited and integrated over
450 employees into our business, resulting in a 74% increase in our employee
base.

We believe that our ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions is a
competitive advantage. We have demonstrated the ability to grow both organically
and through opportunistic acquisitions. From 2010 to 2014, we organically added
seven hydraulic fracturing fleets deployed across the Marcellus Shale/Utica
Shale, the Bakken Formation and the Permian Basin. We have also completed three
acquisitions that have diversified our geographic presence and service line 
capabilities. In April 2013, we acquired the wireline technologies division of 
Calmena Energy Services, which provided us with wireline operations capabilities
in the U.S. In December 2013, we acquired the assets of Ultra Tech Frac Services
to establish a presence in the Permian Basin. In March 2016, we completed the 
opportunistic acquisition of Trican’s U.S. oilfield service operations resulting
in the expansion of our hydraulic fracturing operations to the current 23 fleets
and establishing Keane as one of the largest pure-play providers of integrated 
well completion services in the U.S. with approximately 944,250 hydraulic 
horsepower. This acquisition added high quality equipment, provided increased 
scale in key operating basins, expanded our customer base, and offered 
significant cost reduction opportunities. To date we have identified and 
implemented a plan to achieve over $80 million of annualized cost savings as a 
result of facility consolidations, head count rationalization and procurement 
savings. The Trican transaction also enhanced our access to proprietary 
technology and engineering capabilities that have improved our ability to 
provide integrated services solutions. We intend to continue to evaluate 
potential acquisitions on an opportunistic basis that would complement our 
existing service offerings or expand our geographic capabilities.
