      to middle income households in North America, today announced that Glenn 
      J. Williams has assumed the role of chief executive officer in keeping 
      with the company’s previously announced executive leadership transition 
      plans. Williams, who previously served as the company’s President, is a 
      34-year Primerica veteran and has served in a variety of management and 
      leadership roles during his tenure.
    


      Today also marks the 5th anniversary of Primerica’s

      strategy of growing distribution, increasing earnings, and deploying 
      capital to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders,” said 
      Glenn Williams. “We are currently experiencing solid momentum. In the 
      first quarter we have growth across key distribution metrics versus the 
      first quarter a year ago, including an increase in the size of our life 
      insurance licensed sales force, continued momentum in Investment and 
      Savings Products sales, as well as strong growth in Term Life insurance 
      policies issued. I’m proud of the achievements and dedication of our

      difference in the lives of Main Street families every day. I’m excited 
      about the opportunities that lie ahead for Primerica, and I’m committed

Primerica, Inc. Board Promotes Glenn J. Williams to CEO




R. Williams, Addison Welcome “Ideal Leader” for Succession






January 04, 2015 04:23 PM Eastern Standard Time



DULUTH, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) today announced that its Board of Directors 
      has promoted Glenn J. Williams, currently the company’s President, to 
      Chief Executive Officer and also elected him to the Board, effective 
      April 1, 2015.
    


      The current Co-Chief Executive Officers, D. Richard (Rick) Williams and 
      John A. Addison Jr., will remain members of the Primerica Board. In 
      their new roles, Rick Williams, who has been with Primerica since 1989, 
      will be non-executive Chairman of the Board and John Addison, who has 
      been with the company since 1982, will be non-executive Chairman of 
      Primerica Distribution.
    

      The Board also announced today that it has promoted Peter W. Schneider 
      to the position of President, also effective April 1, 2015.
    

      “Glenn has served as our ‘right hand man’ for the past 10 years and we 
      are confident that he is the ideal leader to take the helm of our 
      company and continue our growth trajectory.” said Rick Williams. “He 
      possesses tremendous depth of understanding of our sales force and for 
      many years has successfully overseen marketing for all Primerica 
      business lines. He has valuable experience running our Canadian 
      operations and leading Primerica’s overall management team, and he has 
      been at the forefront of our most successful initiatives.”
    

      John Addison said, “One of Glenn’s strengths is his close relationship 
      with our sales force leadership and the mutual respect they have for 
      each other. We will remain focused on enhancing the business opportunity 
      for our representatives.” He noted that this change represents an 
      effective execution of Primerica’s well-established management 
      succession plan. “There is no success without successors. We are 
      constantly working to develop our next generation of leaders across the 
      company, and Glenn’s career path demonstrates that our program works,” 
      he said.
    

      “The Primerica Board congratulates and thanks Rick and John for their 
      extraordinary leadership and long list of accomplishments over the last 
      15 years," said P. George Benson, Lead Director and Chairman of the 
      Board's Corporate Governance Committee. "It was through their vision, 
      hard work, and determination that Primerica became a publicly traded 
      company on April 1, 2010. Both now feel that the healthy state of the 
      company makes this the right time to make a leadership transition. The 
      Board worked very closely with Rick and John to identify the perfect 
      successor and is delighted that Glenn will serve as Chief Executive 
      Officer. Glenn's 33-year history with Primerica, his understanding of 
      and commitment to maintaining the company's unique culture, and his 
      exceptional leadership skills make him the ideal person to continue the 
      momentum initiated by Rick and John.”
    

      “I am honored to be selected by the Board to serve as the next CEO 
      following two great leaders like Rick and John, and I’m excited to lead 
      our strong and experienced team of sales force leaders and corporate 
      executives,” said Glenn Williams. “I look forward to building on our 
      successful strategy to grow distribution, increase earnings and deploy 
      capital to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Our 
      strengths include our exceptional sales force of more than 97,000 
      independent business men and women who make a difference in the lives of 
      millions of people every day, along with our dedicated Home Office team. 
      I’m committed to leading our clients, representatives and associates to 
      achieve the success they deserve. Further, I am excited to have Peter 
      Schneider serve as our President. He is a proven leader who is uniquely 
      gifted to work alongside me leading our talented executive team and our 
      sales force as we continue to grow Primerica,” said Glenn Williams.
    

      Rounding out Primerica’s executive group are Alison Rand, who has served 
      as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer since 2000, and Gregory Pitts, 
      a 30-year Primerica veteran who will continue as our Chief Operating 
      Officer. “Our senior leadership team, working closely with our other 
      executives, is one of Primerica’s greatest assets, and we are ready to 
      lead the Company in its next era of growth and opportunity,” said Glenn 
      Williams.
    

      Glenn Williams, age 55, began his career with Primerica in 1981 as a 
      member of the company’s sales force. He joined the Home Office team in 
      1983. In 1985, Williams moved to Canada as part of Primerica’s 
      international expansion team, where he spent 15 years in roles of 
      increasing responsibility. He led Primerica Canada as President and 
      Chief Executive Officer from 1996 to 2000. In 2000, he returned to 
      Primerica’s Duluth, Georgia-based headquarters as Executive Vice 
      President of Field and Product Marketing for international operations. 
      In 2005, Primerica elevated Williams to President of the Company. A 
      native of Stockbridge, GA, Williams is a graduate of Baptist University 
      of America, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Education.
    

      Schneider has served as the Company’s Executive Vice President and 
      General Counsel since June 2000 and as Chief Administrative Officer 
      since 2010, and he will retain his General Counsel duties for the 
      foreseeable future. During his tenure with the Company, Schneider has 
      had responsibility for compliance, government relations, media 
      relations, human resources and initiatives to grow our sales force. 
      Schneider, 58, received his Bachelor of Science in Industrial Relations 
      with Highest Honors in Political Science and his Juris Doctor with 
      Honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Glenn J. Williams Becomes Primerica, Inc. CEO

        Press Release, April 1, 2015
Takes over company leadership during time of “solid momentum” 
Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI), a leading distributor of financial products to middle income households in North America, today announced that Glenn J. Williams has assumed the role of chief executive officer in keeping with the company’s previously announced executive leadership transition plans. Williams, who previously served as the company’s President, is a 34-year Primerica veteran and has served in a variety of management and leadership roles during his tenure.

“I am honored to serve as CEO following two great leaders like John Addison and Rick Williams. Our plan is to continue to execute our proven strategy of growing distribution, increasing earnings, and deploying capital to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders,” said Glenn Williams. “We are currently experiencing solid momentum. In the first quarter we have growth across key distribution metrics versus the first quarter a year ago, including an increase in the size of our life insurance licensed sales force, continued momentum in Investment and Savings Products sales, as well as strong growth in Term Life insurance policies issued. I’m proud of the achievements and dedication of our more than 98,000 life insurance licensed representatives who make a difference in the lives of Main Street families every day. I’m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Primerica, and I’m committed to leading our clients, representatives, and associates to achieve the success they deserve.”

Primerica Promotes Glenn J. Williams To CEO
By Nicole Dunkley
January 6, 2015
 


 
Primerica, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors has promoted Glenn J. Williams, currently the company’s President, to Chief Executive Officer and also elected him to the Board, effective April 1, 2015. 
The current Co-Chief Executive Officers, D. Richard (Rick) Williams and John A. Addison Jr., will remain members of the Primerica Board. In their new roles, Rick Williams, who has been with Primerica since 1989, will be non-executive Chairman of the Board and John Addison, who has been with the company since 1982, will be non-executive Chairman of Primerica Distribution.
The Board also announced that it has promoted Peter W. Schneider to the position of President, also effective April 1, 2015.
“Glenn has served as our ‘right hand man’ for the past 10 years and we are confident that he is the ideal leader to take the helm of our company and continue our growth trajectory.” said Rick Williams. “He possesses tremendous depth of understanding of our sales force and for many years has successfully overseen marketing for all Primerica business lines. He has valuable experience running our Canadian operations and leading Primerica’s overall management team, and he has been at the forefront of our most successful initiatives.”
John Addison said, “One of Glenn’s strengths is his close relationship with our sales force leadership and the mutual respect they have for each other. We will remain focused on enhancing the business opportunity for our representatives.” He noted that this change represents an effective execution of Primerica’s well-established management succession plan. “There is no success without successors. We are constantly working to develop our next generation of leaders across the company, and Glenn’s career path demonstrates that our program works,” he said.
“The Primerica Board congratulates and thanks Rick and John for their extraordinary leadership and long list of accomplishments over the last 15 years," said P. George Benson, Lead Director and Chairman of the Board's Corporate Governance Committee. "It was through their vision, hard work, and determination that Primerica became a publicly traded company on April 1, 2010. Both now feel that the healthy state of the company makes this the right time to make a leadership transition. The Board worked very closely with Rick and John to identify the perfect successor and is delighted that Glenn will serve as Chief Executive Officer. Glenn's 33-year history with Primerica, his understanding of and commitment to maintaining the company's unique culture, and his exceptional leadership skills make him the ideal person to continue the momentum initiated by Rick and John.”
“I am honored to be selected by the Board to serve as the next CEO following two great leaders like Rick and John, and I’m excited to lead our strong and experienced team of sales force leaders and corporate executives,” said Glenn Williams. “I look forward to building on our successful strategy to grow distribution, increase earnings and deploy capital to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Our strengths include our exceptional sales force of more than 97,000 independent business men and women who make a difference in the lives of millions of people every day, along with our dedicated Home Office team. I’m committed to leading our clients, representatives and associates to achieve the success they deserve. Further, I am excited to have Peter Schneider serve as our President. He is a proven leader who is uniquely gifted to work alongside me leading our talented executive team and our sales force as we continue to grow Primerica,” said Glenn Williams.
Rounding out Primerica’s executive group are Alison Rand, who has served as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer since 2000, and Gregory Pitts, a 30-year Primerica veteran who will continue as our Chief Operating Officer. “Our senior leadership team, working closely with our other executives, is one of Primerica’s greatest assets, and we are ready to lead the Company in its next era of growth and opportunity,” said Glenn Williams.
Glenn Williams, age 55, began his career with Primerica in 1981 as a member of the company’s sales force. He joined the Home Office team in 1983. In 1985, Williams moved to Canada as part of Primerica’s international expansion team, where he spent 15 years in roles of increasing responsibility. He led Primerica Canada as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1996 to 2000. In 2000, he returned to Primerica’s Duluth, Georgia-based headquarters as Executive Vice President of Field and Product Marketing for international operations. In 2005, Primerica elevated Williams to President of the Company. A native of Stockbridge, GA, Williams is a graduate of Baptist University of America, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Education.
Schneider has served as the Company’s Executive Vice President and General Counsel since June 2000 and as Chief Administrative Officer since 2010, and he will retain his General Counsel duties for the foreseeable future. During his tenure with the Company, Schneider has had responsibility for compliance, government relations, media relations, human resources and initiatives to grow our sales force. Schneider, 58, received his Bachelor of Science in Industrial Relations with Highest Honors in Political Science and his Juris Doctor with Honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
