Executing On Our Long-Term Strategy
PDC Energy, Inc. ("PDC" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: PDCE) is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid debt metrics while delivering value-added organic growth from a liquids-rich portfolio through horizontal drilling. PDC’s strategy is simple: increase shareholder value through the growth of reserves, production, and per share cash flow and earnings, while focusing on safe and efficient operations, environmental stewardship and community outreach. 
PDC’s primary focus continues to be on developing its approximately 2,150 2P horizontal drilling locations as of year-end 2015 in the Core Wattenberg Field located in Colorado. The Company is also focused on delineating and developing the estimated 710 potential horizontal drilling locations on its approximately 57,000 net acre Delaware Basin acquisition which closed in December 2016. PDC also operates in the condensate and wet gas windows of the Utica Shale play in Ohio. PDC is committed to optimizing margins through efficient drilling operations and sound asset management.

About PDC Energy







					Overview						| Print |


Summary Overview
PDC Energy is an exploration and production company headquartered in Denver, Colorado focused on value-added organic growth through active horizontal drilling programs and bolt-on acquisitions in its core areas. PDC's operations include production, development, exploration and marketing of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”). PDC’s portfolio is comprised of the Wattenberg Field in Colorado, the Delaware Basin in West Texas and the Utica Shale in Ohio. The Company’s total 2016 net production increased approximately 44% year-over-year to 22.2 MMBoe, which was derived primarily from the Wattenberg Field, and consisted of 61% crude oil and NGLs, and 39% natural gas.
As of year-end 2016, the Company had proved reserves of 341 MMBoe and owned an interest in approximately 2,900 gross productive wells. PDC has a very large inventory of predictable, high-value horizontal locations in the Wattenberg Field (approximately 1,800) that offer significant organic development and long-term growth opportunities. Additionally, the Company has identified 785 horizontal locations in the Delaware Basin through its recent acquisitions.
Well-positioned to Deliver Value

2017 Capital budget is focused on its best rate-of-return drilling in the Middle Core area of the Wattenberg Field as well as development of its Delaware Basin assets with a focus on holding leasehold through drilling.
Projected to deliver ~40% production growth to 30.0-33.0 MMBoe in 2017
Projected 2017 year-end Leverage Ratio, as defined by its credit agreement, of approximately 1.7
Strong Liquidity of approximately $950 million as of March 31, 2017
Well hedged with approximately 70% of crude oil and 50% of natural gas volumes hedged in 2017
Operational control and flexibility; nearly 100% of leasehold held-by-production in Wattenberg

Operations








					Overview as of July 10, 2017						| Print |


Growing reserves and production
PDC Energy follows a simple and effective business strategy of value-added growth of reserves and production, while maximizing margins and cash flow and maintaining a strong balance sheet and debt metrics. The Company is focused on horizontal drilling and low-risk organic development of oil and natural gas reserves from shales and tight reservoir rocks.
Geographical diversity
PDC Energy currently operates in three geographically distinct areas of the country, with primary interest in the Wattenberg field and Delaware basins.

Denver - Julesburg Basin

Core Wattenberg Field - Weld County, Colorado


Permian Basin

Delaware Basin - Reeves and Culberson Counties, West Texas


The Company announced in April that it intends to begin marketing for sale its Utica Shale assets in Southeast Ohio.




Emphasis on oil and NGLs
PDC is focused on horizontal Niobrara and Codell development in the liquid-rich Wattenberg Field, where liquid content in new horizontal wells is expected to average 50% - 75% of the production stream. In the Delaware Basin, the Company is targeting the Wolfcamp A, B and C development where it expects the Eastern acreage block to be 70-80% liquids, the Central block 60-70% liquids and the Western block 50-70% liquids.
Drilling and development
Annual production from continuing operations for 2016 averaged 60,590 Boe per day and proved reserves at year-end 2016 totalled 341 MMboe. During 2016, the Company spud 129 gross horizontal wells and participated in 17 non-operated horizontal projects.
Fiscal management and marketing strategy
PDC Energy is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet as part of its fiscal strategy. PDC utilizes an active hedging program for oil and natural gas to reduce the effects of variable commodity prices and help insulate cash flow to help fund its capital expenditure program.

Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
