At age 13, Crane created designs for Tennyson’s poem, “The Lady of Shalott,” that were so impressive, famous engraver William James Linton offered him an apprenticeship. Crane was strongly influenced by Japanese prints, and his innovative illustrations reflect their flat color and bold lines. Although he painted landscapes and portraits, Crane is best known for his illustrations for Spenser, Hawthorne’s “Wonder Book” and Grimm’s “Fairy Tales.” Crane is still recognized today as one of the most important and innovative children’s book illustrators.Read MoreItem# 12362841AReviewsGuarantee & ReturnsBackDetailsReviewsCommentsProduct DetailsThis product is reproduced from a publication, advertisement, or vintage print.
