You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

GEAR RING®

			The patented Gear Ring is made from high quality matte stainless steel. It features micro-precision gears that turn in unison when the outer rims are spun (as can be seen in the video). It is currently available for purchase in sixteen standard US ring sizes: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 & 20.
For sizing, please note that our ring is wider than average. If you are a half size, we recommend ordering the next whole size up (one half size larger).
The Gear Ring sizing is unisex for both men and women.  As general guidance, the average sizes for an adult man are Size 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.  The average ring sizes for an adult woman are Size 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 
For international sizing, please be sure to reference a conversion chart since ring sizes do vary by country. The Gear Ring is based on US/Canadian measurements.
When using our sizing chart, please make sure you follow Steps 1 and 2 carefully.  If these 2 steps are not followed, the sizing chart will print to the wrong scale and you will not be able to acquire the correct size you need. You may need to modify your printer settings and uncheck the “fit to scale” box or set to 100% before printing.
Gift cards for the Gear Ring are available. Please email us for more information.
We gladly offer a full money back guarantee (see FAQ section) if you are unsatisfied with your purchase for any reason.

Gear Ring Information

What material is used in your product?
The Gear Ring is fabricated using 316L, which is the highest quality surgical stainless steel in the jewelry market. Stainless steel has properties which make it highly durable and resistant to tarnishing, fading, scratching, and rusting. It will not bend or break and is hypoallergenic for those with metal allergies.
How do I know which ring size to order?
If you are uncertain of your ring size, please refer to our sizing chart to guide you. It is important to follow the instructions carefully and the sizing chart MUST be printed.  You can not obtain your measurement by viewing the sizing chart on your monitor.  Our rings are available in whole sizes, so if you are a half size, we recommend ordering the next whole size up (one half size larger).  Our sizing chart represents ring sizes for the US and Canada. 

How do I care for my stainless steel Gear Ring?
To care for your Gear Ring, it is recommended to soak it in warm soapy water and wipe dry with a soft cloth. Please be sure to not use any harsh abrasives or household chemicals which may damage its natural protective coat. Please note that certain grainy materials (such as sand) may clog the gears, making the ring difficult to spin, and may be difficult to remove. Do not try to oil or lubricate the ring. Do not try to dismantle or modify the construction of the ring in any manner as this may make it become impossible to repair.  We kindly request that you contact us should the need arise.
			Finally, as with any piece of jewelry, please take caution and do not wear while working with any machinery, equipment or hazardous substances.
Do you offer engraving services for the inside of the Gear Ring?
We are not able to offer engraving services directly. One of the main reasons we do not offer this service is due to errors in sizing.  We gladly offer size exchanges but this would become complicated if rings were engraved prior to making sure the ring fits.  However, we do recommend taking the Gear Ring to a local jeweler once you confirm that you have the size that fits. 
Will the colored rings lose their color over time?
Our colored rings are plated over stainless steel.  Due to the nature of PVD plating, it is normal that over time the plating may wear off.  However, we have made sure to apply a very thick layer of plating to increase the longevity of the color. 
If the color starts wearing away on my colored ring, can I send it back to be re-plated?
Yes, we will be able to re-plate your ring for an additional fee.  Please contact us if needed to learn more.
What is not covered with the Limited Lifetime Warranty?
Due to the nature of PVD plating, we can not replace your colored Gear Ring if the plating wears off over time due to normal wear and tear.  The plating/coating is not included in our warranty. However, if your item becomes damaged or if there seems to be a manufacturer's defect at any time after your purchase, we will gladly exchange your item for a new one. The Limited Lifetime Warranty is automatically part of your original order. Your ring and receipt will be required to process your warranty transaction. The only cost to you is a shipping/handling fee to send the replacement to you. Please contact us so we may quickly process your warranty.
How is my order packaged? May I send it as a gift? Is there gift-wrapping available?
Your Gear Ring will arrive in a Kinekt Design box. You may add a gift tag to any order, free of charge. We are currently unable to offer gift-wrapping service.
The Gear Ring and Gear Necklace are awesome! Will there be any other products by Kinekt Design coming out soon?
Kinekt Design is always striving to bring you new unique products. Please be sure to check back for new announcements on our website. To be sure you don't miss any new product launches, please join our mailing list.










Gear Necklace Information

What material is used in the Gear Necklace?
The Gear Necklace, including the ball chain, clasp, and tag is fabricated out of 316L stainless steel, which is the highest quality stainless steel in the jewelry market. It is light-weight and very comfortable to wear.  To fully appreciate the tactile sensation the Gear Necklace offers, it is encouraged to experience and feel the movement firsthand. 
How do I know what length necklace to order? 
The length options offered (18”, 20”, and 30”) are all the length of the necklace chain.  See our length guide as a reference point to how these different lengths may fit.  Please note this is only a general guidance since the fit will vary from person to person.  The size of the heart pendant will remain the same regardless of the chain length.  
Are there any other lengths offered?
We may be able to make a custom length for you so please email us for more details.
How do I care for my stainless steel Gear Necklace?
To care for your Gear Necklace, it is recommended to soak it in warm soapy water and wipe dry with a soft cloth. 
			Please be sure to not use any harsh abrasives or household chemicals, which may damage its natural protective coat. 
			Please note that certain grainy materials (such as sand) may clog the gears, making the gears difficult to spin, and
			 may be difficult to remove. Do not try to oil or lubricate the necklace.  It is possible to remove the chain if 
			 needed for easier cleaning.  We kindly request that you contact us should the need arise. Finally, as with any piece 
			 of jewelry, please take caution and do not wear while working with any machinery, equipment or hazardous substances.
How easily does hair get caught in the necklace?
The necklace is designed so that the gears and movement are recessed, or set down lower, inside the pendant.   Since the gears do not sit on the top surface of the necklace, it is not easy for hair to get caught.   We understand your concern but we have never found this to be an issue through all our own testing.  As your satisfaction with our product is highly important to us, we will gladly offer you a refund should it not meet your expectations.
Do you offer engraving services for the Gear Necklace?
We are not able to offer engraving services directly.  However, we do recommend that you take the necklace to a local jeweler to provide this service.
How is my Gear Necklace packaged?
Your Gear Necklace will arrive in a custom-designed Kinekt Design box.
May I send it as a gift?  Can I include a gift message? Is there gift-wrapping available?
Yes, you may send the Gear Necklace as a gift.  If you do not want us to include a packing slip with your order, 
			please send a “note to seller” during the checkout process so we know not to include it.   You may include a gift 
			message during the checkout process and we will include your note written on a gift card.  No, we are currently 
			unable to offer gift-wrapping service at this time.
How do I receive my lifetime warranty?
Your lifetime warranty comes automatically when you make your purchase.  You do not need to do anything further.  
			If anything should arise, please just email us and let us know.  You will only have to provide the original buyer 
			information so we can verify the purchase in our system.
How do I get a rebate on my Gear Necklace purchase?  Is it possible to get a rebate if I did not purchase a Gear Ring? 
We are only offering the Gear Necklace rebate to those who have already purchased a Gear Ring as a special reward to our current customers.  This rebate does NOT apply to the Gear Necklace Mini. Please note that we do offer the Kinekt Set (the Gear Ring and Gear Necklace) together at a discounted special price.  If you have purchased a Gear Ring, and want a rebate on the Gear Necklace, please fill out the Mail-In Rebate Form.  Follow the instructions carefully on the form in order to avoid any delays.
