Managers in accordance with Section 3(a), the Company will
pay, or will cause to be paid, to the Managers, in advance of the
relevant fiscal year, an annual non-refundable advisory fee (the
“ Advisory Fee ”) equal to $6,000,000,
unless such other amount as may be mutually agreed upon between
BMP, on the one
 
-3-


hand, and the Company’s Board of
Directors, on the other hand; provided , that any such
mutually agreed upon amount shall not exceed two percent
(2%) of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit
Agreement among Intermediate Holdings, Emdeon, the other Borrowers
from time to time party thereto. Bank of America, N.A., as the
Administrative Agent, the other agents listed therein and each
lender from time to time party thereto, dated as of
November 2, 2011 for such fiscal year (such amount to be paid,
the “ EBITDA Amount ”); provided ,
further , that subject to Section 4(c), if mutually
agreed by BMP, on the one hand, and the Company’s Board of
Directors, on the other hand, that the Advisory Fee be based on the
EBITDA Amount, then the amount of the Advisory Fee shall be paid
based on the Company’s then most current estimate of the
projected EBITDA Amount for the fiscal year immediately preceding
the date upon which the Advisory Fee is paid. The Advisory Fee
shall be divided among the Managers, and paid by the Company to
each of the Managers simultaneously, on the Agreed Upon
Basis.

(b) The Advisory Fee for the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending December 31, 2011
shall be paid on the closing of the Merger in respect of Services
to be rendered during such period, and shall be a prorated amount
based on the number of days from and after, but including, the date
of this Agreement until, and including, December 31, 2011 and
assuming a 365-day year. Thereafter, the Advisory Fee for each
subsequent 12-month period shall be paid in advance on the first
business day of January in each year, beginning on January 3,
2012.

(c) Following the receipt of audited
financial statements for the immediately preceding fiscal year, the
Company shall recalculate the EBITDA Amount and, only if previously
mutually agreed by both the Managers, on the one hand, and the
Company’s Board of Directors, on the other hand, that the
Advisory Fee be based on the EBITDA Amount, the Advisory Fee, in
each case, for the current fiscal year on the basis of such audited
financial statements. If it had been previously agreed by both the
Managers, on the one hand, and the Company’s Board of
Directors, on the other hand, that the Advisory Fee be based on the
EBITDA Amount, then, based on the recalculation described in the
immediately preceding sentence, (A) if the recalculated
Advisory Fee is greater than the Advisory Fee previously paid by
the Company to the Managers in respect of such current fiscal year,
then the Company shall simultaneously pay to each Manager such
Manager’s share of the difference between such amounts and
(B) if the recalculated Advisory Fee is less than the Advisory
Fee previously paid by the Company to the Managers in respect of
such current fiscal year, then each Manager shall pay to the
Company such Manager’s share of the difference between such
recalculated Advisory Fee and the Advisory Fee paid by the Company
in respect of such current fiscal year. Any payment required by the
preceding sentence shall be paid by the Company or the Managers, as
applicable, no later than two business days following the
determination of the amount of such payment.

(d) To the extent the Company cannot
pay, or cause to be paid, the Advisory Fee for any reason,
including by reason of any prohibition on such payment pursuant to
any applicable law or the terms of any debt financing of the
Company or its subsidiaries, the payment by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to the Managers of the accrued and payable
Advisory Fee will be deferred and will be payable immediately on
the earlier of (i) the first date on which the payment of such
deferred Advisory Fee is no longer prohibited under any contract
applicable to the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries, as
applicable, is otherwise able to make
 
-4-


such payment, or cause such payment to be made
and (ii) the total or partial liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, under any applicable law or under any contract applicable
to the Company or its subsidiaries, any forbearance of collection
of the Advisory Fee by the Managers shall not be deemed to be a
subordination of such payments to any other person, entity or
creditor of the Company or its subsidiaries. Any such forbearance
shall be at each Manager’s sole option and discretion and
shall in no way impair such Manager’s right to collect such
payments. Any installment of the Advisory Fee not paid on the
scheduled due date will bear interest, payable in cash when the
underlying installment is paid, at an annual rate of 10%,
compounded quarterly, from the date due until paid. The Company
shall pay the amounts underlying any unpaid portion of the Advisory
Fee (including any accrued interest thereon) to the Managers
simultaneously on the Agreed Upon Basis as, and to the extent,
sufficient funds become available to the Company.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, BMP may elect, in its sole
discretion by notice to the Company, at any time at or after a
change of control of the Company, a sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company or an initial public offering of
the equity of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or its or their
successors or any direct or indirect parent entity of the Company
(or at any time thereafter) (a “ Trigger Event
”) for each Manager to receive, in consideration of such
Manager’s role in facilitating the same and in settlement of
the termination of the Services, (i) any remaining accrued and
unpaid Advisory Fees (including interest, if any, payable by the
Company under this Agreement) and (ii) in addition to any fees
owing to such Manager in connection with such transaction pursuant
to Section 3(b) hereof, a single lump sum non-refundable cash
payment (the “ Lump Sum Fee ”) equal to
the then present value (using a discount rate equal to the yield to
maturity on the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding the date the Lump Sum Fee is payable of the class of
outstanding U.S. government bonds having a final maturity closest
to the assumed Termination Date described below (the “
Discount Rate ”)) of such Manager’s share
of all then current and future Advisory Fees payable to such
Manager under this Agreement, assuming the Termination Date is the
twelfth anniversary of the date of such election and assuming that
the EBITDA Amount continues to grow at a rate that is the higher of
(x) an assumed 5% growth rate and (y) the
“organic” ( i.e ., not attributable to any
acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions) growth
rate for the 12-month period ended as of the date of such election
by BMP, in each case during the successive 12-month periods ending
prior to the payment of such Lump Sum Fee. Promptly after the
receipt of such written notice the Company shall pay such
Manager’s share of the Lump Sum Fee and any accrued and
unpaid Advisory Fees (including any applicable interest) to such
Manager by wire transfer in same-day funds to the bank account or
accounts designated by such Manager, which payment shall not be
refundable under any circumstances. Upon the giving of such notice,
the obligation of such Manager to provide the Services hereunder,
and the obligations of the Company to pay Advisory Fees with
respect to future periods (except as provided above), will be
terminated, but all other provisions of this Agreement will
continue unaffected.

(f) To the extent the Company does
not pay, or cause to be paid, any portion of the Lump Sum Fee by
reason of any prohibition on such payment pursuant to any
applicable law, the terms of any agreement or indenture governing
indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries, any unpaid portion
of the Lump Sum Fee shall be paid to each electing Manager
immediately on the earlier of (i) the first date on which the
payment of such unpaid amount is no
 
-5-


longer prohibited under any such agreement or
indenture applicable to the Company and the Company or its
subsidiaries, as applicable, is otherwise able to make such
payment, or cause such payment to be made and (ii) the total
or partial liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, under any
applicable law or under any contract applicable to the Company or
its subsidiaries, any forbearance of collection of the Lump Sum Fee
by an electing Manager shall not be deemed to be a subordination of
such payments to any other person, entity or creditor of the
Company or its subsidiaries. Any such forbearance shall be at such
Manager’s sole option and discretion and shall in no way
impair such Manager’s right to collect such payments. Any
portion of the Lump Sum Fee not paid on the scheduled due date
shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to 10% per annum,
compounded quarterly, from the date due until paid. The Company
shall pay the amounts underlying any unpaid portion of the Lump Sum
Fee (including any accrued interest thereon) to the Managers
simultaneously on the Agreed Upon Basis as, and to the extent,
sufficient funds become available to the Company

A fee agreement is a contract used by attorneys and other professionals to establish the price for services rendered for their clients. An agreement may stipulate a flat fee, a fee paid hourly, or a fee contingent on certain conditions.

The document often includes an anticipated timetable for the professional's delivery of services or work to the client. A flat fee agreement will stipulate whether the total fee is paid up front or by installment payments. If the agreement is for an hourly fee, the agreement may address the rate and billing increments. Contingency fee agreements outline conditions that must be met in order for the professional to receive payment.

The agreement may contain clauses regarding how possible expenses and costs will be billed. A professional or lawyer's incurred expenses may include travel, mileage, materials, filing fees, and other charges. The document helps both parties understand each side's expectations, and reduces the chance of arguments over monetary issues once the product or service is delivered.
