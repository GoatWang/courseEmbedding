We’ve had the privilege to work with some awesome clients



"Sometimes, and in numerous ways, companies find a way to succeed. Such is our partnership with MyersCox. Hartig Drug Stores relied on the Capital Tobacco Company to manufacture a "Quality Cigar for a nickel" in 1904. Some 107 years later, we continue to rely on our trusted supply channel for many departmental needs. It's all about family, consistency of product, timely delivery…but most of all, trust. I simply believe that they care about Hartig Drug Stores, our success and theirs."− Richard J. Hartig, CEO, Hartig Drug Company



  




Founders
Myers-Cox Company was originally founded in Dubuque in 1866 by Mr. Myers and Mr. Tice. Myers and Tice originally founded the company to manufacture and sell hand-rolled cigars. The tobacco was primarily purchased from Wisconsin farmers and transported to Dubuque by way of train or boat. The company manufactured hand-rolled cigars and sold them to retailers in the area. In the early 1890’s W.G. Cox purchased Tice’s interest in the company and the name changed to what it is today, Myers-Cox Company.
In the early 1900’s Myers-Cox started distributing some nationally branded cigars. Territory franchises were established and became an important piece of the distribution process. W.B. Poinsett joined Myers-Cox in 1926 as sales manager. Poinsett and Thomas Stampfer, the owner of a large Dubuque department store, purchased the company is 1931. The company moved its headquarters and warehouse to Dodge and Main Streets in 1935. William Poinsett, W.B.’s son, joined Myers-Cox in 1939 and eventually took over management in the 1950’s.








History
World War II brought a lot of challenges for the country and consequentially, Myers-Cox. All resale products were rationed, including gasoline and tires. The rationing made delivering product and making sales calls challenging. As men answered the call to serve the country, women joined the warehouse operation at Myers-Cox for the first time. Joseph A. Carew joined the Myers-Cox team in August of 1955. This started his fifty-three year long career with Myers-Cox.
Joseph A. Carew joined the Myers-Cox team in August of 1955. This started his fifty-three year long career with Myers-Cox. Throughout the years Carew family members have always been involved in the company, working in every department. The second generation of the Carew family remains an integral part of the company. Greg’s wife, Mary Carew, is currently the Chief Financial Officer. Chris Dempsey, Greg and Mary’s son-in-law, joined the business in 2009. Chris’ addition brings the third generation of the family into the business and continues the valuable tradition of family involvement in the Myers-Cox Company.

Present Day
Over the years, product variety has expanded, transportation methods have improved, and the location of Myers-Cox has changed. The goal of the company has remained consistent: Myers-Cox takes care of its customers. Myers-Cox understands what it takes for a small business to succeed. It has succeeded as a family owned business for generations and will continue that tradition by using its expertise to help its customers grow their own businesses for generations.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
