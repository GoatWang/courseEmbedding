Long-Term Outperformance Through a Risk-Controlled Process






  Fixed Income
 Our fixed income strategies seek to produce excess returns net of fees relative to client benchmarks. Portfolio managers identify the desired sector exposure and portfolio duration of each portfolio. Using these parameters, we seek to maximize total return by taking advantage of economic fundamentals and market conditions. more 

Liquidity
The goal of our Liquidity Products is to obtain a high level of current income consistent with capital preservation and liquidity over the short term. These strategies identify the desired weighted-average maturity of each portfolio and use fundamentals and market conditions to maximize current income. more

Equity
The Small Cap Value, Midcap Value, and SMID (Small/Mid) Cap Value strategies reflect our belief that attractive returns can be achieved over a full market cycle within the small and mid- capitalization universes by combining a systematic quantitative approach with traditional fundamental analysis. The Equity Investment Team manages the client portfolios utilizing a clearly defined, highly disciplined process. Our investment process is designed to create diversified portfolios of equity securities with attractive valuations that also exhibit positive earnings trends. Our emphasis is on creating stable portfolios with modest turnover. more

Smith Graham & Co. Investment Advisors has doubled its assets under management to nearly $6 billion by purchasing most of the assets of Ark Asset Management Co. of New York.
Terms of the deal, which closes today, were not released.
Before the acquisition, Smith Graham managed about $2.8 billion in fixed-income assets for institutional clients worldwide, including the pension funds for Continental Airlines, Exxon Mobil Corp. and the city of Houston.



With that book of business, Smith Graham earned the No. 8 spot on Black Enterprise Magazine’s 2008 annual ranking of the nation’s African-American-owned asset management firms.
By purchasing Ark’s fixed-income and most of its value-equity business portfolio, Smith Graham expands its product offerings and adds 15 people to its staff of 15, for a total of 30 employees.
About 90 percent of Ark’s clients have agreed to transfer their accounts to the Houston-based Smith Graham, the company said in a news release. Those institutional investors include the state of Wyoming, New York State Common Fund and the pension funds of several labor unions.

“This is truly transformational for our company,” Gerald Smith, chairman and chief executive officer of Smith Graham & Co., said in a phone interview while completing the details of the deal in New York.
“Our competition is no longer just minority-owned firms,” he said. “In order to effectively compete, we had to have size and scale. With offices in Houston and New York, I will put us up against anyone.”
Smith Graham opens its New York office at 140 Broadway on Monday.

Real Talk with Brian Tortorella of Smith Graham 
Jul 21 2017  |  11:16am ET

This morning, we sit down with Brian Tortorella of Smith Graham to discuss the state of the alternatives industry.
Brian is the Head of Mortgage & Real Estate Debt Alternatives (MRE) and has over 20 years of experience in the investment industry. In his role, Brian is responsible for the management and oversight of the New York Mortgage & Real Estate investment team as well as the strategic vision of the business. Prior to joining Smith Graham, Brian started and ran the Residential Mortgage group at Five Mile Capital Partners where he spent more than nine years responsible for raising, investing and managing over $800 million of equity through funds and separate accounts with residential mortgage exclusive strategies.

FINalternatives: What is your feeling on the state of the alternatives industry, right now?
Brian Tortorella: Given a low interest rate environment, investors are looking to alternatives as a solution. However, alternatives can take many forms and offer yields that vary on a risk-return basis.  Our bridge loan product is an alternative investment that offers attractive risk-adjusted yields for investors. It focuses on short term loans which finance investors of single family homes and provides investors with: current income, short duration, low volatility,  a high degree of control, and accretive optionality.  These attributes, coupled with the fact that the MRE team has significant years of experience (17 years plus on average for senior members) make bridge loans an attractive opportunity where Smith Graham is well positioned.
What have your returns been compared to your benchmarks?  
Our space does not necessarily have standard benchmarks, per say. However, the MRE team has an exemplary $900 million track record that has been built over the past 9 years in both the residential whole loan and bridge loan sectors. Our team has been first movers in both spaces and thus has been able to produce yields that have consistently met or exceeded investor’s expectations.
Your site states “The goal of our Liquidity Products is to obtain a high level of current income consistent with capital preservation and liquidity over the short term.” How does this strategy work?
On the site, this is referencing Smith Graham’s liquidity products, and not solely our Bridge Loan product. With regard to bridge loans Smith Graham partners with local originators who finance investors requiring financing alternatives for single family residential housing and smaller multi-family transactions.
The loans purchased are each vetted through a very detailed process which targets cash flows, short duration loans with a significant amount of equity protection. The assets are self-amortizing in nature and thus provide good short-term liquidity in addition to the monthly cash flow received.
What are the barriers to entry in your market?
Our market is not a “plug and play” market. Dealing with local lenders and smaller sized assets takes a sophisticated investment team with deep experience rooted in whole loans.
Housing the assets, holding lenders and servicers accountable, managing collateral, and asset managing the loans are all key drivers to the strategy which cannot be developed overnight.
What makes your opportunity unique?
In the fixed income alternatives space, Smith Graham focuses on markets that are fragmented in nature whereby we can add value to businesses and industries that are not the standard prototypes for fixed income institutions.
In this way, through a very granular approach, we can put the time into becoming true partners with our lenders and growing the business together in a methodical nature. As such, Smith Graham has created a platform that is looked upon as the “best in class” secondary market player when it comes to partnering with local SFR lenders in the bridge loan space.
This has created a unique opportunity to partake in homogeneous assets that have created steady supply for the foreseeable future.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.
