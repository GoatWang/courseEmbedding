Mr. Fogliato combines his interest in sports with his extensive business background



PETIT-LANCY, SWITZERLAND, April 22, 2014, Franco Fogliato, Senior Vice President and General Manager EMEA for Columbia Sportswear, has been named a Worldwide Branding Executive of the Year in Retail Sporting Goods. While inclusion in Worldwide Branding is an honor, only a small selection of members in each discipline are chosen for this distinction. These special honorees are distinguished based on their professional accomplishments, academic achievements, leadership abilities, years of service, and the credentials they have provided in association with their Worldwide Branding membership. 
Mr. Fogliato has 17 years of professional experience in the sportswear industry. He is Senior Vice President and General Manager EMEA for Columbia Sportswear. Throughout his career, he has built up his skill set considerably, becoming an expert in forecasting, brand management, sales, marketing and product omnichannel distribution. On a daily basis, he is responsible for running the European subsidiary of the company, as well as managing profit and loss, and balance sheets of the Columbia Sportswear Group of brands in Europe. Mr. Fogliato reports to the company’s president and CEO. 
Mr. Fogliato was the chief executive officer of Europe for GSM Europe, a subsidiary of the Billabong Group, from 2004 until 2013. In this role, he was responsible for running the European subsidiary. He was managing profit and loss, and balance sheets and reporting to the international chief executive officer. 
Looking back, Mr. Fogliato attributes his success to enjoying the environment he works in; he has always been involved in brand management and omni-channel distribution. He became involved in his profession because he has always been interested in sports and possesses a strong, extensive background in business. 
Mr. Fogliato received an MBA in general management from Open University Business School, U.K. in 2012. In years to come, Mr. Fogliato is committed to continuing to focus on growing businesses within the sportswear market. He is also passionate about continuing to explore his love of sports while creating shareholder value in an industry that is showing long-term market and industry growth.
