Paulson & Co., Inc.

                                    Paulson & Co.'s investment strategies are all based on the same underlying investment philosophy of capital preservation and low correlation to the broad markets. The firm specializes in global merger and event arbitrage, as well as financial restructuring, real estate and credit opportunities involving a range of financial instruments, including equity and debt securities, currencies, commodities, fixed income products, MBS and other derivative securities. Paulson's products are provided through collective investment vehicles, including both domestic partnerships and offshore private investment companies, and separately managed accounts that deploy all or a subset of the firm's investment strategies.The Paulson Funds' investment objective is to achieve positive excess returns through trading the securities and/or derivatives thereon of companies that are the subject of proposed changes in corporate structure or control such as tender offers, mergers, spin-offs, proxy contests, liquidations, recapitalizations, restructurings and bankruptcy reorganizations. Paulson's objective is to purchase these securities and/or derivatives at a discount to what they believe will be their value on the consummation of the proposed event. A complementary objective is to minimize exposure to the general securities markets by concentrating the portfolio on event-specific investments which act independently of the markets. In addition, some of the funds seek to achieve their objective through trading the securities and/or derivatives of companies that are the subject of special situations such as spin-offs, litigation, relative value, restructurings, proxy contests, and post-bankruptcy equities, as well as distressed securities and credit related securities and derivatives, gold and gold related securities and/or derivatives, and direct real estate and real estate related securities.

Both strategies emphasize liquidity and diversification.Kingdon's long/short equity strategy seeks to maximize risk-adjusted total return. Emphasis is placed on both bottom-up individual security selection and general top-down economic analysis. The firm utilizes an internally developed asset allocation model encompassing economic, technical and valuation factors to allocate each fund's assets among various investments. Each fund invests primarily in common stocks and bonds. Investment selection criteria include valuation (both asset- and earnings-based), earnings momentum and relative price momentum. Balance sheet strength and market liquidity are also considered. In addition, certain securities are evaluated through a system of targets and stop losses. Active management of a significant portion of each fund's portfolio may be emphasized, with a sensitivity to short-term market trends and price changes in individual securities. Each fund may sell securities short and employ leverage when such action is deemed appropriate.Kingdon's long/short credit strategy seeks to deliver absolute returns from a diversified portfolio of credit investments, with relatively low volatility. Such holdings may include corporate bonds, loans, credit default swaps, credit indices, distressed, high-yield, bankruptcy claims and convertible securities. The strategy uses leverage and engages in short sales. The strategy combines a solid macro framework and fundamental analysis with the credit execution and risk management experience of Kingdon's investment professionals.

Patients shape our business. They influence our drugmaking process, helping us to understand and address their unmet medical needs, whether we’re creating a new medicine or tackling the equally challenging task of delivering that medicine to people around the world.

Our employees shape our success. Since our founding in 1998, each of our employees has held shares in the company. Being owners of Ironwood means we are all careful stewards of our resources: we take a data-driven approach in which we celebrate definitive answers – whether those answers support holding steady or changing course – and we challenge every program to earn its way forward.

Our discovery and development processes have generated a product that’s approved in the United States and in the European Union, as well as a robust pipeline. As we continue to do drugmaking well, we hope to inspire the support of our shareholders and earn the right to do it again – building an enduring pharmaceutical company that understands and addresses people’s needs.

Trulance™ (Plecanatide)







Trulance™ (Plecanatide)
Trulance is a once-daily tablet approved for adults with CIC and is being evaluated for IBS-C. With the exception of a single amino acid, Trulance is structurally related to uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human GI peptide. Uroguanylin is thought to act in a pH-sensitive manner, targeting GC-C receptors primarily in the small intestine coinciding with areas of fluid secretion.
Trulance has a boxed warning concerning the risk of serious dehydration in pediatric patients. Trulance is contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age; in nonclinical studies in young juvenile mice administration of a single oral dose of plecanatide caused deaths due to dehydration. Use of Trulance should be avoided in patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age. The safety and efficacy of Trulance™ have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.
