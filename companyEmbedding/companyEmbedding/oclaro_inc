Company Fact Sheet

 


Our Company

Oclaro, Inc. (Nasdaq: OCLR), is a leader in optical components, modules, and subsystems for optical transport and metro networks, enterprise networks, and data centers. Leveraging more than three decades of innovation in laser technology, photonic integration, and transceiver/subsystem design, Oclaro’s solutions are at the heart of the fast optical networks and high-speed interconnects that are enabling the next wave of streaming video, cloud computing, voice over IP and other high-speed and bandwidth-intensive applications.
Market Focus
Demand for bandwidth and low latency in the core network continues to explode, with video services, cloud computing, voice over IP and social media driving more network traffic. The telecommunications market has started to expand beyond the small number of very large equipment providers (OEMs), and is now migrating to captive networks, created solely for in-house use by large video services, search engine and cloud computing companies. In addition, the changing needs of the internet are driving an evolution in network topologies. This evolution, combined with the dramatic increase in the need for bandwidth and reduced latency, has created opportunities for new optical technologies and component innovations. At Oclaro, we are investing our R&D where our technology innovation delivers real value and differentiation for the customers we serve. With our heritage of optical innovation we are leading in the very high speed segments of the optical communications market at 40G and above. These solutions are targeted at three distinct, large and growing markets:
Telecom Optical Networks
The core optical network is at the heart of the Internet highway that provides the bandwidth, speed, reach and flexibility to run new and exciting applications such streaming video, social media, cloud computing and voice over IP. We are a leading supplier of optical products at the component, transceiver, and module level, including tunable lasers, receivers, and modulators, that are needed for high-speed transmission, and we are leading the fastest growing 100G segment.
Enterprise Networks and Data Centers
Enterprises and data centers have grown in complexity as they manage the rapidly escalating demands for increased bandwidth and diverse types of data driven through the consumerization of IT and the transition to SaaS services. These next generation architectures, such as hyperscale data centers, require very high speed interconnects to support intensive data traffic within and between corporate datacenters. We are a leading supplier of client-side and short reach optical transceivers at 10G, 40G, 100G and, in some cases, less than 10G, into data communications and enterprise solutions.
Product Portfolio
Our products leverage photonics technologies to transmit, amplify, regenerate and receive data across fiber optic networks. These products enable our telecommunications and data communications customers to increase network bandwidth, reduce latency, and offer new services to their customers flexibly and cost effectively. At a high level, our products include:

Tunable and fixed lasers and transmitters
Lithium niobate modulators
Receivers
Transceivers
Coherent pluggable modules

Worldwide Support and Manufacturing Strength
To provide strong and localized customer support across the globe, we maintain R&D and product/sales support in Europe, Japan, the U.S. and China. Our worldwide manufacturing operations leverage innovation and vertical integration to provide customers with flexibility and faster time to market. We combine in-house and outsourced manufacturing to maximize flexibility and customer support. We operate R&D and chip fabrication facilities in the U.S., U.K., Italy, and Japan; in-house and contract manufacturing sites in China, Malaysia and Thailand; and design, sales and service organizations in each of the major regions around the world.

Oclaro Is Undervalued - Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Oclaro Is UndervaluedJul. 7.17 | About: Oclaro, Inc. (OCLR) Shareholders Unite Small-cap, macro, value, momentumShareholdersuniteSummaryAnother optical network company with some transitory headwinds.The shares are cheap, margins and the balance sheet are very solid.Most of the headwinds from product migration should be behind us, leveraging any upturn in demand.One of the sectors in the optical network industry that still has solid growth is the datacenter business, where the big cloud companies are constantly adding and upgrading. We know this from several other companies we're following in the sector, like Finisar (FNSR) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI). The big boost, apart from the growth in the sector itself, is from upgrading towards 100G and 400G products Here is what the management of Finisar had to say (from Q4CC): sales of 100 gig QSFP transceivers for datacom applications increased over 30% compared to the prior quarter, however, this increase was more than offset by lower demand for other datacom products primarily 10 gig and below shortwave transceivers. More specifically, demand for their QSFP28 Transceiver is still running ahead of supply and they don't expect the two to equate until well into 2018. So a simplifying take-away from this is that demand is booming for higher end datacom products (100G+), but tapering off pretty steeply for lower end products (below 100G). It is therefore good to know that 100G+ happens to be Oclaro's (OCLR) main source of revenue, from the Q3CC: Our results reflect the continuing strength of our 100-gig and beyond product portfolio, which grew to $126 million in sales and represented 78% of our total revenue for the quarter. This growth was fueled by shipments of our market leading CFP2-ACO and our emerging QSFP28 product family into the metro and data center markets. Product transitions Like every optical networker, there are newer products for faster networks that are selling very well, and generally carrying higher margins, but there are also legacy products for which demand is shrinking. For Oclaro for instance: Sales of our 40-gig and below products were down by 9% or $4 million sequentially. This resulted from the expected reduction of legacy 10-gig product shipments.
 In fact, Q4 guidance contains three reasons for softness, two of which are related to product transitions, from the Q3CC:  So we had $36 million of 10 gig, 40 gig business in Q3. Greg’s comment is that we come down between 20% and 25% in the quarter, call at $7 million to $9 million. The next piece is the product transition on the client side from CFP family to QSFP28. Greg indicated we would be down 20% and I will come back to that. And those were the two major downsides on the quarter.  However, given the relative proportions, this isn't terribly worrying. There is compensation, just as with Finisar, demand for their QSFP28 is expanding rapidly, from the Q3CC: This transition is driving the demand for QSFP28 LR4, where we are well positioned and ramping our capacity. We currently expect our QSFP28 sales to double in Q4 and continue to grow throughout this calendar year. Oclaro hasn't been a big player in the data center market but they're catching up as sales of QSFP28 are going to double in the quarter. The third reason for a soft June quarter is familiar territory.. China The familiar bogeyman for the optical networkers (with the exception of Applied Opto), and Oclaro is no exception. Demand from China already declined 9% sequentially in Q3 and constituted 36% of sales (down from 42% in Q2), but worse is to come (from the Q3CC, our emphasis). In April, we were informed by both of our major Chinese customers that demand would be even slower than previously anticipated for Q4. While both customers have signaled a slowdown for demand in the China market, the majority of the projected Q4 impact is coming from one customer. This customer cited both the reduction in demand for the Chinese market as well as in inventory correction. This correction appears to be due in part to the corporate mandate for better cash flow.  The pleasant thing about inventory corrections is that they are finite. The company beliefs that the fundamental demand drivers in China remain in place, more especially from building metro and provincial networks, followed in 2019 by the build out of 5G networks. For the latter, Oclaro argues it's well positioned:
 5G will require extensive 100G plus coherent networks as well as new higher speed back-haul and front-haul connection. In addition to the higher speeds, these networks will require the transceivers to operate over industrial temperature ranges because they will be held outdoors in uncontrolled environments. At OFC this year, we announced the availability of our industrial temperature 25G and tunable transceivers for this very application. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to be successful in this new very large emerging market. The company has become less reliant on China and has diversified its customer base, especially in their ACO (analog coherent optical modules) business, parts of which remain supply constrained. Guidance For the fourth quarter  Revenues in the range of $144M to $152M. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 38% to 41%. Non-GAAP operating income in the range of $27 million to $31 million.  Management expects growth to return in the September quarter based on the growth in the metro and data center markets (outside China) and as a result, they (from Q3CC): project that our sales for calendar year 2017 will grow by approximately 20% compared to 2016. With revenue at this level, we believe that we will be able to maintain our gross margins in the upper 30s to 40% range. This gross margin, when coupled with about 18% to 20% operating expenses, should leave us with a sustainable non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales in the high teens to low-20s. Valuation Financially the company is strong, in no particular order:  The company produces record gross margins of 41.2% (GAAP, up from 26.7% a year ago) and 41.6% (non-GAAP, up from 27.2% a year ago) It's balance sheet is very sound, the company has no debt and a cash holding of $254.8M, an increase of $11.3M over the quarter and really up a lot from the $96M a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $45.5M on revenue of $162M, that's 28%.  If we look at GAAP margins there is a clear and pretty impressive trend the last five years
 

OCLR Gross Profit Margin (NYSE:TTM) data by YCharts If we look trailing p/e and EV/EBITDA, we see that despite a good run in the shares, valuation has steadily declined: 

OCLR PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts Comparing price/sales with a number of competitors, Oclaro is in the mid range with Fabrinet (FN) an outlier. 

OCLR PS Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts Comparing EV/EBITDA also shows it's relatively cheap, although not alone in the sector: 

 The one dissonant in this picture is analyst expectations. On average, they expect 76 cent per share for this (fiscal) year but a slight fall to 74 cent per share for fiscal 2018. That seems to indicate no China recovery for five quarters and/or tapering off for the ACO and/or DCI markets. It's possible that the tailwind from the red hot QSFP28 demand will subside and pricing power decreases somewhat, but on the other hand there seems to be declining room for tailwinds from product migration, given that 100G+ already constitutes some three-quarters of revenues.
 So we are inclined to say this is too pessimistic, and the company in fact has a history of beating expectations: 

 Conclusion The company is a very solid performer basking in some of the highest margins in the business and a very clean balance sheet. While guidance for the quarter has come out weak due to the China slowdown and another transitory element, margins will be roughly maintained at their high levels and the shares are very reasonably priced. We would say a tad too reasonably, the share price seems to factor in a prolonged China slowdown. While this is possible, we have to stress that the demand for their 100G+ products remains solid and this constitutes three-quarters of their revenue, limiting further tailwinds from product migration. They also have the annual price negotiation behind and the damage from that has been rather limited. Management argued during the CC that it wasn't in the habit of renegotiating contracts.

Oclaro Announces Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results
Revenue Up 64 Percent from Q2 FY16; Forecast to Increase Sequentially Again in the March Quarter


SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Oclaro, Inc. (Nasdaq: OCLR), a leading provider and innovator of optical communications solutions, today announced the financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2017, which ended December 31, 2016. 
"Our December quarter was very strong with improvement in all our financial metrics. Revenue increased 14 percent from the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and 64 percent from the same quarter last year, with demand for our newer 100G and beyond products driving this excellent growth. In addition, we had record gross margin and operating income resulting from higher revenue, a richer product mix, and favorable foreign exchange rates," said Greg Dougherty, Chief Executive Officer, Oclaro. "We currently forecast revenue to increase again in the March quarter, driven by healthy demand across the multiple markets we serve."
Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2017

Revenues were $153.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and compare with revenues of $135.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and revenues of $94.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
GAAP gross margin was 39.5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with GAAP gross margin of 34.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and GAAP gross margin of 28.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 39.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with non-GAAP gross margin of 34.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and non-GAAP gross margin of 28.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
GAAP operating income was $33.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This compares with GAAP operating income of $17.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and GAAP operating income of $2.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $36.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with non-GAAP operating income of $20.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and non-GAAP operating income of $5.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $30.3 million. This compares with GAAP net income of $3.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and GAAP net income of $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $36.3 million. This compares with non-GAAP net income of $20.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and non-GAAP net income of $3.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were $0.18. This compares with GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.00 in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were $0.21. This compares with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.14 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.03 in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments were $243.5 million at December 31, 2016. 
Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Outlook
The guidance for the quarter ending April 1, 2017 is:

Revenues in the range of $156 million to $164 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 36% to 39%. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the range of $32 million to $36 million.
The foregoing guidance is based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Please see the Safe Harbor Statement in this earnings release for a description of certain important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, and refer to Oclaro's most recent annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of these risks. Furthermore, we have not provided reconciliations from non-GAAP to GAAP for our outlook. Certain elements of such reconciliations, such as restructuring and related costs, acquisition or disposal related costs, expenses or income from certain legal actions, settlements and related costs outside our normal course of business, impairments of other long-lived assets and 
other costs and contingencies unrelated to our current and future operations, are highly variable and we are not able to forecast these items within a meaningful range. We are better able to forecast stock-based compensation and amortization of other intangible assets, the two largest elements of such reconciliation, and we expect those elements to be approximately $2.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for the third quarter. We do not intend to update this guidance as a result of developments occurring after the date of this release.

Safe Harbor Statement
This press release, in association with Oclaro's second quarter of fiscal year 2017 financial results conference call, contains statements about management's future expectations, plans or prospects of Oclaro and its business, and together with the assumptions underlying these statements, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements concerning (i) financial guidance for the fiscal quarter ending April 1, 2017 regarding revenues, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP operating income, (ii) the growth of Oclaro's 100G and beyond product revenues, (iii) customer demand 
for Oclaro's products, and (iv) Oclaro's future financial performance and operating prospects. Such statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may contain words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "will," "should," "outlook," "could," "target," "model," "objective," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operations or financial performance. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including (i) our ability to timely develop, commercialize and ramp the production of new products to customer 
required volumes, (ii) our dependence on a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues, (iii) our ability to obtain governmental licenses and approvals for international trading activities or technology transfers, including export licenses, (iv) our ability to meet or exceed our gross margin expectations, (v) the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, (vi) our manufacturing yields, (vii) the risks associated with delays, disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing, (viii) competition and pricing pressure, (ix) our ability to respond to evolving technologies, customer requirements and demands, and product design challenges, (x) our ability to effectively manage our inventory, (xi) our dependence on a limited number of suppliers and key contract manufacturers, (xii) our ability to have our manufacturing lines qualified by our 
customers, (xiii) the impact of financial market and general economic conditions in the industries in which we operate and any resulting reduction in demand for our products, (xiv) the absence of long-term purchase commitments from many of our long-term customers, (xv) our ability to conclude agreements with our customers on favorable terms, (xvi) our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, (xvii) the outcome of tax audits or similar proceedings, (xviii) the risks associated with our international operations, (xix) the outcome of pending litigation against us, and (xx) other factors described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents we periodically file with the SEC.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Oclaro provides certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to its investors as a complement to the most comparable GAAP measures. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross margin rate is gross margin rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating income/loss is operating income/loss. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income/loss. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net income/loss is net income/loss. An explanation and reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information is set forth below.
Oclaro believes that providing these non-GAAP measures to its investors, in addition to corresponding income statement measures, provides investors the benefit of viewing Oclaro's performance using the same financial metrics that the management team uses in making many key decisions and evaluating how Oclaro's "core operating performance" and its results of operations may look in the future. Oclaro defines "core operating performance" as its ongoing performance in the ordinary course of its operations. Items that are non-recurring or do not involve cash expenditures, such as impairment charges, income taxes, restructuring and severance programs, costs relating to specific 
major projects (such as acquisitions), non-cash compensation related to stock and options and certain income, and impairment of fixed assets and inventory and related expenses, are not included in Oclaro's view of "core operating performance." Management does not believe these items are reflective of Oclaro's ongoing core operations and accordingly excludes those items from non-GAAP gross margin rate, non-GAAP operating income/loss, non-GAAP net income/loss and Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, each non-GAAP measure has historically been presented by Oclaro as a complement to its most comparable GAAP measure, and Oclaro believes that the continuation of this practice increases 
the consistency and comparability of Oclaro's earnings releases.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income/loss excluding the impact of income taxes, net interest income/expense, depreciation and amortization, net gains/losses on foreign currency transactions, as well as restructuring, acquisition and related costs, non-cash compensation related to stock and options, and other unusual one-time charges, specifically identified in the non-GAAP reconciliation schedules set forth below. Oclaro uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating Oclaro's historical and prospective cash usage, as well as its cash usage relative to its competitors. Specifically, management uses this non-GAAP measure to further understand and analyze the cash used in/generated from Oclaro's core operations. Oclaro believes that by excluding these non-cash and non-recurring charges, more accurate expectations of its future cash needs can be assessed in addition to providing a better understanding of the actual cash used in or generated from core operations for the periods presented. Oclaro further believes that providing this information allows Oclaro's investors greater transparency and a better understanding of Oclaro's core cash position.

Oclaro is a US-based business manufacturing and selling optical components. Formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, the company now trades on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
The Company was founded in the United Kingdom in 1988 as Bookham Technology.[1] It became the first company to make optical components that can be integrated into a silicon integrated circuit.[1] In 2002 the Company expanded substantially when it acquired the optical components businesses of Marconi and Nortel Networks.[1] In 2003 it acquired Cierra Photonics of Santa Rosa, California, and New Focus, a US business, for £118 million.[2] In 2004 it acquired Onetta, Inc. and became a US-domiciled company. In March 2006, Bookham acquired Avalon Photonics based in Zurich, Switzerland[1]
Avanex Corporation was incorporated in 1997 and had their initial public offering on 4 February 2000 raising $216 million, and was based in Fremont, California.[3] By 2002 (after the dot-com bubble had burst) restructuring included shutting down a plant in Richardson, Texas.[4] In 2003 Avanex acquired Alcatel Optronics France SA from Alcatel and the photonic technology business of Corning Incorporated.[5]
In the first quarter of 2009 Bookham faced increased losses on sales reducing from $50 million to $47 million. In late April 2009 the Bookham and Avanex Corporations announced that they had merged, creating what they hoped would be one of the largest suppliers of optical components, modules and subsystems for telecommunications. The newly combined company was named Oclaro combining the words Optica and Clarity.[6]
Opnext, Inc. was founded as a venture of the Clarity Group and optical researchers from Hitachi.[7] Opnext raised over $253 million on their initial public offering on 15 February 2007.[8] On 26 March 2012, Oclaro, Inc. announced the acquisition of Opnext. The merger between Oclaro and Opnext was approved by shareholders of each company on 23 July 2012.[9]
On 12 September 2013, Oclaro, Inc. announced the sale of their Zurich Gallium Arsenide Laser Diode Business to II-VI Incorporated for $115 Million.As part of the agreement, II-VI has purchased the Oclaro Zurich, Switzerland company, which includes its GaAs fabrication facility, and also the corresponding high power laser diodes, VCSEL and 980 nm pump laser product lines, including intellectual property, inventory, equipment and a related R&D facility in Tucson, Arizona all of which are associated with these businesses. Revenues for the Zurich business were approximately $87 million for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2013.
The company designs, manufacturers and sells optical components primarily for fiber-optic communication networks.

Oclaro is a US-based business manufacturing and selling optical components. Formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, the company now trades on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
The Company was founded in the United Kingdom in 1988 as Bookham Technology.[1] It became the first company to make optical components that can be integrated into a silicon integrated circuit.[1] In 2002 the Company expanded substantially when it acquired the optical components businesses of Marconi and Nortel Networks.[1] In 2003 it acquired Cierra Photonics of Santa Rosa, California, and New Focus, a US business, for £118 million.[2] In 2004 it acquired Onetta, Inc. and became a US-domiciled company. In March 2006, Bookham acquired Avalon Photonics based in Zurich, Switzerland[1]
Avanex Corporation was incorporated in 1997 and had their initial public offering on 4 February 2000 raising $216 million, and was based in Fremont, California.[3] By 2002 (after the dot-com bubble had burst) restructuring included shutting down a plant in Richardson, Texas.[4] In 2003 Avanex acquired Alcatel Optronics France SA from Alcatel and the photonic technology business of Corning Incorporated.[5]
In the first quarter of 2009 Bookham faced increased losses on sales reducing from $50 million to $47 million. In late April 2009 the Bookham and Avanex Corporations announced that they had merged, creating what they hoped would be one of the largest suppliers of optical components, modules and subsystems for telecommunications. The newly combined company was named Oclaro combining the words Optica and Clarity.[6]
Opnext, Inc. was founded as a venture of the Clarity Group and optical researchers from Hitachi.[7] Opnext raised over $253 million on their initial public offering on 15 February 2007.[8] On 26 March 2012, Oclaro, Inc. announced the acquisition of Opnext. The merger between Oclaro and Opnext was approved by shareholders of each company on 23 July 2012.[9]
On 12 September 2013, Oclaro, Inc. announced the sale of their Zurich Gallium Arsenide Laser Diode Business to II-VI Incorporated for $115 Million.As part of the agreement, II-VI has purchased the Oclaro Zurich, Switzerland company, which includes its GaAs fabrication facility, and also the corresponding high power laser diodes, VCSEL and 980 nm pump laser product lines, including intellectual property, inventory, equipment and a related R&D facility in Tucson, Arizona all of which are associated with these businesses. Revenues for the Zurich business were approximately $87 million for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2013.
The company designs, manufacturers and sells optical components primarily for fiber-optic communication networks.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
