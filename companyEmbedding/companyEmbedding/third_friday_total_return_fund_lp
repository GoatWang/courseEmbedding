Published on Mar 14, 2016For 20 years, Michael Lewitt has managed billions of dollars for institutions like Texas Teachers, LA County Employee Retirement, and large hedge funds like Omega Advisers. He also wrote “The Death Of Capital: How Creative Policy Can Restore Stability” (John Wiley & Sons) and is the Editor & Publisher of The Credit Strategist, a monthly newsletter that has focused on the global economy and financial market since 2001. It was one of the few publications to predict the 2001 and 2008 credit crises.Since Sept. 2012 Michael is the general partner of The Third Friday Total Return Fund, one of the best performing hedge funds in 2015 on a risk-adjusted basis:     While the fund started in 2007, the strategy started 10 years before that, meaning that the fund’s underlying options strategy has been developed and perfected over 20 years through many difficult markets     Since fund inception in May 2007, net annualized return +7.86 % compares favorably against +2.75% for the HFRI Composite Hedge Fund Index and annualized total return of +6.05% for the S&P 500.     In 2015, The Third Friday Total Return Fund earned a net return of +8.26 % versus -0.85% for the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Hedge Fund Index and +1.38% total return for the S&P 500. The fund had only only two negative months (one by only -0.02%) while the S&P 500 was negative in 6 of the 12 months of the year.     In Jan. 2016, the fund was up +0.23%.     Fund uses no leverage and invests its collateral in Treasuries, cash, and a diversified short-to-intermediate portfolio of municipal and corporate bonds. In 2015, cash positions were well over 50% throughout the year. In this Opalesque.TV BACKSTAGE video, Michael Lewitt explains what attracted him - a veteran with almost 30 years in the industry having managed billions in credit funds - to take over the general partnership of Third Friday.By selling at the money straddles of S&P index and hedging them by buying out of the money puts and calls, the fund is truly market-neutral and protects capital with several “rings of defence” against normal and outsized market moves.What’s interesting about the strategy is that it extracts returns from volatility and time value in options - characteristics that are always present in markets. The fund also benefits from a loss mitigation mechanism: Its recovery from the one seriously negative month in 2015 (-3.14% in August) demonstrates how the strategy is designed to recover from losses by taking advantage of the rising options premiums that naturally follow bad months to generate higher returns in the subsequent months. Straddles on the S&P 500 index are among the most liquid instruments in the world. Accordingly, the fund can accommodate significant growth without any diminution in liquidity or return.Hear Michael also speak about:     How will the strategy do if markets plunge 1000 points in one day?     The role of discipline     Liquidity profile and capacity.     Current investor base and available fund vehiclesMichael Lewitt started his career 1987 at Drexel Burnham Lambert. He was recognized in the Financial Times as having been one of the few investors and strategists to forecast the financial crisis of 2008, and also predicted the credit crisis of 2001-2002.In 1991 Michael co-founded and served as President of Harch Capital Management (HCM). From 1991-2001 he was co-lead portfolio manager and from 2001-2011 lead portfolio manager for billions of dollars of below investment grade corporate credit strategies (including hedge funds, CDOs and separate accounts) for institutional and individual clients. Michael successfully invested on both the long and short sides of the debt markets during this period. He also functioned as chief legal and compliance officer of the firm. Over his 20 years at HCM, Michael led an investment team that generated consistent market-beating returns.Third Friday relies on execution of a strategy that has been developed and perfected over the last 20 years through many difficult markets. The initial strategy was created in the 1990s and was run initially as a family partnership and operated as such for several years until Michael Lewitt joined the fund in November 2012 to grow it into an institutional hedge fund.

Third Friday Total Return Fund 4Q15 Letter

Third Friday Total Return Fund letter to partners for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015.
Dear Fellow Partner,
Third Friday Total Return Fund – Performance
In 2015, The Third Friday Total Return Fund, L.P. (the “Fund”) earned a net return (unaudited) of +8.26% compared to -0.85% for the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Hedge Fund Index and a +1.38% total return for the S&P 500.
In the fourth quarter, the Fund earned a net return of +3.48% compared to +0.99% for the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Hedge Fund Index and +7.04% for the S&P 500.
Since inception in May 2007, the Fund has earned a net annualized return (audited through 12/31/14) of +7.86% compared with a net annualized return of +2.75% for the HFRI Composite Hedge Fund Index and an annualized total return of +6.05% for the S&P 500. A complete statistical analysis of the Fund’s performance since inception is attached to this letter.
We wrote you recently in view of the unusual volatility with which markets have started the year to let you know that Third Friday is weathering the storm extremely well. The Fund is well hedged and even better hedged than it was last August when the market experienced a similar downdraft.
Third Friday Total Return Fund – Strategy
Third Friday was one of the best performing hedge funds in 2015 particularly when its returns are evaluated on a risk-adjusted basis. The fund employs no leverage and ran cash positions of well over 50% throughout the year. We decided to reduce our holdings of corporate bonds at the end of the year to zero in order to maximize the capital that can be invested in options in 2016. In 2015, our return suffered by approximately 150 basis points due because our corporate bond positions not only generated a small loss but also diverted about $2.5 million of capital investments in options that were generating 10%+ annualized returns. We decided to reallocate this capital away from bonds and towards options at the end of the year in the expectation that the bond market will continue to underperform in 2016.
Third Friday was started as a family partnership and operated as such for several years until I joined the fund in November 2012 to grow it into an institutional hedge fund. The assets in the fund have grown by 20-fold since then. In addition, we had over $140 million of total assets in the strategy at year end and our growth is accelerating. We launched an offshore fund on July 1 and are in the process of preparing an insurance dedicated fund.
It should be noted that our returns should not suffer as a result of rapid growth. Unlike other strategies that encounter liquidity problems or require the generation of new ideas as they grow, Third Friday simply applies the same investment strategy to a larger number of options straddles. Furthermore, these straddles on the S&P 500 index are among the most liquid instruments in the world. Accordingly, the Fund can accommodate significant growth without any diminution in liquidity or returns. Our world class service providers – auditor RSM LLP (formerly known as McGladrey LLP), law firm HaynesBoone and administrator SS&C – and our own professional staff are focused on producing superior risk-adjusted returns for all our partners as we actively grow the Fund. The general partner is committed to reinvest virtually all of its performance fees in the Fund for the duration of its life as an expression of its commitment to our partners and our belief in the strategy.
Third Friday Total Return Fund – Market Outlook
In 2015, most hedge funds, mutual funds and other investments generated disappointing returns. I wrote in January 2015 in The Credit Strategist that the thesis that a bear market cannot occur without the onset of a bear market and aggressive Fed tightening would be questioned at the zero bound. That thesis was tested and it flunked as the stock market experienced a stealth bear market and the high yield bond market basically crashed. Today, the majority of stocks in the S&P 500 are trading 20% below their 52- week highs, the definition of a bear market. Arguments promulgated by Wall Street economists and the mainstream media last year that stocks would rise, oil prices would recover and low oil prices would benefit the economy – all of which I challenged repeatedly in The Credit Strategist – proved to be wrong. Instead, stocks struggled, oil prices dropped further, and low oil prices turned out to be bad news for the U.S. economy. Unfortunately, more of the same is likely in store for investors in 2016. Add to that an increasingly unstable geopolitical situation and you have a recipe for further market losses.
Investors in Third Friday, however, need not worry about these problems. Third Friday doesn’t generate its returns from the direction of the market; instead, it extracts returns from the volatility and time value embedded in options. While I have every confidence in my market calls, Third Friday’s returns do not rely on them being correct. Instead, Third Friday relies on execution of a strategy that has been developed and perfected over the last 20 years through many difficult markets. We proved this again in 2015 by experiencing only two negative months (one by only -0.02%) while the S&P 500 was negative in 6 of the 12 months of the year. Further, we demonstrated in our recovery from our one seriously negative month (-3.14% in August) how our strategy is designed to recover from losses by taking advantage of the rising options premiums that naturally follow bad months to generate higher returns in the subsequent months. This built-in feature of the strategy mitigates losses and protects capital.
Conclusion
There are very few ways for any investor, whether an institution or an individual, to earn consistent high single digit/low double digit returns in liquid strategies in any market environment. That is particularly true in today’s world. There are few if any strategies that can compete with either the risk-adjusted returns or the short-term liquidity that Third Friday offers. Most hedge funds require investors to lock up their money, invest capital in a limited number of concentrated positions, employ high amounts of leverage, pay much higher fees, and at the end of the day produce lower risk-adjusted returns with much higher volatility and much lower liquidity. And we have been doing this consistently for more than eight years in the Fund and much longer in separate accounts.
I would like to thank all of our partners and service providers for their support. We are actively seeking new investors to the fund and welcome referrals and additional capital from existing partners. If you think you know someone who would be interested in investing in Third Friday, or if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me directly at [email protected] or (561) 239-1510.
Sincerely,
Michael E. Lewitt

What attracted Michael Lewitt, who at his own credit hedge fund previously managed billions of dollars in corporate credit strategies, to take over the general partnership of Third Friday? 1. Third Friday fund was up .12% in 2008. 2. Fund is truly market-neutral (sells simultaneous puts and calls in straddles). 3. Extracts returns from volatility and time value in options - characteristics that are always present in markets.

03:14

Description of the options straddle strategy of Third Friday Total Return Fund. - Selling three at the money straddles per million of the S&P 500, collecting premium. - No leverage. - Hedging of the straddles by buying out of the money puts and calls.

04:31

Adjusting of hedges during the month. Two or more “Rings of Defence” protect capital during normal and outsized market moves. How will the strategy do if market plunges 1000 points in one day?

09:27

Built-in loss mitigation mechanism takes advantage of rising options  premiums  that  naturally  follow  bad  months.

14:12

Current investor base: Onshore and offshore vehicles available. Summary of investor benefits: - Excellent absolute & risk-adjusted returns yet liquid. - Strategy does well when other risk assets underperform. - World-class service providers.

18:07

“Others trade options but not the way we do”. The role of discipline. Fund started in 2007, but strategy started 10 years before that.






Third Friday Total Return Fund, one of the best performing hedge funds on a risk-adjusted basis, gets institutional traction
Feb 12 2016
1 Comment


						For 20 years, Michael Lewitt has managed billions of dollars for institutions like Texas Teachers, LA County Employee Retirement, and large hedge funds like Omega Advisers. He also wrote “The Death Of Capital: How Creative Policy Can Restore Stability” (John Wiley & Sons) and is the Editor & Publisher of The Credit Strategist, a monthly newsletter that has focused on the global economy and financial market since 2001. It was one of the few publications to predict the 2001 and 2008 credit crises.Since Sept. 2012 Michael is the general partner of The Third Friday Total Return Fund, one of the best performing hedge funds in 2015 on a risk-adjusted basis:While the fund started in 2007, the strategy started 10 years before that, meaning that the fund’s underlying options strategy  has  been developed and perfected over 20 years through many difficult markets
Since  fund inception  in  May  2007,  net  annualized  return  +7.86 % compares favorably against +2.75% for the  HFRI Composite  Hedge Fund Index and annualized total return of +6.05% for the S&P 500. 
In 2015, The Third Friday Total Return Fund earned a net return of +8.26 % versus -0.85% for the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Hedge Fund Index and +1.38% total return for the S&P 500.  The fund had only only two negative months (one by only -0.02%) while the S&P 500 was negative in 6 of the 12 months of the year.
In Jan. 2016, the fund was up +0.23%.
Fund uses no leverage and invests its collateral in Treasuries, cash, and a diversified short-to-intermediate portfolio of municipal and corporate bonds. In 2015, cash positions were well over 50% throughout the year. In this Opalesque.TV BACKSTAGE video, Michael Lewitt explains what attracted him - a veteran with almost 30 years in the industry having managed billions in credit funds - to take over the general partnership of Third Friday.By selling at the money straddles of S&P index and hedging them by buying out of the money puts and calls, the fund is truly market-neutral and protects capital with several “rings of defence” against normal and outsized market moves. What’s interesting about the strategy is that it extracts returns from volatility and time value in options - characteristics that are always present in markets. The fund also benefits from a loss mitigation mechanism: Its recovery from the one seriously negative month in 2015 (-3.14% in August) demonstrates how the strategy is designed to recover from losses by taking advantage of the rising options premiums that naturally follow bad months to generate higher returns in the subsequent months. Straddles on the S&P 500 index are among the most liquid instruments in the world.  Accordingly, the fund can accommodate significant growth without any diminution in liquidity or return.Hear Michael also speak about:
How will the strategy do if markets plunge 1000 points in one day? 
The role of discipline
Liquidity profile and capacity.
Current investor base and available fund vehiclesMichael Lewitt started his career 1987 at Drexel Burnham Lambert. He was recognized in the Financial Times as having been one of the few investors and strategists to forecast the financial crisis of 2008, and also predicted the credit crisis of 2001-2002.  In 1991 Michael co-founded and served as President of Harch Capital Management (HCM). From 1991-2001 he was co-lead portfolio manager and from 2001-2011 lead portfolio manager for billions of dollars of below investment grade corporate credit strategies (including hedge funds, CDOs and separate accounts) for institutional and individual clients. Michael successfully invested on both the long and short sides of the debt markets during this period.  He also functioned as chief legal and compliance officer of the firm. Over his 20 years at HCM, Michael led an investment team that generated consistent market-beating returns. Third  Friday  relies  on  execution  of  a  strategy  that  has  been developed and perfected over the last 20 years through many difficult markets. The initial strategy was created in the 1990s and was run initially as a family partnership and operated as such for several years until Michael Lewitt joined the fund in November 2012 to grow it into an institutional hedge fund.
