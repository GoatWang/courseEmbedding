VM1000 - Vesper
















































VM1000
Piezoelectric MEMS Microphone
Create the most acoustically rich consumer products for all sound environments.
From smartphones and wearables to smart home devices, consumers use sound-enabled products in the real world. That’s why MEMS microphones have to work in real-world environments, not just some of the time, but all of the time. Vesper’s VM1000 does just that.








Robust and Reliable
As the industry’s first piezoelectric MEMS microphone, VM1000 is the most robust and reliable MEMS microphone for consumer products.
It is waterproof, dustproof, particle-resistant and shockproof so you can immerse it in water, bathe it in dust, expose it to particulate matter or drop it on the ground, and it keeps working properly. It’s a microphone on which you can depend. And although your customers won’t recognize it with their bare eyes, they will appreciate it with their ears.

Exceptionally Stable
Consumers want far-field audio applications in smartphones and in IoT devices.
They want to record from across the room and use voice to control their smart TV. It is far-field audio applications like these that are making microphone arrays so popular, but there’s a problem: Microphone arrays require microphones that are carefully matched in terms of phase and sensitivity.
Here again, capacitive MEMS microphones fall down. Once they leave the factory floor, they are prone to “drift,” so their performance is unstable. As a piezoelectric MEMS microphone, VM1000 uses a much simpler and more consistent manufacturing process as well as easier, less expensive ASIC calibration — ensuring that phase and sensitivity are well matched. Very stable over time and in harsh environments, VM1000 microphones in an array always stay matched in all environmental conditions.







Ambient Noise Cancellation and Audio Zoom
As a very high SNR microphone, VM1000 delivers an acoustically rich experience for a range of applications.

VM1000 offers better ambient noise cancellation, so phone calls and recordings sound clearer. It also provides superior “audio zoom” – giving consumers more accurate sound-selection when they are recording.




Technical Specifications
VM1000 is an omnidirectional, single-ended analog output MEMS microphone.


Features

Ultra-low noise, bottom-port
Low part-to-part variation
High dynamic range
Durable piezoelectric MEMS construction
Drop-in replacement for existing capacitive MEMS microphones
