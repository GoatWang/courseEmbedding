Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

                                                        Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency 
                                                        fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Funds focusing on a single sector 
                                                        generally experience greater price volatility. Investments in emerging, offshore or 
                                                        frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in

                                                        governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. 
                                                        A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may be more vulnerable to any single 
                                                        economic or regulatory development. The Fund invests in the securities included in, 
                                                        or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does 
                                                        not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.

Investment Approach

											We seek a high level of current income, with a secondary investment objective of long-term capital appreciation by investing in a range of sovereign, quasi-sovereign and corporate debt securities in emerging markets. Investments are mostly denominated in emerging market and/or non-U.S. currencies. We believe that emerging markets experiencing positive fundamental change may present attractive investment opportunities for investors. To help achieve its objective, we combine top-down country allocation with bottom-up security selection.

Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors /Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the fund's current annual report.
Growth of Investment illustration is based on an initial investment of $10,000 made since fund inception, assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not include sales charges and fees. Performance would have been lower if sales charges and fees had been included. Results are hypothetical.
Please keep in mind that high double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions. 
The Net Asset Value (NAV) per share is determined by dividing the value of the fund's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the fund at a given time. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the fund's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the period. SEC yield is a measure of the income generated by the portfolio's underlying asset over the trailing 30 days, relative to the asset base of the portfolio itself. The SEC 30-Day yield - Subsidized (Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The SEC 30-Day yield- Unsubsidized (Unsub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect.
Subject to change daily. Fund information and Portfolio Composition are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the sectors and countries presented. Monthly Holdings are updated 15 calendar days after month-end.
The use of leverage may increase the volatility in the Portfolio.
The repurchase information only represents shares repurchased as part of a share repurchase program and does not account for any shares repurchased through a tender offer.
RISK CONSIDERATIONS
There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is significant possibility of loss. Concentration in a single region may make the portfolio more volatile than one that invests globally. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In the current rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Investments in securities rated below investment grade (commonly known as "junk bonds") present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility.

The JPMorgan Global Bond Index-Emerging Markets Global Diversified Index is a comprehensive global local emerging markets index that consists of regularly traded, liquid fixed-rate, domestic currency, government bonds and includes only the countries that give access to their capital market to foreign investors (excludes China, India, and Thailand). The index is market capitalization weighted, with a cap of 10% to any one country. This index is unhedged USD.

Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.

Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) is the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.


 






 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

2The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index consists of the following 23 emerging market country indices: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
        The MSCI Emerging Markets Investment Market Index (MSCI EM IMI) is a free float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to capture large-, mid- and small-cap representation across 23 emerging markets countries. Emerging Markets countries include: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Qatar, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.

EMSD - WisdomTree Strong Dollar Emerging Markets Equity Fund
































































                                    Emerging markets continue to offer diversification and growth potential, 
                                    but the U.S. dollar’s recent strengthening trend has strongly affected returns.
                                    

                                    The WisdomTree Strong Dollar Emerging Markets Equity Fund (EMSD) enables investors to capitalize 
                                    on the emerging market companies and sectors expected to perform better in strong U.S. 
                                    dollar environments, while maintaining diversification.

                                                        frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in

                                                        economic or regulatory development. The Fund invests in the securities included in,

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
