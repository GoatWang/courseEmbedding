FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Piping Technology & Products, Inc. has developed a number of standard
                          
                          designs based on our experience fabricating anchors for the different
                          
                          requirements of our customers. The Pipe Shoe Wizard helps you to choose your required pipe shoe based on  the standards included in
                          
                          this section of the catalog. 
 Slide plates may be included on the pipe shoes and must have a low-friction material to slide smoothly, usually  PTFE, 25% glass filled  or graphite. Graphite is used for higher temperatures and
                          
                          loads. For temperatures above 500Â° F, it is good practice to include bolting to
                          
                          insure the graphite remains fixed to its steel backing during movement. Please
                          
                          see the Slide Plate section of this catalog for more details. 
 We will fabricate shoes and anchors to your design or help you develop
                          
                          special designs to meet your special requirements.

Pipe Support Hardware






                  Piping Technology & Products, Inc. maintains an extensive inventory of
                  
                  components required for pipe hanger and support assemblies. Most of these are
                  
                  industry standards which have been used by piping designers for many years. One
                  
                  of the value-added services we provide is assembly and tagging of units before
                  
                  shipping so field crews can install them with minimal effort. Since we work with
                  
                  these materials daily, it is easier for us to do assemblies and verify
                  
                  components and dimensions than it is for a field crew, for whom installing pipe
                  
                  supports is only one of many tasks to be performed in a given work day.

Many pipe hanger assemblies are attached to the pipe with clamps. Our inventories include                                        all types of clamps made from carbon steel with galvanized and black finishes.                                        We can fabricate clamps from alloy steels for high-temperature applications in                                        which standard clamps are not adequate. When ordering your clamps, please add an                                        "A" to the figure number of any items that you wish to be fabricated                                        from our special alloy material. We have included a chart to help in the                                        specification of special clamps for high-temperatures and heavy loads.

To compensate for pipe movement, a designer may choose from a variety of  clevis hangers, roller hangers, and adjustable bands to support the pipe. These                                        are linked to the supporting structure with rods and other  hardware                                            components.  Beam attachments and other accessories are attached to the supporting structure                                        to complete the pipe hanger assembly. All of these components must be strong enough to                                        support the loads in the environment where they are installed. Galvanized                                        components are often used to resist corrosion.

Saddle coverings are used with insulated pipes in order to provide protection                                        to the insulation at points of support. Roller stands, elbow supports, and other                                        items can be supplied in adjustable models which allow field crews to make easy                                        installations. Hold-downs are special clamping supports used on pipes which are subject to                                        large vibrations and stresses, such as those near compressors. The hold-downs                                        dampen these forces by transferring them to the supporting structure, and thus                                        protect the piping system.
