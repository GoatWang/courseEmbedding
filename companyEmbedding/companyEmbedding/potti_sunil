SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nutanix, 
      the web-scale converged infrastructure company, today announced the 
      appointment of Sunil Potti to the position of senior vice president of 
      engineering and product management. With more than 20 years of 
      datacenter and networking experience, Sunil joins Nutanix from Citrix 
      (NASDAQ:CTXS), where he led the Citrix NetScaler business for over five 
      years of record growth. Throughout his career, he has built 
      industry-leading products and scaled teams against intense competition 
      from large incumbent players. At Nutanix he will oversee all product 
      functions including product strategy, development, and quality.
    


      “Sunil is an entrepreneur at heart who has both built and scaled 
      successful enterprise businesses,” said Dheeraj Pandey, co-founder and 
      CEO, Nutanix. “The coming five years of Nutanix require people like 
      Sunil who bring together the ‘why’ of Product Management with the ‘how’ 
      and ‘what’ of Engineering. He is a world-class product executive who is 
      broad and customer-centric. I am delighted he is here to build on our 
      Act II.”
    

      Overseeing Citrix’s NetScaler business, Sunil was responsible for record 
      growth over five consecutive years and cementing NetScaler as a 
      respected datacenter infrastructure solution powering many of the 
      world’s largest clouds, Internet properties, global enterprises and 
      service providers. He joined Citrix from F5 Networks, where he was vice 
      president of the acceleration and virtualization group. Prior to F5, he 
      co-founded and led all product efforts for application-oriented 
      networking at Cisco. Previous to this, Sunil was an early employee at 
      Synchrony, a CRM startup acquired by Divine, where he headed products 
      and engineering. Sunil holds a master’s degree in computer science from 
      Pennsylvania State University.
    

      “Nutanix is upending the market by providing truly innovative web-scale 
      technology to enterprises and global service providers,” said Sunil 
      Potti. “I have always been passionate about working on fast growing and 
      innovative technologies, and Nutanix has the most impressive combination 
      of market transformation opportunity, disruptive technology and world 
      class talent I have seen. In a relatively short period of time, Nutanix 
      has built strong brand equity and inspired delight with over 1000 
      customers worldwide by being the only solution to make datacenter 
      infrastructure truly simple. To be joining the company at this stage is 
      very exciting.”
