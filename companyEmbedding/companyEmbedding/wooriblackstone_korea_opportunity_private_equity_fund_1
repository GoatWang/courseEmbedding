Acushnet IPO form shows annual net sales of $1.5 billion - Golf Digest

Soon, you can own a piece of it.But before you do, make sure you wade through the company’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, registering for an initial public offering of common stock.That form, which runs for more than 300 pages, outlines Acushnet’s current financial performance and details the company’s position in the marketplace as “the global leader in the design, development, manufacture and distribution of performance-driven golf products, which are widely recognized for their quality and  excellence.”That excellence includes an increase in net sales from $1.336 billion in 2011 to 2015’s year-end number of $1.503 billion. By comparison, Callaway, golf's only other publicly traded equipment company, generated just shy of $900 million in net sales in 2015. TaylorMade-adidas Golf, whose sales are listed under Adidas Group's financial statements, produced just over $1 billion in net sales in 2015.The form also shows how the company spent between $42 million and $46 million annually on research and development from 2013 to 2015, and slightly more than $200 million annually on advertising and promotional expenses, including “product endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional golf tours.”The form details that 36 percent of Acushnet’s net sales come from Titleist golf balls, 26 percent came from Titleist clubs and 28 percent came from FootJoy. In 2015, that included approximately $535.5 million in Titleist golf balls, approximately $388.3 million in Titleist golf clubs and $418.9 million from FootJoy apparel, gloves and shoes.The S-1 form is required by the SEC before shares can be listed on a national exchange. The expected sale date of Acushnet stock is listed on the form as “as soon as practicable,” effective June 17. No exchange was specified.The shares of common stock will be sold by the existing stockholders of Acushnet, a group that includes its current primary owner of shares Fila Korea Ltd., which purchased Acushnet for $1.23 billion in 2011. Fila joined with Mirae Asset, which funded $544 million, the National Pension Service of Korea (approximately $44 million) and the Korea Development Bank (a $500 million term loan), in making the purchase.The principal shareholders listed in the SEC form are Fila Korea Ltd., Mirae Funds, Woori-Blackstone Korea Opportunity Private Equity Fund and Neoplux Co. Ltd. Woori-Blackstone Korea Opportunity Private Equity Fund is a subsidiary of Woori Finance Holdings, the largest bank in South Korea. Neoplux Co. Ltd. is an investment arm of Doosan Corp. Doosan is a century-old company based in Korea with multiple businesses in heavy machinery and engineering, and one of that country’s top ten conglomerates.According to the form, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for 2015 was $214.7 million and $80.8 million for the first three months of 2016. The entire form can be viewed here.Several investment banks are listed as underwriting the IPO, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and UBS Investment Bank as lead book-running managers. Credit Suisse, Daiwa Capital Markets, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies and Wells Fargo are also listed as joint book-running managers.Acushnet plans to be listed under the symbol “GOLF.”While this morning’s announcement indicated no proposed number of shares or price range, a Reuters report last month speculated that the IPO could yield $2 billion. The Acushnet form lists the maximum value of shares offered at $100 million, but that number could merely be a placeholder that could be adjusted once shares are actually sold.FacebookTwitterMore from The LoopBench WarmersCzech soccer team cracks open giant beer can dugoutsJuly 27, 2017Is It Fall Yet?Summer is dead and these swimming overalls murdered itJuly 27, 2017Viral VideoSergio Garcia and his fiancee play the Newlywed Game, and it does not go wellJuly 27, 2017Hollywood EndingBoy who went viral for crying over new baseball bat hits homer with it, and it gets better...July 27, 2017Throwback ThursdayWatch Harold Varner III recreate Tiger's incredible shot from 2000 Canadian OpenJuly 27, 2017Happy birthday, JordanJordan Spieth celebrates his birthday by getting creative with the claret jugJuly 27, 2017Viral VideosPlayful Adrian Beltre moves on-deck-circle to him, miserable umpire ejects himJuly 27, 2017MemorabiliaDanny Willett's golf-bag barstools are a man-cave fantasyJuly 27, 2017The Game of LifeNew eSports league's salary and benefits will make you feel like Biff LomanJuly 26, 2017Getting Jiggy With ItThis week's Web.com Tour event will have walk-up music for golfers -- with a twistJuly 26, 2017BloopersDodgers prospect hits the craziest home run you've ever seenJuly 26, 2017Show MoreRelatedGolf InstructionTip Plus - Jim Flick: Save Your Speed For ImpactGolf InstructionFix The Chipping YipsGolf InstructionJim Flick: 'Tie' Your Knee To Your ArmAccessibility HelpSubscriptionSubscribeManage SubscriptionGive a GiftInternational SubscriptionResourcesContact UsAccessibility HelpReprints/PermissionsGolf Digest Media KitGolf World Media KitSite MapProducts & ServicesGolf Digest ShopGolf Digest PerksGolf Digest Tournament ShopHole-In-OneGolf Digest PlannerGolf World BoardroomGolf Digest InsidersCondé NastCondé Nast DigitalAllureArs TechnicaBackchannelBon AppétitBridesCondé Nast TravelerEpicuriousGlamourGolf DigestGolf WorldGQGQ StylePitchforkSelfStyleTeen VogueThe New YorkerThe SceneVanity FairVogueWWiredCondé Nast CollectionCareersUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective 1/2/2014) and Privacy Policy (effective 1/2/2014). Golf Digest  may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers. Your California Privacy Rights  The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast.©2017 Condé Nast.

The government, which holds a 57 percent stake in Woori worth around $6 billion, plans to announce a detailed sales plan for the country's No.3 banking group in coming weeks. Industry officials do not expect it to be sold as a single block.  Woori Chief Executive Lee Pal-seung had met Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman on Tuesday in New York and had asked the U.S. firm to participate in the auction, the Korea Economic Daily and MoneyToday said, both in unsourced reports.  A Woori spokesman said the group could not confirm whether privatization was discussed, and said Lee had met Schwarzman as a business partner because a Woori unit has invested $60 million in a private equity fund run by Blackstone.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
