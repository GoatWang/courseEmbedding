  Transforming clinical trials for sponsors, sites and patients






 


  Leadership

Our journey started in 1999 when a lab scientist, founder Glen de Vries, looked for a way to make clinical trials run better.  With a SaaS technology solution taking shape, he connected with businessman Tarek Sherif to start a company that would focus solely on advancing clinical testing.  Today, that same entrepreneurial spirit and passion for innovation is transforming clinical development across the globe through our 1,000+ team and widespread client and partner network.

  Clients & Partners

We're proud to be part of a global ecosystem of over 400 clients—emerging biotechs, global pharma companies, cutting-edge device and diagnostic companies, innovative academic research sites, broad-mandate government agencies and others—who use our platform every day.  We've supported more than 9,000 clinical trials, 200,000 sites and two million trial volunteers with the infrastructure and insights to bring their new treatments to the public.  Further extending our reach, over 50 top contract research organizations around the world deliver our solutions to their clients.

  Corporate Social Responsibility

We believe our commitment to transforming the life sciences industry should extend beyond our product solutions. Through both employee and company efforts, we want to have a positive impact on research, education, public health and environmental sustainability. It is our vision to be one of the leaders in corporate social responsibility in both the life sciences and technology sectors.

The Platform for transforming clinical research
The life science industry is under pressure. As key patents are expiring, pharma and biotech companies are challenged to bring new and better treatments to patients.

Cut clinical development costs
Mitigate clinical development risks
Deliver drugs and devices to market faster
The Clinical Cloud already encompasses eight billion clinical records from more than three million patients across more than 12,000 studies. And more than one million data points are added daily. Find out why hundreds of sponsors and CROs are already in the Clinical Cloud, and how it can help you transform clinical development today.

The industry’s leading unified EDC and CDMS solution



Medidata RaveX is the world’s leading solution for capturing, managing and reporting patient data, including unified EDC, CDMS and lab administration features.
RaveX is the cornerstone of the Medidata Clinical Cloud, allowing you to seamlessly add Medidata’s randomization, trial supply, medical coding, safety reporting and mHealth capabilities as your organizational needs grow. 








Features and Benefits




Medidata Rave is:
Flexible. Don’t twist your processes to fit technology limitations. Rave flexibility accommodates your workflow requirements. Make mid-study changes—including adaptive trials, protocol amendments and updated requirements—easily with no system downtime. Medidata Rave manages multiple case report form (CRF) editions and seamlessly migrates existing data into new forms and structures.
Scalable. Medidata Rave’s cloud-native architecture scales from one study to hundreds, and from Phase-I all the way to global Phase-IV. Whatever your trial phase or business growth, one cloud system is all you need.
Configurable. Simple or complex study requirements, Medidata Rave handles them all without custom programming. Easily configure CRFs, workflows, data blinding, source document verification (SDV) requirements, dictionary coding and more. All via a point-and-click browser interface.
Medidata Rave goes beyond traditional EDC and offers value added data management and reporting capabilities.

Legal Problems[edit]
On September 16, 2014, a Medidata accounting employee received an e-mail message that appeared to be from a company executive requesting a transfer of nearly $4.8 million to a bank account in China in regard to an acquisition. After receiving approval from two supervisors who also received similar e-mails, the money was transferred. When the transaction request was discovered to have been a fraud, Medidata filed an insurance claim, which was denied by its insurer, Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb Ltd. At issue was Federal Insurance’s claim that its policy only covered losses resulting from fraudulent entry or hacking into a computer system, and not voluntary transfers perpetuated by manipulation” while Medidata asserted that “the policy’s plain language defines data as ‘any information” in Medidata’s computer system.” On March 10, 2016, a New York federal judge refused both parties’ requests for summary judgment saying that there was not enough evidence to make a ruling. The fraudsters were never identified, and the transferred funds were never recovered. Neither side has filed any additional claims. [15] [16]
On March 15, 2017, the company's Japan subsidiary, Medidata Solutions K.K., was found to have wrongfully dismissed its Tokyo IT Director in 2015 after the company had asked him to fly from Tokyo to New York to receive the notice, which occurred weeks after he had filed two ethics reports on his boss for a nepotism hire and failure to address a security hole. The Tokyo District Court ruled that the company, which had sued the employee after he refused to voluntarily resign and was unilaterally dismissed, had not satisfied any of the four prerequisites from the Doctrine of Abusive Dismissal, which are necessary for a restructuring dismissal in Japan. As a result of the judgment, all back salary and bonuses in excess of 30 million yen were ordered to be paid, and the company has a legal obligation to continue to employee the man whose status as an employee was affirmed by the court. [17]
On January 26,2017, Medidata filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against five former VP level employees and Veeva Systems Inc. for breach of contract related to noncompete contract clauses and theft of trade secrets and confidential information. The complaint asserted that Veeva has been deliberately targeting Medidata employees, naming 11 junior level employees who had been hired by Veeva over the past two years as well as the unsuccessful solicitation of at least five additional senior level Medidata employees. The company is seeking injunctive relief and damages to be determined at trial. [18]

Legal Problems[edit]
On September 16, 2014, a Medidata accounting employee received an e-mail message that appeared to be from a company executive requesting a transfer of nearly $4.8 million to a bank account in China in regard to an acquisition. After receiving approval from two supervisors who also received similar e-mails, the money was transferred. When the transaction request was discovered to have been a fraud, Medidata filed an insurance claim, which was denied by its insurer, Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb Ltd. At issue was Federal Insurance’s claim that its policy only covered losses resulting from fraudulent entry or hacking into a computer system, and not voluntary transfers perpetuated by manipulation” while Medidata asserted that “the policy’s plain language defines data as ‘any information” in Medidata’s computer system.” On March 10, 2016, a New York federal judge refused both parties’ requests for summary judgment saying that there was not enough evidence to make a ruling. The fraudsters were never identified, and the transferred funds were never recovered. Neither side has filed any additional claims. [15] [16]
On March 15, 2017, the company's Japan subsidiary, Medidata Solutions K.K., was found to have wrongfully dismissed its Tokyo IT Director in 2015 after the company had asked him to fly from Tokyo to New York to receive the notice, which occurred weeks after he had filed two ethics reports on his boss for a nepotism hire and failure to address a security hole. The Tokyo District Court ruled that the company, which had sued the employee after he refused to voluntarily resign and was unilaterally dismissed, had not satisfied any of the four prerequisites from the Doctrine of Abusive Dismissal, which are necessary for a restructuring dismissal in Japan. As a result of the judgment, all back salary and bonuses in excess of 30 million yen were ordered to be paid, and the company has a legal obligation to continue to employee the man whose status as an employee was affirmed by the court. [17]
On January 26,2017, Medidata filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against five former VP level employees and Veeva Systems Inc. for breach of contract related to noncompete contract clauses and theft of trade secrets and confidential information. The complaint asserted that Veeva has been deliberately targeting Medidata employees, naming 11 junior level employees who had been hired by Veeva over the past two years as well as the unsuccessful solicitation of at least five additional senior level Medidata employees. The company is seeking injunctive relief and damages to be determined at trial. [18]

Legal Problems[edit]
On September 16, 2014, a Medidata accounting employee received an e-mail message that appeared to be from a company executive requesting a transfer of nearly $4.8 million to a bank account in China in regard to an acquisition. After receiving approval from two supervisors who also received similar e-mails, the money was transferred. When the transaction request was discovered to have been a fraud, Medidata filed an insurance claim, which was denied by its insurer, Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb Ltd. At issue was Federal Insurance’s claim that its policy only covered losses resulting from fraudulent entry or hacking into a computer system, and not voluntary transfers perpetuated by manipulation” while Medidata asserted that “the policy’s plain language defines data as ‘any information” in Medidata’s computer system.” On March 10, 2016, a New York federal judge refused both parties’ requests for summary judgment saying that there was not enough evidence to make a ruling. The fraudsters were never identified, and the transferred funds were never recovered. Neither side has filed any additional claims. [15] [16]
On March 15, 2017, the company's Japan subsidiary, Medidata Solutions K.K., was found to have wrongfully dismissed its Tokyo IT Director in 2015 after the company had asked him to fly from Tokyo to New York to receive the notice, which occurred weeks after he had filed two ethics reports on his boss for a nepotism hire and failure to address a security hole. The Tokyo District Court ruled that the company, which had sued the employee after he refused to voluntarily resign and was unilaterally dismissed, had not satisfied any of the four prerequisites from the Doctrine of Abusive Dismissal, which are necessary for a restructuring dismissal in Japan. As a result of the judgment, all back salary and bonuses in excess of 30 million yen were ordered to be paid, and the company has a legal obligation to continue to employee the man whose status as an employee was affirmed by the court. [17]
On January 26,2017, Medidata filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against five former VP level employees and Veeva Systems Inc. for breach of contract related to noncompete contract clauses and theft of trade secrets and confidential information. The complaint asserted that Veeva has been deliberately targeting Medidata employees, naming 11 junior level employees who had been hired by Veeva over the past two years as well as the unsuccessful solicitation of at least five additional senior level Medidata employees. The company is seeking injunctive relief and damages to be determined at trial. [18]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Legal Problems[edit]
On September 16, 2014, a Medidata accounting employee received an e-mail message that appeared to be from a company executive requesting a transfer of nearly $4.8 million to a bank account in China in regard to an acquisition. After receiving approval from two supervisors who also received similar e-mails, the money was transferred. When the transaction request was discovered to have been a fraud, Medidata filed an insurance claim, which was denied by its insurer, Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb Ltd. At issue was Federal Insurance’s claim that its policy only covered losses resulting from fraudulent entry or hacking into a computer system, and not voluntary transfers perpetuated by manipulation” while Medidata asserted that “the policy’s plain language defines data as ‘any information” in Medidata’s computer system.” On March 10, 2016, a New York federal judge refused both parties’ requests for summary judgment saying that there was not enough evidence to make a ruling. The fraudsters were never identified, and the transferred funds were never recovered. Neither side has filed any additional claims. [15] [16]
On March 15, 2017, the company's Japan subsidiary, Medidata Solutions K.K., was found to have wrongfully dismissed its Tokyo IT Director in 2015 after the company had asked him to fly from Tokyo to New York to receive the notice, which occurred weeks after he had filed two ethics reports on his boss for a nepotism hire and failure to address a security hole. The Tokyo District Court ruled that the company, which had sued the employee after he refused to voluntarily resign and was unilaterally dismissed, had not satisfied any of the four prerequisites from the Doctrine of Abusive Dismissal, which are necessary for a restructuring dismissal in Japan. As a result of the judgment, all back salary and bonuses in excess of 30 million yen were ordered to be paid, and the company has a legal obligation to continue to employee the man whose status as an employee was affirmed by the court. [17]
On January 26,2017, Medidata filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against five former VP level employees and Veeva Systems Inc. for breach of contract related to noncompete contract clauses and theft of trade secrets and confidential information. The complaint asserted that Veeva has been deliberately targeting Medidata employees, naming 11 junior level employees who had been hired by Veeva over the past two years as well as the unsuccessful solicitation of at least five additional senior level Medidata employees. The company is seeking injunctive relief and damages to be determined at trial. [18]

Legal Problems[edit]
On September 16, 2014, a Medidata accounting employee received an e-mail message that appeared to be from a company executive requesting a transfer of nearly $4.8 million to a bank account in China in regard to an acquisition. After receiving approval from two supervisors who also received similar e-mails, the money was transferred. When the transaction request was discovered to have been a fraud, Medidata filed an insurance claim, which was denied by its insurer, Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb Ltd. At issue was Federal Insurance’s claim that its policy only covered losses resulting from fraudulent entry or hacking into a computer system, and not voluntary transfers perpetuated by manipulation” while Medidata asserted that “the policy’s plain language defines data as ‘any information” in Medidata’s computer system.” On March 10, 2016, a New York federal judge refused both parties’ requests for summary judgment saying that there was not enough evidence to make a ruling. The fraudsters were never identified, and the transferred funds were never recovered. Neither side has filed any additional claims. [15] [16]
On March 15, 2017, the company's Japan subsidiary, Medidata Solutions K.K., was found to have wrongfully dismissed its Tokyo IT Director in 2015 after the company had asked him to fly from Tokyo to New York to receive the notice, which occurred weeks after he had filed two ethics reports on his boss for a nepotism hire and failure to address a security hole. The Tokyo District Court ruled that the company, which had sued the employee after he refused to voluntarily resign and was unilaterally dismissed, had not satisfied any of the four prerequisites from the Doctrine of Abusive Dismissal, which are necessary for a restructuring dismissal in Japan. As a result of the judgment, all back salary and bonuses in excess of 30 million yen were ordered to be paid, and the company has a legal obligation to continue to employee the man whose status as an employee was affirmed by the court. [17]
On January 26,2017, Medidata filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against five former VP level employees and Veeva Systems Inc. for breach of contract related to noncompete contract clauses and theft of trade secrets and confidential information. The complaint asserted that Veeva has been deliberately targeting Medidata employees, naming 11 junior level employees who had been hired by Veeva over the past two years as well as the unsuccessful solicitation of at least five additional senior level Medidata employees. The company is seeking injunctive relief and damages to be determined at trial. [18]

Legal Problems[edit]
On September 16, 2014, a Medidata accounting employee received an e-mail message that appeared to be from a company executive requesting a transfer of nearly $4.8 million to a bank account in China in regard to an acquisition. After receiving approval from two supervisors who also received similar e-mails, the money was transferred. When the transaction request was discovered to have been a fraud, Medidata filed an insurance claim, which was denied by its insurer, Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb Ltd. At issue was Federal Insurance’s claim that its policy only covered losses resulting from fraudulent entry or hacking into a computer system, and not voluntary transfers perpetuated by manipulation” while Medidata asserted that “the policy’s plain language defines data as ‘any information” in Medidata’s computer system.” On March 10, 2016, a New York federal judge refused both parties’ requests for summary judgment saying that there was not enough evidence to make a ruling. The fraudsters were never identified, and the transferred funds were never recovered. Neither side has filed any additional claims. [15] [16]
On March 15, 2017, the company's Japan subsidiary, Medidata Solutions K.K., was found to have wrongfully dismissed its Tokyo IT Director in 2015 after the company had asked him to fly from Tokyo to New York to receive the notice, which occurred weeks after he had filed two ethics reports on his boss for a nepotism hire and failure to address a security hole. The Tokyo District Court ruled that the company, which had sued the employee after he refused to voluntarily resign and was unilaterally dismissed, had not satisfied any of the four prerequisites from the Doctrine of Abusive Dismissal, which are necessary for a restructuring dismissal in Japan. As a result of the judgment, all back salary and bonuses in excess of 30 million yen were ordered to be paid, and the company has a legal obligation to continue to employee the man whose status as an employee was affirmed by the court. [17]
On January 26,2017, Medidata filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against five former VP level employees and Veeva Systems Inc. for breach of contract related to noncompete contract clauses and theft of trade secrets and confidential information. The complaint asserted that Veeva has been deliberately targeting Medidata employees, naming 11 junior level employees who had been hired by Veeva over the past two years as well as the unsuccessful solicitation of at least five additional senior level Medidata employees. The company is seeking injunctive relief and damages to be determined at trial. [18]
