HILARIOUS


                  He is honestly one of the nicest teachers I have ever had. He truly cares about his students. Although some of the assignments were confusing at first, if you ask him questions he will try different ways of explaining so you fully understand. Definitely would take him again!

                  Professor Murphy is an incredible teacher! Math has always been very difficult for me but he always made sure to make one on one time with me every week to help me understand and give me the confidence I needed. He's also a teacher that cares about your well being not just your academics

                  You can not say enough good things about Dr. Murphey. Not only will he make sure you understand the material he is teaching, he will also help you if you have questions with material from other math courses. I've had him for my first and third semesters of Calc and I regret not having for the second. I  learn much more in his classes!

                  Dr. Murphy gives amazing lectures and really cares about his students. As far as math teachers goes he has been one of my favorites. If anyone is  going for a degree that is math heavy I would highly recommend Dr. Murphy.

SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS.


                  Phenomenal professor. I'm far from being "good" at anything dealing with math but because of Professor Murphy, I learned an incredible amount in his classes. I feel that if anyone else taught the classes he taught, I would not have learned as much.

RESPECTED


                  Mr. Murphy is an excellent teacher. If you ever have questions, he is often available in his office or around campus. Also responds quickly to emails. He genuinely cares for his students. Lets you make corrections on tests if you do the homework. Take his classes whenever you can!!

CARING
RESPECTED
GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK


                  He is very passionate about math. He made class enjoyable and fun to be in. He is very friendly and will be there to help during office hours if need be. He takes what is most talked about in class for the exams, so going to class helps. I would take any class with him as a teacher.

                  This was probably my favorite class here. He's such a nice guy and goes over any questions you  may have until you fully understand the concept. He makes jokes every now and then and is very understanding if you have to miss a test or quiz. He's the best for any upper level math class!

                  The class is extremely time consuming. You cannot afford to skip any classes because he holds everyone accountable for the material he teaches. He is willing to help during his office hours.
