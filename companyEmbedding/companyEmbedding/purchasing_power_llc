BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 07/13/2007
            

                BBB has determined that Purchasing Power, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

We make paying for purchases stress- and hassle-free. Just meet the minimum qualifications through our participating employers or organizations, and enjoy the convenience of automatic payments without the penalty fees and ballooning interest associated with other payment options. 




 No Overspending Individual spending limits based on salary and tenure Transparent TransactionUpfront price, no hidden costs 



 Automated DeductionsManageable payments, 12-month terms and no interest OwnershipReceive purchases up front, pay off in one year. 





I love Purchasing Power. The name says it all. PurchasingPower.com gives you the power to purchase items you may want or need for a extremely reasonable price. Two thumbs up to everyone involved in the Purchasing Power customer experience process. Quality products and super fast delivery of purchases was extraordinary.
Dominic, September 2014






 



We offer a better way to buy
When cash isn’t an option, we can help you get what you need and get it when you need it. And we make it simple:
No credit check — Everyone who meets the eligibility requirements are qualified.Register — Sign up at the Purchasing Power website at any time and view our online catalog.Shop — Find items like computers and tablets, appliances, educational services and vacation packages.Order — See the total price up front and how much will be deducted from each paycheck over a 12-month period.Pay over time — Orders are quickly sent to your home and payments are automatically deducted from your paycheck - it’s that simple. 





This program was a blessing. Our family needed a new home computer system however could not afford to buy one without having to purchase it on credit. This allows me to pay make payments without high interest.
Rebecca, September 2014
