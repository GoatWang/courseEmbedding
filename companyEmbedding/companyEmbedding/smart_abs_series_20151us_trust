3.4
Late payment   


 
(a)
(Late payments to be paid in accordance with this Agreement): If:   


 
(i)
any payment under Clause 3.1 is received by a Paying Agent late but otherwise on the Distribution Date on which it was required to be received and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that Paying Agent
will, on that Distribution Date, make the payments required to be made by it in respect of the US$ Notes as provided in this Clause 3 (other than Clause 3.4(a)(ii)), unless such payment is not received by the Paying Agent in sufficient time to
permit it to do so (as determined by the Paying Agent (acting reasonably)), in which case the Paying Agent will, make the payments required to be made by it in respect of the US$ Notes as provided in this Clause 3 (other than Clause 3.4(a)(ii)) as
soon as possible after receipt; and   


 
(ii)
any payment under Clause 3.1 is received by a Paying Agent late and not on the Distribution Date on which it was required to be received, but otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that Paying

funds by the Issuer) on demand promptly reimburse each other Paying Agent for payments of principal and interest properly made by that Paying Agent in accordance with the US$ Note Conditions and this Agreement. The Issuer will not be responsible for
the apportionment of any moneys between the Principal Paying Agent and the other Paying Agents and a payment to the Principal Paying Agent of any moneys due to the Paying Agents will operate as a good discharge to the Issuer in respect of such
moneys.   


3.8
Payment under Currency Swap  The payment by the Issuer of its Australian dollar payment
obligations under the Series Supplement on each Distribution Date to the Currency Swap Provider in relation to a Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes will be a good discharge of its US$ obligations under Clause 3.1 for that Class or Sub-Class of US$
Notes (but will not relieve the Issuer of any liability in respect of any default in payment in respect of a US$ Note under any other Transaction Document). The Principal Paying Agent must notify the Issuer and the Currency Swap Provider in writing

(b)

in all cases and for all purposes, despite any notice to the contrary, and will not be liable for so doing. 
 


3.12
Repayment of moneys   


 
(a)
(Prescription): Immediately on any entitlement to receive principal or interest under any US$ Note becoming void under the US$ Note Conditions, the Principal Paying Agent will repay to the Issuer the amount

Paying Agent holds funds on trust  Each Paying Agent will hold on trust for the US$ Note

US$ Note Trust Deed or the US$ Note Conditions or repaid under Clause 3.12. For so long as a Paying Agent holds any such amounts, those amounts must not be commingled with the relevant Paying Agents own funds or any other funds held by the
relevant Paying Agent and all such amounts must be held by the relevant Paying Agent in a segregated account. Such segregated account shall be established at the Principal Paying Agent by the Manager in the name of the Series Trust. The Manager on
behalf of the Series Trust shall provide the applicable IRS Form(s) to the Principal Paying Agent to permit the Principal Paying Agent to make payments hereunder without deduction or withholding of United States federal income or similar taxes.

(c)
(Deliver): promptly deliver to the US$ Note Registrar any US$ Notes surrendered to it pursuant to Condition 8.2 of the US$ Note Conditions.

made or not made.

date of that change) give to the US$ Noteholders notice in accordance with Condition 11.1 of the US$ Note Conditions of that change and of the address of the new Specified Office, but the cost of giving that notice must be borne by the Agent which
is changing its Specified Office and not by the Issuer or the Manager.

12.
MISCELLANEOUS DUTIES AND PROTECTION   


12.1
Agents are agents of the Issuer   


 
(a)
(Agent of the Series Trust): Subject to Clause 6.1, each Agent is the agent of the Issuer in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust only. 
 


 
(b)
(Issuer not responsible for Agents): Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or at law, the Issuer in its personal capacity is not responsible for
any act or omission of any Agent.   


12.2
Agency  Subject to any other provision of this Agreement, each Agent acts solely for and
as agent of the Issuer and does not have any obligations towards or relationship of agency or trust with any person entitled to receive payments of principal and/or interest on the US$ Notes and is responsible only for the performance of the duties
and obligations imposed on it pursuant to this Agreement.   


12.3
Reliance  Each Agent is protected from and will incur no liability for or in respect of
any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in reliance upon any instruction, request or order from the Issuer or the Manager or in reliance upon any US$ Note or upon any notice, resolution, direction, consent, certificate, affidavit, statement or
other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been delivered, signed or sent by the proper party or parties.   


12.4
Entitled to deal  An Agent is not precluded from acquiring, holding or dealing in any
US$ Notes or from engaging or being interested in any contract or other financial or other transaction with the Issuer or the Manager as freely as if it were not an agent of the Issuer under this Agreement and in no event whatsoever (other than
fraud, wilful default or negligence) will any Agent be liable to account to the Issuer or any person entitled to receive amounts of principal or interest on the US$ Notes for any profit made or fees or commissions received in connection with this
agreement or any US$ Notes.   


12.5
Consultation and delegation   


 
(a)
(Consultation): Each Agent may, if reasonably necessary or prudent, consult with lawyers or other professional advisers selected by it, who may be employees of or lawyers or advisers to the Issuer, the
Manager or the relevant Agent and it will not be responsible to any person for any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in reliance upon the advice of such adviser or for any acts, omissions, fraud, misconduct, or default on the part of any
person consulted by it under this Clause 12.5(a), provided that it has exercised good faith and due care in ensuring that the person consulted by it is appropriately qualified to give such advice. 
 


 
(b)
(Delegation): An Agent may whenever it thinks it expedient in the interests of the US$ Noteholders, delegate:   


 
(i)
to a Related Body Corporate of that Agent, all or any of the duties, powers, authorities, trusts and discretions vested in that Agent by this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents; and 
  21 




 
(ii)
to any person agreed to by the Manager, any non-material part of the duties, powers, authorities, trusts and discretions vested in that Agent by this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents. 
Any such delegation may be by power of attorney or in such other manner as the Agent may think fit and may be made upon such terms and
conditions (including power to subdelegate) and subject to such regulations as the Agent may think fit. Provided that the Agent has exercised good faith and due care in the selection of such delegate, and subject to Clause 12.5(c), it will not be
under any obligation to any person to supervise the proceedings or be in any way responsible for any loss incurred by reason of any acts, omissions, fraud, misconduct or default on the part of any such delegate or subdelegate. 
 


 
(c)
(Related Body Corporate): Where, pursuant to Clause 12.5(b), an Agent delegates any of its trusts, duties, powers, authorities and discretions to any person who is a Related Body Corporate of it, that
Agent at all times remains liable for the acts or omissions of such Related Body Corporate if that act or omission would be a breach of this Agreement had it been an act or omission of that Agent and it is caused by the fraud, negligence or wilful
default of such Related Body Corporate and for the payment of fees of that Related Body Corporate when acting as delegate.   


12.6
Duties and obligations  Each Agent will perform the duties and obligations, and only the
duties and obligations, contained in or reasonably incidental to this Agreement and the US$ Note Conditions and no implied duties or obligations (other than general laws as to agency) will be read into this Agreement or the US$ Note Conditions
against any Agent. An Agent is not required to take any action under this Agreement which would require it to incur any expense or liability for which (in its reasonable opinion) either it would not be reimbursed within a reasonable time or in
respect of which it has not been indemnified to its satisfaction.   


12.7
Income tax returns  Subject to having received all documents which it is entitled to
receive under Clause 12.9, the Principal Paying Agent will, on request by a US$ Noteholder, deliver to that US$ Noteholder such information as may be reasonably required to enable such US$ Noteholder to prepare its income tax returns. 
 


12.8
Representation by each Agent  Each Agent represents and warrants that: 
 


 
(a)
(Qualified): it is duly qualified to assume its obligations under this Agreement and has obtained all necessary approvals required to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement; and
  


 
(b)
(Legal proceedings): there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or to the best of the knowledge of an Authorised Officer of the Agent, threatened against the Agent before any court or any
governmental authority which, if determined adversely to it, would materially and adversely, affect its ability, either in its individual capacity or as the Agent, as the case may be, to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  22 




12.9
Information and forms  The Issuer and the Manager each severally covenants in favour of
each Agent that it will, following a request by an Agent, promptly provide to that Agent, as that Agent may reasonably require to enable it to perform its duties and functions under this Agreement, such information, forms and other documents that
are in the possession of the Issuer or the Manager, as the case may be, or which it is otherwise entitled to obtain from any person.   


12.10
Notices  A copy of all communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
between the Issuer, the Manager, the US$ Note Trustee or the US$ Noteholders and any of the Paying Agents (other than the Principal Paying Agent) shall be sent to the Principal Paying Agent by the relevant Paying Agent. 
 


12.11
Liability of Principal Paying Agent or Paying Agent  Neither the Principal Paying Agent
nor any other Paying Agent will be liable if it is unable to carry out its duties and obligations due to any breach of any person (other than that Principal Paying Agent or Paying Agent) of its obligations under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any failure of receipt of any necessary instructions, notices, documents or information from any party or any situation not within its control. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Agent will only be
liable to the Issuer for the Issuers direct damage when caused by that Agents fraud, negligence or wilful misconduct.   


12.12
Confidentiality  Each Agent will treat information relating to the Issuer as
confidential, but (unless consent is prohibited by law) the Issuer consents to the transfer and disclosure by the Agent of any information relating to the Issuer to and between branches, subsidiaries, representative offices, affiliates and agents of
each Agent and third party auditors or legal counsel selected by any of them, to the extent that such recipients need to know the information, wherever situated, for confidential use (including in connection with the provision of any service and for
data processing, statistical and risk analysis purposes) provided that any of such recipients of the information also agree to be subject to the same duty of confidentiality as provided herein. Each Agent and any branch, subsidiary, representative
office, affiliate, agent or third party may transfer and disclose any such information as required by any law, court regulator or legal process.   


12.13
Conflicts of interest  The Issuer hereby irrevocably waives, in favour of the Agents,
any conflict of interest which may arise by virtue of each Agent acting under this Agreement or for other customers of such Agent. The Issuer acknowledges that the Agents and their respective affiliates may have interests in, or may be providing or
may in the future provide financial or other services to other parties with interests which the Issuer may regard as conflicting with its interests and may possess information (whether or not material to the Issuer), other than as a result of the
Agents acting hereunder, that such Agent may not be entitled to share with the Issuer. None of the Agents will use (without the Issuers consent) confidential information obtained from the Issuer to any of the Agents other customers nor
will any Agent use confidential information to the Issuer which such Agent has obtained from any of its other customers. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Issuer agrees that the Agents and their respective affiliates may deal in (whether for
their own or their respective customers accounts) or advise on securities of any party and that such dealing or advising, will not constitute a conflict of interest for the purposes of this Agreement. 
  23 




13.
EXPENSES   


13.1
Payment of expenses  The Issuer (as directed by the Manager) must pay or reimburse to
each Agent all reasonable costs, expenses, charges, stamp duties and other Taxes and liabilities reasonably and properly incurred by that Agent in the performance of the obligations of that Agent under this Agreement including all costs and expenses
(including legal costs and expenses) incurred by that Agent in the enforcement of any obligations under this Agreement. Nothing in this Clause 13.1 entitles or permits an Agent to be reimbursed or indemnified for general overhead costs and expenses
(including rents and any amounts payable by that Agent to its employees in connection with their employment) incurred directly or indirectly in connection with the business activities of that Agent or in the exercise of its rights, powers and
discretions or the performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement. For the purposes of clause 13.1(b) of the Master Security Trust Deed, any moneys payable to an Agent under this Clause 13.1 are to be considered as that Agents
remuneration.  The Issuer will also pay to each Agent the fees as agreed, on or before the Closing Date, in writing between the
Issuer, the Manager and that Agent. The Manager must notify each Rating Agency of each such fee.   


13.2
No other fees  Except as provided in Clause 13.1, or as expressly provided elsewhere in
this Agreement, neither the Issuer nor the Manager has any liability in respect of any fees or expenses of any Agent in connection with this Agreement.   


13.3
Payment of fees  The above payments and expenses will be paid in Australian dollars. The
Issuer will in addition pay any value added tax which may be applicable.

No commission  Subject to this Clause 13, no Paying Agent may charge any commission or
fee in relation to any payment by it under this Agreement.   


13.5
Timing of payments  All payments by the Issuer to an Agent under this Clause 13 are
payable on the first Distribution Date following demand by that Agent from funds available for this purpose in accordance with the Series Supplement.   


14.

ISSUERS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY   


15.1
Limitation on Issuers liability  This Agreement applies to the Issuer only in its
capacity as trustee of the Series Trust and in no other capacity. A liability incurred by the Issuer acting in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust arising under or in connection with this Agreement is limited to and can be enforced against
the Issuer only to the extent to which it can be satisfied out of the Assets of the Series Trust out of which the Issuer is actually indemnified for the liability. This limitation of the Issuers liability applies despite any other provision of
this Agreement (other than Clause 15.3) and extends to all liabilities and obligations of the Issuer in any way connected with any representation, warranty, conduct, omission, agreement or transaction related to this Agreement. 
 


15.2
Claims against Issuer  The parties other than the Issuer may not sue the Issuer in
respect of any liabilities incurred by the Issuer acting in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust in any capacity other than as trustee of the Series Trust including seeking the appointment of a receiver (except in relation to the Assets of
the Series Trust) a liquidator, an administrator or any similar person to the Issuer or prove in any liquidation, administration or similar arrangements of or affecting the Issuer (except in relation to the Assets of the Series Trust). 
 


15.3
Fraud, negligence or wilful default  The provisions of this Clause 15 will not apply to
any obligation or liability of the Issuer to the extent that it is not satisfied because under the Master Trust Deed, the Series Supplement or any other Transaction Document in relation to the Series Trust or by operation of law there is a reduction
in the extent of the Issuers indemnification out of the Assets of the Series Trust as a result of the 
  27 



Issuers fraud, negligence or wilful default and will not apply to any obligation or liability of the Issuer to pay amounts from its personal funds. 
 


15.4
Acts or omissions  It is acknowledged that the Relevant Parties are responsible under
the Transaction Documents for performing a variety of obligations relating to the Series Trust. No act or omission of the Issuer (including any related failure to satisfy its obligations or any breach of representations or warranties under this
Agreement) will be considered fraudulent, negligent or a wilful default for the purposes of Clause 15.3 to the extent to which the act or omission was caused or contributed to by any failure by any Relevant Party or any other person appointed by the
Issuer under any Transaction Document (other than a person whose acts or omissions the Issuer is liable for in accordance with any Transaction Document) to fulfil its obligations relating to the Series Trust or by any other act or omission of a
Relevant Party or any other such person.   


15.5
No authority  No Agent appointed in accordance with this Agreement has authority to act
on behalf of the Issuer in a way which exposes the Issuer to any personal liability and no act or omission of any such person will be considered fraudulent, negligent or wilful default of the Issuer for the purposes of Clause 15.3. 
 


15.6
No obligation  The Issuer is not obliged to enter into any commitment or obligation
under or in relation to this Agreement or any Transaction Document (including incur any further liability) unless the Issuers liability is limited in a manner which is consistent with this Clause 15 or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the
Issuer in its absolute discretion.   


16.
GENERAL   


16.1
Waiver  A failure to exercise or enforce or a delay in exercising or enforcing or the
partial exercise or enforcement of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement by a party will not in any way preclude or operate as a waiver of any further exercise or enforcement of such right, remedy, power or privilege of the
exercise or enforcement of any other right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement or provided by law.   


16.2
Written waiver, consent and approval and specimen signatures   


 
(a)
(Waiver, consent and approval): Any waiver, consent or approval given by a party under this Agreement will only be effective and will only bind that party if it is given in writing, or given verbally and
subsequently confirmed in writing, and executed by that party or on its behalf by two Authorised Officers of that party.   


 
(b)
(Specimen signatures): On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Issuer must provide to the Principal Paying Agent a certified copy of a list setting out in full the name and specimen signature of

  28 




16.3

any jurisdiction is ineffective in such jurisdiction to the extent only of such illegality, voidness or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement. 
 


16.4
Survival of indemnities  The indemnities contained in this Agreement are continuing, and
survive the termination of this Agreement.   


16.5
Assignments  No party may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties and without the Manager first issuing a Rating Notification in relation to the proposed assignment or transfer. 
 


16.6
Successors and assigns  This Agreement is binding upon and enures to the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   


16.7
Moratorium legislation  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the provisions of all
statutes whether existing now or in the future operating directly or indirectly:   


 
(a)
(To affect obligations): to lessen or otherwise to vary or affect in favour of any party any obligation under this Agreement; or 
 


 
(b)
(To affect rights): to delay or otherwise prevent or prejudicially affect the exercise of any rights or remedies conferred on a party under this Agreement, 
are hereby expressly waived, negatived and excluded.   


16.8
Amendments  This Agreement may be amended only by written agreement between all parties
to this Agreement, provided that the Manager and the Trustee may only agree to such amendment in accordance with the provisions of clause 25 of the Master Trust Deed and for this purpose references in that clause to a Series Supplement will be taken
to be references to this Agreement.   


16.9
Governing law  This Agreement is governed by and must be construed in accordance with
the laws applying in the Australian Capital Territory.   


16.10
Jurisdiction  Each party irrevocably and unconditionally: 
 


 
(a)
(Submissions to jurisdiction): submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Australian Capital Territory; 
  29 




 
(b)
(Waiver of inconvenient forum): waives any objection it may now or in the future have to the bringing of proceedings in those courts and any claim that any proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient
forum; and   


 
(c)
(Service of notice): agrees, without preventing any other mode of service permitted by law, that any document required to be served in any proceedings may be served in the manner in which notices and other
written communications may be given under Clause 14.   


16.11
Counterparts  This Agreement may be executed in a number of counterparts and all such
counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same instrument.   


16.12
Limitation of US$ Note Trustees liability  Clause 8.3 of the US$ Note Trust Deed
is incorporated into this Agreement as if set out in full and for this purpose references in that clause to this Deed and Clause 8.3 will be taken to be references to this Agreement and Clause 16.12
respectively.   


16.13
Contra proferentem  Each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted without
disadvantage to the party who (or whose representative) drafted that provision.   


16.14
Anti-money laundering  Each party (the Information Provider) agrees to provide
any information and documents reasonably required by any other party (the Information Recipient) to comply with any applicable anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism financing laws including any applicable laws imposing know your
customer or other identification checks or procedures that the Information Recipient is required to comply with in respect of this Agreement (AML/CTF Laws), but the foregoing obligation applies only to the extent that such information
and such documents are in the possession of the Information Provider or may be obtained by it after having undertaken reasonable steps and subject to any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations owed by the Information Provider to any
person in relation to whom the information or documents requested relate (except, in all cases, to the extent that the foregoing may be overridden by the relevant AML/CTF Laws). Each party must comply with any AML/CTF Laws applicable to it, to the
extent required to comply with its obligations under the Transaction Documents. Any party may decline to perform any obligation under the Transaction Documents to the extent it forms the view, in its reasonable opinion, that notwithstanding that it
has taken all action to comply with any applicable AML/CTF Laws, it is required to decline to perform those obligations under any such AML/CTF Laws. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each party and the Noteholders and Unitholders release each
other party (a Released Party) from any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations that a Released Party would otherwise owe to it in respect of this Agreement and to the extent to which it is able, any applicable confidentiality and
privacy laws, but only to the extent that the existence of these obligations or laws would otherwise prevent a Released Party from providing any information or documents requested in accordance with this Clause 16.14 or any similar clause in any
other Transaction Document.   


16.15
Compliance with Regulation AB   


 
(a)
 In relation to each fiscal year of the Series Trust (which commences on 1 April of each calendar year) for which MLPL is required under the
Exchange Act to file an annual report on Form 10-K with respect to the Series Trust, the Principal Paying Agent, the US$ Note 
  30 




 

Registrar and the Agent Bank (the Assessing Party) must prepare and deliver to each of the Issuer, MLPL, the Manager, the US$ Note Trustee and the Rating Agencies, each of the following items no
later than 90 days after the end of that fiscal year:   


 
(i)
(Assessment of compliance): as required under Rules 13a-18 and 15d-18 of the Exchange Act and Item 1122 of Regulation AB, a report regarding the Assessing Partys assessment of compliance with
the Servicing Criteria, including disclosure of any material instance of non-compliance identified by the Assessing Party. Such report must be signed by an Authorised Officer of the Assessing Party, and must be substantially in the form of Schedule
1 and address (A) each of the Servicing Criteria marked in Appendix A to Schedule 1 as Applicable Servicing Criteria and (B) any unmarked Servicing Criteria in Appendix A to Schedule 1, to the extent that the Assessing Party is
involved in servicing activities relating to such Servicing Criteria, as mutually agreed upon by MLPL and such Assessing Party from time to time;   


 
(ii)
(Accounting attestation report): a report of a registered public accounting firm that attests to, and reports on, the assessment of compliance report made by the Assessing Party and delivered pursuant to,
Clause 16.15(a)(i). Such attestation must be in accordance with Rules 1-02(a)(3) and 2-02(g) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and   


 
(iii)
(Delegate information): a written description of the role and function of each delegate appointed by the Assessing Party that performs one or more discrete functions identified in Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB with respect to the SMART Receivables, specifying: (A) the identity of each such delegate and which (if any) of such delegates are participating in the servicing function within the meaning of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB; and (B) which elements of the Servicing Criteria will be addressed in assessments of compliance provided by each delegate identified pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Clause 16.15(a)(iii). 
 


 
(b)
As a condition to the utilisation of any delegate determined to be participating in the servicing function within the meaning of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, the Assessing Party shall cause each such
delegate, if any, to comply with Clause 16.15(a)(i) and Clause 16.15(a)(ii) as if references to the Assessing Party in those Clauses were references to such delegate, except that any assessment of compliance or accounting reports delivered by a
delegate of the Assessing Party under Clause 16.15(a)(i) or Clause 16.15(a)(ii) need not address any elements of the Servicing Criteria other than those specified by the Assessing Party to such delegate pursuant to Clause 16.15(a)(iii)(B).
  


 
(c)
Each Assessing Party represents, warrants and agrees that each report required pursuant to this Clause 16.15 to be provided by the Assessing Party or any of its delegates will be accurate in all material respects and
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
  


 
(d)
Any failure by the Assessing Party or any delegate of the Assessing Party to deliver any information, report, certification, accountants letter or other material when and as required under this Clause 16.15, shall
immediately and automatically, without notice or grace period, entitle the Manager, in its sole discretion:   


 
(i)
 to remove the Assessing Party or direct the Assessing Party to remove such delegate from the performance of any activities which MLPL reasonably
determines to 
  31 




 

constitute participating in the servicing function in relation to the Issuer within the meaning of Item 1122 of Regulation AB; and 
 


 
(ii)
to replace the Assessing Party or such delegate with respect to such activities;  provided
that, if directed by MLPL, the Manager shall so remove and replace the Assessing Party or such delegate, as applicable; and provided, further, that to the extent that any provision of the Transaction Documents expressly provides for the
survival of certain rights or obligations following termination of such party, such provision shall be given effect.

(a)

ABN 26 003 435 443 and Permanent Custodians Limited ACN 001 426 384, the rights and obligations of which were assumed by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited ABN 42 000 001 007 pursuant to the Deed of Assumption, as amended and supplemented from time
to time and a Trust Creation Deed (the Trust Creation Deed) dated [] executed by the Trustee.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6Historia tego ratingu kredytowego odzwierciedla dokładnie aktualny stan wskaźnika (sf), ale ze względu na ograniczenia techniczne nie odzwierciedla dokładnie historii wskaźnika (sf). Zapraszamy do odwiedzenia zakładki “Research” aby zobaczyć artykuły prasowe, które zostały opublikowane, gdy wskaźnik (sf) został dodany lub usunięty.


        ​W odniesieniu do ratingów kredytowych określonych wyłącznie w oparciu o istniejący rating kredytowy programu, serii czy kategorii/klasy długu, podmiotu wspierającego lub podmiotu głównego o nadanym ratingu, a także w odniesieniu do ratingu, który zastępuje rating tymczasowy wcześniej przypisany na tym samym poziomie, Moody’s publikuje ogłoszone oceny ratingowe odnoszące się do danej serii czy kategorii/klasy długu, bądź całości programu, podmiotu wspierającego lub podmiotu głównego o nadanym ratingu, bądź dot. ratingu tymczasowego, podczas gdy w wielu przypadkach nie publikuje określonej oceny ratingowej każdej kolejnej emisji obligacji czy krótkoterminowych papierów dłużnych, w odniesieniu do których rating kredytowy jest pochodną istniejącego ratingu kredytowego. Ogłoszenia ratingów to z reguły komunikaty dla prasy klasyfikowane jako decyzje ratingowe (Rating Actions) ukazujące się na www.moodys.com. Ogłoszenia ratingu należy szukać na stronie Emitenta/Podmiotu w zakładce Analiz (Research).

Comparison with the pricing of the earlier deal is not relevant, given that a large part of Smart ABS Series 2015-1US Trust was issued in US dollars. However, pricing on the A notes issued in Smart ABS Series 2014-4 Trust last November, which also had a weighted average life of two years, was 72 bps over the swap rate.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
