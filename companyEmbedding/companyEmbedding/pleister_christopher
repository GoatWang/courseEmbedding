      (NYSE:GF) (each, a “Fund,” and, collectively, the “Funds”) announced

      With respect to CEE, each of the three Class II Directors nominated by 
      the Board of Directors, Ambassador Richard R. Burt, Mr. Walter C.

      Christopher Pleister, was elected to serve a term of two years and until

      CEE did not receive sufficient votes to approve the proposals (i) to 
      change the Fund’s investment objective from seeking “long-term capital 
      appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked 
      securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey” to 
      seeking “long-term capital appreciation through investment primarily in 
      equity and equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled in Central and 
      Eastern Europe;” and to change the Fund’s corresponding fundamental 
      investment policy to provide that, “[u]nder normal circumstances, the 
      Fund will invest at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets (plus borrowings 
      used for investment purposes) in securities of issuers domiciled in 
      Central and Eastern Europe;” and (ii) to change the Fund’s fundamental 
      investment policies to require the Fund to invest more than 25% of its 
      total assets in the securities of issuers in the energy sector 
      Therefore, the meeting was adjourned to Tuesday, July 25, 2017 at 11.30

      EEA Class II Director nominated by the Board of Directors, Dr. 
      Christopher Pleister, was elected to serve a term of two years and until 
      his successor is elected and qualifies.
    

      EEA did not receive sufficient votes to approve the proposed change to 
      the Fund’s investment objective from seeking “long-term capital 
      appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked 
      securities of issuers domiciled in countries that are members of the 
      European Union” to seeking “long-term capital appreciation through 
      investment primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers 
      domiciled in countries in Europe;” and a change in the Fund’s 
      corresponding fundamental investment policy to provide that, “[u]nder 
      normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund's net assets (plus any 
      assets funded with leverage) will be invested in equity or equity-linked 
      securities of issuers domiciled in countries in Europe.” Therefore, the 
      meeting was adjourned to Friday, June 30, 2017 at 11:30 a.m. at the

Important Information


The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. is a 
      non-diversified, closed-end investment company seeking long term capital 
      appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked 
      securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey. 
      Because the Fund is non-diversified, it can take larger positions in 
      fewer issuers than a diversified fund, increasing its potential risk.


The European Equity Fund, Inc. is a diversified, closed-end 
      investment company seeking long-term capital appreciation through 
      investment primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers 
      domiciled in countries that are members of the European Union.


The New Germany Fund, Inc. is a diversified, closed-end investment 
      company seeking capital appreciation primarily through investment in 
      equity or equity-linked securities of small and mid-cap German companies.
The Fund may invest up to 35% of its assets in large cap German 
      companies and up to 20% in non-German companies (with no more than 15% 
      in any single country).


Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging 
      markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, 
      political and economic changes, and market risks. Any fund that 
      concentrates in a particular segment of the market or a particular 
      region will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more 
      broadly.


The shares of most closed-end funds, including the Funds, are not 
      continuously offered. Once issued, shares of closed-end funds are 
      bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares 
      of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. 
      The price of a fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, 
      several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, a 
      fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below, or above 
      net asset value.


Investments in funds involve risk. Additional risks of the Fund are 
      associated with international investing, such as currency fluctuations, 
      political and economic changes, market risks, government regulations and 
      differences in liquidity, which may increase the volatility of your 
      investment. Foreign security markets generally exhibit greater 
      price volatility and are less liquid than the US market. Additionally, 
      the Fund focuses its investments in certain geographical regions, 
      thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in those regions 
      and potentially subjecting the Funds’ shares to greater price volatility.
Some funds have more risk than others. These include funds, 
      such as the Funds, that allow exposure to or otherwise concentrate 
      investments in certain sectors, geographic regions, security types, 
      market capitalization, or foreign securities (e.g., political or 
      economic instability, which can be accentuated in emerging market 
      countries).


The European Union, the United States and other countries have 
      imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of the Russian military 
      intervention in the Ukraine. These sanctions have adversely 
      affected Russian individuals, Russian issuers and the Russian economy. 
      Russia, in turn, has imposed sanctions targeting Western individuals, 
      businesses and products, including food products. The various 
      sanctions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, 
      not only the Russian economy, but also the economies of many countries 
      in Europe, including Germany and other countries in Central Europe. Potential 
      developments in the Ukraine, and the continuation of current sanctions, 
      or the imposition of additional sanctions, may materially adversely 
      affect the value of the Funds’ portfolios.


This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in 
      any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale 
      would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws 
      of such state or jurisdiction.


Certain statements contained in this release may be forward-looking 
      in nature. These include all statements relating to plans, 
      expectations, and other statements that are not historical facts 
      and typically use words like “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” 
      “intend,” and similar expressions. Such statements represent 
      management’s current beliefs, based upon information available at the
time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed.
All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such 
      statements. Management does not undertake any obligation to 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a 
      result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Waifs & Strays vs PBR Streetgang - See Me Now 8. Rhythm Operator - Truth 9. Edit Murphy - Maybe One Day We Can Be Friends 10. Schmutz - Lies 11. John Barera - True to YourselfRelease Info: After last year’s successful ‘Deep Love 10’ compilation Dirt Crew now bring yet another massive collection of exclusive tracks by label residents and new faces. ‘Deep Love 15’ is packed with outstanding new releases that vary from the deep grounds of house to the underground sides of techno and disco. Releasing the entire 16 tracks across a five-track EP and bonus 11 track CD (sold as one New Release Information product) the compilation splits and stretches itself across all formats. The five vinyl tracks are all more towards the deep house side. Funk and soul laden grooves with main house heads ‘Brame & Hamo’ and ‘Nachtbraker’ starting off on the A-side, both tracks showing their signature sound written all over. The third track is by label newbies ‘Homework’ from Amsterdam who Dirt Crew know from their great outings on ‘Exploited’ and most recently ‘Let’s Play House’, as well as studio neighbours of ‘Detroit Swindle’ and kind of part of the family already. The B-side is by the UK act ‘Voyeur’ who made a good name for themselves already with their release on Kerri Chandler’s ‘Madhouse’ label. Their track ‘The Long Way Home’ is truly one of the highlights of this compilation, with it’s jazzy and classic sounding house approach. To close off we have the Berlin based Spanish brothers ‘Kyodai’ taking over, with a true journey of a track they go way deep into the house and techno regions, instant goosebumps when you hear this on a big system! Over to the CD, the music covers all genres and it was a challenge to fit them all together in one nice package. We start off with a couple of new heads, on the first tracks. ‘Laurence Guy’ teamed up with ‘Harry Wolfman’, both from the UK and both on Dirt Crew HQ’s watch list for quite a while, they make that great mix of funky and jazzy sounds with a hint of disco. Next is the mysterious ‘Soul of Hex’ from Mexico who just recently released their first 12” (one member here is ‘Sebastien Vorhaus’ who just released an EP on Dirt Crew together with ‘Ponty Mython’). We also have ‘Loz Goddard’ among these first few tracks, he will be doing a full EP later this year with ‘Harry Wolfmann’ on Dirt Crew - so a lot of collaborations coming up between all these guys. One thing they all have in common is a very fresh twist to the current house genre. ‘Kito Jempere’, ‘Downtown Party Network’ and ‘Waifs & Strays vs PBR Streetgang’ need no introduction. All have made brilliant releases over the last few years and all have one thing in common, a love for disco and deep grooves, ‘Kito’ of course is the jazz man here, his crazy twists and unique sounds make all of his tracks very special. The American side of the Dirt Crew family is also represented by LA based ‘Edit Murphy’ and ‘Rhythm Operator’. Both have a very old schoolish approach to their music and both tracks could well have come from an obscure early 90s Chicago twelve. Having made an excellent album last year on Steffi’s ‘Dolly’ imprint with ‘Will Martin’, Bostonian ‘John Barrera’ closes the CD with a blistering Detroit techno cut. Lastly DC of course had to feature a track by Belfast lads ‘Schmutz’ who released their first EP on Dirt Crew in January. Their unique dark twisting techno sound is just like no other, distorted but always with that warm underground house feeling to it. So there we have it. Deep Love 15. 16 brand new and exclusive tracks across three formats, showcasing just where Dirt Crew is in 2015. Keepin’ it underground!

The Central Europe, Russia And Turkey Fund, Inc., The European Equity Fund, Inc., And The New Germany Fund, Inc. Announce Changes To Board Membership






Business Wire




Oct 21, 2016 5:00 PM EDT













 




























































  The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. (NYSE:CEE), The European Equity Fund, Inc. (NYSE:EEA), and The New Germany Fund, Inc. (NYSE:GF) (each, a "Fund," and, collectively, the "Funds") announced today the following changes to the membership of each Fund's respective Board of Directors:   Dr. Christopher Pleister was appointed as a Class II Director of CEE, a Class II Director of EEA and a Class III Director of GF effective October 21, 2016;   Dr. Friedbert Malt will retire as a Class II Director of CEE and a Class III Director of GF effective as of October 24, 2016; and   Mr. Detlef Bierbaum will retire as a Class I Director of CEE effective as of October 24, 2016.    Dr. Pleister has extensive experience in financial services. Since 2015 he has served as a non-executive director and as Chairman of the Audit Committee of Depfa Bank plc. and as a member of the Appeal Panel of the Single Resolution Board, Brussels (the resolution authority within the European Banking Union). He is the former Chairman of the German Federal Agency for Financial Market Stabilization, the National Association of German Cooperative Banks, and Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank AG.  For more information on the Funds, including their most recent month-end performance, visit deutschefunds.com or call (800) 349-4281 or 00-800-2287-2750 from outside the US.  Important Information  The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company seeking long term capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey. Because the Fund is non-diversified, it can take larger positions in fewer issues, increasing its potential risk.  The European Equity Fund, Inc. is a diversified, closed-end investment company seeking long-term capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled in countries that are members of the European Union.  The New Germany Fund, Inc. is a diversified, closed-end investment company seeking capital appreciation primarily through investment in equity or equity-linked securities of small and mid-cap German companies. The Fund may invest up to 35% of its assets in large cap German companies and up to 20% in other non-German companies.  The shares of most closed-end funds, including the Funds, are not continuously offered. Once issued, shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of a fund's shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, a fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below, or above net asset value.  Investments in funds involve risk. Additional risks of the Funds are associated with international investing, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, market risks, government regulations and differences in liquidity, which may increase the volatility of your investment. Foreign security markets generally exhibit greater price volatility and are less liquid than the US market. Additionally, the Funds focus their investments in certain geographical regions, thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in that region and potentially subjecting the Funds' shares to greater price volatility. Some funds have more risk than others. These include funds, such as the Funds, that allow exposure to or otherwise concentrate investments in certain sectors, geographic regions, security types, market capitalization, or foreign securities (e.g., political or economic instability, which can be accentuated in emerging market countries).  The European Union, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of the Russian military intervention in the Ukraine. These sanctions have adversely affected Russian individuals, issuers and the Russian economy, and Russia, in turn, has imposed sanctions targeting Western individuals, businesses and products, including food products. The various sanctions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, not only the Russian economy, but also the economies of many countries in Europe, including Germany. Potential developments in the Ukraine, and the continuation of current sanctions or the imposition of additional sanctions may materially adversely affect the value of the Funds' portfolios.  This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction.  NOT FDIC/ NCUA INSURED • MAY LOSE VALUE • NO BANK GUARANTEE  NOT A DEPOSIT • NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY  Deutsche Asset Management represents the asset management and wealth management activities conducted by Deutsche Bank AG or any of its subsidiaries. Clients will be provided Deutsche Asset Management products or services by one or more legal entities that will be identified to clients pursuant to the contracts, agreements, offering materials or other documentation relevant to such products or services.
