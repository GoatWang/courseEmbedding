 





>> Welcome to Premium Coaching - Introducing Dr. Jean Hauser <<
 














              Jean has over twenty-five years of experience in executive development and organizational effectiveness. She was Director of the Center for Custom Programs at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, as well as a faculty member. Under her leadership the center was rated number one worldwide in a Business Week survey of university-based executive education.
Dr. Hauser also served as the Assistant Dean for Executive Education at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. She worked with faculty and staff to help move Duke into the forefront of custom designed executive programs. As the cornerstone of her work at UNC and Duke, Jean was the principal investigator in numerous system-wide organizational assessments. These assessments provided the feedback for designing custom programs for clients including Bank of America, Kaiser Permanente, US Postal Service, Cargill, Eli Lilly, Bethlehem Steel, and other multi-national corporations. A Johnson & Johnson assessment in close partnership with J&J resulted in the blueprint for the design of their world class manufacturing program. A later assessment resulted in J&J’s program for CFO’s, delivered worldwide.
After a successful career in academia, Jean served as a Senior Vice President for The Concours Group, an international consulting firm, where she was involved in research and organizational development consulting. She specialized in coaching senior executives, talent management, executive bench strength, and organizational assessment. In that role she managed numerous client relationships.
A large part of Jean’s professional interest and nationally recognized expertise has centered in the techniques of “action learning.” This is a process by which individuals and/or teams move from dialogue and knowledge building to specific measurable behaviors. This process helps answer the question, “So what are we going to do to make a difference?” It helps focus individuals and/or teams on the specific outcomes necessary to achieve substantial and sustainable changes in behavior.

Product Review: Endress+Hauser Micropilot FMR10 

Level
Product Review






































Created by  Fabrício Andrade   on Jan 12, 2017

Micropilot FMR10
Endress+Hauser launched a new level transmitter, the new Micropilot FMR10! We’re here to judge the features and the benefits, so enjoy the review and decide what you think!
Courtesy of Endress+Hauser
Whatcha got there?
Endress+Hauser offers the radar Micropilot FMR10 with the idea of providing new tech at a similar price to your old ultrasonic level device.
Before we start the review, I wanna squeeze in a word on the Endress+Hauser website. Its quiet “modern design” lacks a primary point of usability. By that I mean I couldn’t use my smartphone to access the device information on the site! #Whereisthemanual?
Back to the device. I daresay it’s the smallest radar I’ve ever seen. Be careful! You may lose the device just going out to the field! Just kidding. It comes with protection ratings IP66 and IP68, a range of up to 8 meters and an accuracy around 5 millimeters.
As a low-cost analog device, it can’t support many features for your Plant Asset Management (PAM) system because you don’t have HART protocol built-in! Furthermore, if you want a display, you have to get an external option with a RIA15 to show the process information to the operator.
What can it do?
Endress+Hauser seems to want to focus on the price point, which appeals to a lot of end users. Radar offers more advantages than ultrasonic, and now that the prices almost match, why not try it?
The FMR10 offers a good compact design. And bonus, it’s not plain black! It even has a bit of color! Of course that doesn’t really matter, but I had to comment on it. #applepointofview
Sadly, it lacks wireless communication to connect with the control system. On the other hand, it does have a Bluetooth connection so you can access the device remotely and check your data.
You can download the SmartBlue app at the App Store and Google Play. And best of all, it costs nothing to use and test! We like companies tossing in software for free. Thanks, mates!
Why should I care?
If you’re considering an ultrasonic level transmitter, consider the FMR10 too. It costs almost the same yet gives you better technology and fancier features, improving the quality of the level measurement and your work conditions. Hey, you gotta enjoy it, right?
On the down side, the display costs extra. But come on. With Bluetooth access, do you really need a display? #modernity
When I downloaded the app onto my smartphone, I had to wonder: How can you have a nice app with good design and a website that needs a manual to use? 
I really like the app, the envelope curve makes up for it, though. The procedure to save and send it by email is simple, but the demo mode could use some clarity. It took me a while to figure out how to turn it off.
In fact, the whole design is simple, but at the same time kinda elegant! Yeah, I said elegant. The Smartblue app offers a good experience overall.
In general, I like the FMR10, although I long for something disruptive from Endress+Hauser!
