WHO WE ARE?






Our Story: 1962 to Present
Our company was founded in 1962 by George R. Roberts. George was an excavating contractor who wanted to grow his business by installing Septic Tanks.
As his business grew, he found that Septic Tanks were not always available when needed, so rather than relying on someone else and working around their schedule, he decided to begin making them himself. This “side” business of manufacturing and delivering precast concrete Septic Tanks soon outgrew the excavating business, so he began making Septic Tanks on a full-time basis.
The business grew through the 60’s, 70’s and early 80’s by specializing in residential and light-commercial concrete products. Up to that point in time, the shop was located on Federal Street in Alfred, Maine, adjacent to the Roberts home.
In 1984 George and his wife, Gladys, decided that the company had outgrown its original facility and moved the business to its current location on Route 111 in Alfred.
In 1985 the Company was purchased by Allan Martin and William Nichols. Al and Bill’s mission was to grow the company into a regional leader in the Precast Concrete Industry.
Under the daily leadership of Al Martin, the company expanded into the commercial market by adding manholes and catch basins, commercial septic tanks, sewage pumping stations and utility products. The company grew at a tremendous rate during this time, mirroring the regional construction industries growth. In 1997, the Company expanded into the precast step business. The Step Guys have become an integral part of the Company’s product mix experiencing steady growth year after year.
After guiding the Company’s growth for 21 years, Al Martin retired from on-site activity in 2006. At that time, Al promoted longtime employee, Tim Cook to President of the Company. Under Tim’s direction the company continued to grow and in 2013 a new 8,600 square foot production building was built. The new building houses two 25 ton overhead bridge cranes, doubling the previous lifting capacity at the George Roberts Company. In January of 2015, after 9 years at the helm of George Roberts and 21 years overall, Tim decided to leave the Company for an opportunity much closer to home. So Al selected Steve Ray, a 10-year employee of the Company and a 30-year precast concrete veteran, to take over as President of the George Roberts.
After more than 50 years in business, the George R. Roberts Company strives to be a key partner with all of its customers. Our emphasis on customer support, prompt service and quality products has allowed us to develop and maintain many long term relationships with customers throughout New England, and to make Al and Bill’s vision in 1985 a reality.

Early life[edit]
George Roberts was born into a Jewish[2] family in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1962 and received that institution's "Man of the Year" Award in 1998. He attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating in 1966, and the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, graduating in 1969.[3]
Career[edit]
Roberts worked for Bear Stearns in the late 1960s and early 1970s becoming a partner at the age of 29.[2] While at Bear Stearns, Roberts, alongside Kohlberg and Kravis, began a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments. Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.[4]
By 1976, tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and the trio of Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities.[5] Early investors in KKR included Henry Hillman[6] By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising the first institutional fund with investor commitments.[7]
He has an estimated net worth of around $5.5 billion as of 2007[update].[8] Much of this wealth came through his position at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In 1989 Roberts and Kravis led one of the most famous leveraged buyouts (LBOs) in the takeover of RJR Nabisco. Roberts' involvement in the RJR Nabisco deal was profiled prominently in the book and movie, Barbarians at the Gate.[9] Roberts was featured on the cover of FORTUNE Magazine at the height of the buyout boom of the 1980s alongside his cousin and partner, Henry Kravis.
Personal life[edit]
In 1968, he married Leanne Bovet, daughter of Eric B. Bovet and Dorothy Champion of San Mateo, California.[10][11] Leanne's father was a member of the Swiss Borel family of San Mateo being the son of Swiss immigrant Louis Bovet and Grace Borel (the daughter of the family patriarch, Swiss immigrant Antoine Borel, a prominent banker in San Mateo, California).[12][13] She died in 2003.[14] The couple had three children, Eric, Mark and Courtney.
On May 22, 2010, he married Goldman Sachs partner Linnea Conrad.[15]
Philanthropic and public positions[edit]
Roberts is the founder and chairman of the boards of directors of non-profit organizations such as the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund that focuses on job creation.[16] He also serves as a trustee of Claremont McKenna College and Culver Military Academy, and is a board member of San Francisco Symphony, San Francisco Ballet, and the Fine Arts Museum.[17] In 2012, he gave $50 million to Claremont McKenna College.[18]

Early life[edit]
George Roberts was born into a Jewish[2] family in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1962 and received that institution's "Man of the Year" Award in 1998. He attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating in 1966, and the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, graduating in 1969.[3]
Career[edit]
Roberts worked for Bear Stearns in the late 1960s and early 1970s becoming a partner at the age of 29.[2] While at Bear Stearns, Roberts, alongside Kohlberg and Kravis, began a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments. Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.[4]
By 1976, tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and the trio of Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities.[5] Early investors in KKR included Henry Hillman[6] By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising the first institutional fund with investor commitments.[7]
He has an estimated net worth of around $5.5 billion as of 2007[update].[8] Much of this wealth came through his position at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In 1989 Roberts and Kravis led one of the most famous leveraged buyouts (LBOs) in the takeover of RJR Nabisco. Roberts' involvement in the RJR Nabisco deal was profiled prominently in the book and movie, Barbarians at the Gate.[9] Roberts was featured on the cover of FORTUNE Magazine at the height of the buyout boom of the 1980s alongside his cousin and partner, Henry Kravis.
Personal life[edit]
In 1968, he married Leanne Bovet, daughter of Eric B. Bovet and Dorothy Champion of San Mateo, California.[10][11] Leanne's father was a member of the Swiss Borel family of San Mateo being the son of Swiss immigrant Louis Bovet and Grace Borel (the daughter of the family patriarch, Swiss immigrant Antoine Borel, a prominent banker in San Mateo, California).[12][13] She died in 2003.[14] The couple had three children, Eric, Mark and Courtney.
On May 22, 2010, he married Goldman Sachs partner Linnea Conrad.[15]
Philanthropic and public positions[edit]
Roberts is the founder and chairman of the boards of directors of non-profit organizations such as the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund that focuses on job creation.[16] He also serves as a trustee of Claremont McKenna College and Culver Military Academy, and is a board member of San Francisco Symphony, San Francisco Ballet, and the Fine Arts Museum.[17] In 2012, he gave $50 million to Claremont McKenna College.[18]

Speed Information



Site Ping Time Comment : This is the time to get a reply from the server that's hosting the website measured by the time it takes for a packet of data to travel to the server and back.
                                    Longer ping times indicate that the server is located further away in terms of hops, which are transit nodes, and usually corresponds to its physical distance from the pinging computer.
                                    However many websites have caches (or copies) across various global locations that can result in shorter ping times.
                                
                                    A shorter ping time is one of the factors of a website's responsiveness.

Early life[edit]
George Roberts was born into a Jewish[2] family in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1962 and received that institution's "Man of the Year" Award in 1998. He attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating in 1966, and the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, graduating in 1969.[3]
Career[edit]
Roberts worked for Bear Stearns in the late 1960s and early 1970s becoming a partner at the age of 29.[2] While at Bear Stearns, Roberts, alongside Kohlberg and Kravis, began a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments. Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.[4]
By 1976, tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and the trio of Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities.[5] Early investors in KKR included Henry Hillman[6] By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising the first institutional fund with investor commitments.[7]
He has an estimated net worth of around $5.5 billion as of 2007[update].[8] Much of this wealth came through his position at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In 1989 Roberts and Kravis led one of the most famous leveraged buyouts (LBOs) in the takeover of RJR Nabisco. Roberts' involvement in the RJR Nabisco deal was profiled prominently in the book and movie, Barbarians at the Gate.[9] Roberts was featured on the cover of FORTUNE Magazine at the height of the buyout boom of the 1980s alongside his cousin and partner, Henry Kravis.
Personal life[edit]
In 1968, he married Leanne Bovet, daughter of Eric B. Bovet and Dorothy Champion of San Mateo, California.[10][11] Leanne's father was a member of the Swiss Borel family of San Mateo being the son of Swiss immigrant Louis Bovet and Grace Borel (the daughter of the family patriarch, Swiss immigrant Antoine Borel, a prominent banker in San Mateo, California).[12][13] She died in 2003.[14] The couple had three children, Eric, Mark and Courtney.
On May 22, 2010, he married Goldman Sachs partner Linnea Conrad.[15]
Philanthropic and public positions[edit]
Roberts is the founder and chairman of the boards of directors of non-profit organizations such as the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund that focuses on job creation.[16] He also serves as a trustee of Claremont McKenna College and Culver Military Academy, and is a board member of San Francisco Symphony, San Francisco Ballet, and the Fine Arts Museum.[17] In 2012, he gave $50 million to Claremont McKenna College.[18]

Early life[edit]
George Roberts was born into a Jewish[2] family in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1962 and received that institution's "Man of the Year" Award in 1998. He attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating in 1966, and the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, graduating in 1969.[3]
Career[edit]
Roberts worked for Bear Stearns in the late 1960s and early 1970s becoming a partner at the age of 29.[2] While at Bear Stearns, Roberts, alongside Kohlberg and Kravis, began a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments. Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.[4]
By 1976, tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and the trio of Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities.[5] Early investors in KKR included Henry Hillman[6] By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising the first institutional fund with investor commitments.[7]
He has an estimated net worth of around $5.5 billion as of 2007[update].[8] Much of this wealth came through his position at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In 1989 Roberts and Kravis led one of the most famous leveraged buyouts (LBOs) in the takeover of RJR Nabisco. Roberts' involvement in the RJR Nabisco deal was profiled prominently in the book and movie, Barbarians at the Gate.[9] Roberts was featured on the cover of FORTUNE Magazine at the height of the buyout boom of the 1980s alongside his cousin and partner, Henry Kravis.
Personal life[edit]
In 1968, he married Leanne Bovet, daughter of Eric B. Bovet and Dorothy Champion of San Mateo, California.[10][11] Leanne's father was a member of the Swiss Borel family of San Mateo being the son of Swiss immigrant Louis Bovet and Grace Borel (the daughter of the family patriarch, Swiss immigrant Antoine Borel, a prominent banker in San Mateo, California).[12][13] She died in 2003.[14] The couple had three children, Eric, Mark and Courtney.
On May 22, 2010, he married Goldman Sachs partner Linnea Conrad.[15]
Philanthropic and public positions[edit]
Roberts is the founder and chairman of the boards of directors of non-profit organizations such as the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund that focuses on job creation.[16] He also serves as a trustee of Claremont McKenna College and Culver Military Academy, and is a board member of San Francisco Symphony, San Francisco Ballet, and the Fine Arts Museum.[17] In 2012, he gave $50 million to Claremont McKenna College.[18]

George R. Roberts ’66 P’93 — CMC Trustee, Philanthropist, and Co-Founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. — Announced as 2013 Commencement Speaker







      Claremont McKenna College (CMC) has announced that Trustee and financier 
      George R. Roberts ’66 P’93, Co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. 
      (KKR) and its co-chairman and co-chief executive officer, will 
      deliver the keynote address at the College’s 66th Annual 
      Commencement ceremonies set for 2 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. The 
      ceremony, honoring the Class of 2013, will be held on Pritzlaff Field, 
      south of Bauer Center.

      A generous champion of his undergraduate alma mater, Roberts’ name is 
      entwined with daily life at CMC, including the conclusion last March of 
      the George R. Roberts Faculty Challenge. The gift-matching measure, 
      launched in 2006, was the largest gift in the history of the College for 
      direct faculty support, and raised a total of $60 million to build, 
      support, and strengthen the College’s academic environment with 
      exceptional scholars committed to teaching and research. Faculty members 
      who received an endowed chair under the Roberts Faculty Leadership 
      Initiative are designated as George R. Roberts Fellows.
    
      Within the same year that the Challenge reached its successful 
      conclusion, Roberts then gave an unrestricted gift of $50 million to the 
      College, which pushed the College past its $600 million Campaign for 
      Claremont McKenna goal. Announced in December 2012, his unrestricted 
      gift led the Board of Trustees to designate in his honor a 
      state-of-the-art new fitness and athletics facility as the Roberts 
      Pavilion.
    
      “Claremont McKenna College is honored to welcome George Roberts as this 
      year’s keynote speaker,” said Pamela Gann, president of the College. 
      “For me, personally, having George Roberts serve as our speaker at my 
      last Commencement as president is most gratifying. He is the embodiment 
      of all that CMC values. Simply put, George Roberts exemplifies visionary 
      and transformative leadership.”
    
      A pioneer of the private equity industry, George Roberts co-founded 
      Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in 1976. For more than 30 years, along 
      with KKR co-founder and CMC Trustee Henry R. Kravis ’67, he has led the 
      firm in its growth into a leading global alternative asset manager.
    
      He is actively involved in managing the firm and serves on each of the 
      regional Private Equity Investment and Portfolio Management committees. 
      Roberts also has served as a director or trustee of several cultural and 
      educational institutions, including Claremont McKenna College. In 
      addition to his generous philanthropy at CMC, he is the founder and 
      chairman of the board of directors of the Roberts Enterprise Development 
      Fund (REDF), a San Francisco-based venture philanthropy organization 
      that creates jobs and employment opportunities for people facing the 
      greatest barriers to work. REDF provides equity-like grants and business 
      assistance to a portfolio of nonprofits in California to start and 
      expand social enterprises — nonprofit-operated businesses selling goods 
      and services demanded by the marketplace, while intentionally employing 
      young people and adults who would otherwise face bleak prospects of ever 
      getting a job.
    
      Roberts earned his bachelor’s degree from Claremont McKenna College in 
      1966, and a J.D. from the University of California (Hastings) Law School 
      in 1969. He has more than four decades of experience financing, 
      analyzing, and investing in public and private companies, as well as 
      serving on the boards of a number of KKR portfolio companies.
    
      His philanthropy already touches many facets of the College’s life. In 
      addition to the extraordinary Roberts faculty fundraising challenge and 
      his unrestricted gift to the Campaign, Roberts has also supported 
      construction of two academic buildings — Roberts North and 
      Roberts South, which house classrooms and faculty offices — as 
      well as the founding of the Roberts Environmental Center.
    
      Claremont McKenna College (CMC) is an independent, coeducational liberal 
      arts college. Established in 1946, CMC is a member of The Claremont 
      Colleges, a consortium of seven independent institutions in Claremont, 
      California.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
