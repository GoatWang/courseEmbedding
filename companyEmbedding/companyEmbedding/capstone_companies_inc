Power Failure Products
Capstone’s Power Failure Solutions are powered by advanced technology rechargeable batteries and LED bulbs that never need replacing. The products employ a stylish industrial design approach, separating them from many other off-the-shelf imported products. Capstone’s signature power failure feature is engineered with proprietary circuitry that allows its products to turn on when the power goes out.  When not protecting consumers in a power failure situation, the products have various multi-function applications such as becoming a flashlight, work light, nightlight or decorative sconce light. Product price points are targeted at key consumer/ retailer thresholds, using a competitive, value added pricing strategy. As global warming, accidental human error and the aging of the power grid continue to escalate and create more power outages, more often, the company believes that consumers and retailers alike will be more proactive in power failure preparedness.  The latest addition to this product portfolio is Capstone’s Power Failure Bulb incorporating CPC technology, patented on August 23, 2016.





Safety & Security Products
Capstone’s Safety & Security products address a need for simple, affordable and effective security lighting devices.  The company believes that many people are leaving themselves open to certain risks in and around their homes or while traveling. Capstone’s current security products include a wireless motion detectors that automatically light up interior or exterior areas when the motion sensor is triggered.  As with Power Failure, Capstone is strategically committed to developing an innovative line of security solutions that address today’s and tomorrow’s challenges for personal / family security and safety.

Consumer Solutions









Capstone Industries
In 2008 Capstone Industries launched its first power failure product under the Eco-i-Lite sub brand. This new multi-function product used a lithium ion rechargeable battery and LED bulb technology to ensure reliability and long product life. With several million Eco-i-Lites having been sold, this proven technology has been expanded to seven new power failure applications as the line has grown into a category. Each product is engineered to turn on when the power goes out, providing consumers with needed protection against more frequent power outages. While being prepared for a power failure is extremely important, Capstone’s multi-functional products are equally valuable for day-to-day use as flashlights, work lights, night lights and decorative wall lighting.
Two of Capstone Industries latest product introductions are the beginning of a new Safety & Security category providing consumers with a higher level of privacy and protection. The Door Security Monitor and Motion Detector Light are ideal examples of product applications that provide solutions to improve everyday consumer security.

Strategy






CORPORATE STRATEGY
Our corporate mission is to develop and maintain positions of innovation and technical leadership by continually introducing new ideas and concepts to our consumer product categories, while maintaining competitive value pricing.  Leveraging our product successes and expanding sales channels is key as our brands continue to gain traction at retail by merchandisers, buyers and consumers.  Toward that end, the company completed a re-branding effort for its Capstone branded product that enhances its image further and is more reflective of its unique product innovations and technology advancements.
In 2012 the Company executed a strategy to further nourish the company’s product development endeavors.  The company made an investment in AC Kinetics, Inc., to confidentially explore and develop certain inventive concepts the company has conceived. These concepts are typically very complex and will yield intellectual property which will further distance the companies’ products from off–the-shelf products commonly marketed at retail. (Read more about AC Kinetics)
The company plans to maximize its proprietary technologies through select licensing arrangements and considers selective acquisitions or investments in businesses with superior technology / product development capabilities – or that could benefit from our leadership capabilities and strategic direction.

      amended. Such statements consist of words like “anticipate,” 
      “expect,” “project,” “continue” and similar words. These 
      statements are based on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ current 
      expectations and involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause 
      results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking 
      statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ

      Companies, Inc., which is a small business concern and a "penny-stock 
      Company” and, as such, a highly risky investment suitable for only those

      Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission. Capstone Companies, Inc. undertakes no obligation to 
      publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a

Capstone Companies, Inc. Raises First Quarter 2017 Revenue Expectations to $5.5 million | Business Wire
























































Capstone Companies, Inc. Raises First Quarter 2017 Revenue 
      Expectations to $5.5 million





Updated first quarter 2017 revenue expectation to $5.5 million, 
        up from prior guidance of an estimated $4.1 million


Fourth consecutive “record” quarter performance


Strong backlog continues for orders of new products to be 
        available at retail in Q1 & Q2 2017







April 25, 2017 06:55 AM Eastern Daylight Time



DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Capstone Companies, Inc. (OTC: CAPC) (“Capstone” or the “Company”), a 
      designer of innovative LED lighting solutions including power failure 
      lighting, today raised its revenue guidance for the 2017 first quarter 
      to $5.5 million. The increases in guidance provided today are based on 
      increased presence of the Company’s product on store shelves of its 
      large U.S. retailers, higher customer demand for the Company’s products 
      and strong reorder activity that is driving growing backlog.
    


      Stewart Wallach, Capstone’s CEO, commented, “Our 2017 Q1 revenue 
      expectations further validate the momentum our Company is experiencing. 
      At the close of Q1, we will have had four consecutive record quarters 
      yielding trailing 12 month revenues of an estimated $34.5 million. 
      Importantly, the Company backlog continues to grow and remain strong 
      supporting Q2 and Q3.”
    

      He added, “Sales and marketing have reported strong product placement 
      and Q1 includes the shipments of five new product entries for 2017.”
    

      Additionally Larry Sloven, President of Capstone International Hong Kong 
      reports, “The Company has received orders from two leading home 
      improvement retailers in the Pacific Rim that furthers the Company’s 
      international reach. This new distribution falls on the heels of record 
      international sales in 2016.”

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:


This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as that term 
      is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as 
      amended. Such statements consist of words like “anticipate,” 
      “expect,” “project,” “continue” and similar words. These 
      statements are based on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ current 
      expectations and involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause 
      results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking 
      statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, 
      include consumer acceptance of the Company’s products, its ability to 
      deliver new products, the success of its strategy to broaden market 
      channels and the relationships it has with retailers and distributors.
Prior success in operations does not necessarily mean success in 
      future operations. The ability of the Company to adequately and 
      affordably fund operations and any growth will be critical to achieving 
      and sustaining any expansion of markets and revenue. The 
      introduction of new products or the expanded availability of products 
      does not mean that the Company will enjoy better financial or business 
      performance. The risks associated with any investment in Capstone 
      Companies, Inc., which is a small business concern and a "penny-stock 
      Company” and, as such, a highly risky investment suitable for only those 
      who can afford to lose such investment, should be evaluated together 
      with the risks and uncertainties more fully described in the Company’s 
      Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission. Capstone Companies, Inc. undertakes no obligation to 
      publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a 
      result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Contents 
      of referenced URLs are not incorporated into this press release.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
