Job Details
               We are a research-based biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and licensing of novel disease-modifying therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of rare neurodegenerative, "orphan", diseases with high unmet medical need. Our internal drug discovery programs are focused on therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates. We have a strong track record of executing successful license agreements with leading pharmaceutical companies. As an example, we licensed a naturally derived, small molecule, potent antioxidant to Shire Plc ("Shire"), which recently tested the drug candidate in patients with Freidreich's Ataxia, a rare, hereditary disorder that leads to progressive and irreversible damage to the nervous system. We are entitled to substantial future payments upon achievement of certain milestones by Shire and significant royalties from sales upon approval of the drug by the US FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies. Friedreich's Ataxia affects an estimated 1 in 30,000 to 50,000 people in the United States and a similar number in ex-US countries. Our global patent estate, which includes 85 issued patents spanning composition of matter and methods of use of various compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. tauopathies and proteinopathies), protects our proprietary interest in novel antioxidants, amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies, tau monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and related platform technologies.

New Energy Appoints Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Elliot M. Maza, JD, CPA.










Columbia, MD – February 4, 2011 – New Energy Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: NENE), a developer of renewable and alternative energy technologies, is pleased to announce the appointment of its Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Elliot M. Maza, who brings more than 25 years of corporate finance, regulatory compliance, accounting, and legal expertise to the Company.
Mr. Elliot M. Maza, JD, CPA Chief Financial Officer New Energy Technologies, Inc.
Notably, Mr. Maza served as Partner, Transaction Advisory Services at Ernst & Young LLP, New York, NY, and previously as Vice President, Structured Finance at the New York, NY offices of both Goldman Sachs & Co and JP Morgan Securities, Inc. Early in his career, Mr. Maza tenured as Tax and Corporate Attorney at Sullivan & Cromwell, a 130 year old global law firm. At their New York, NY offices, he advised multinational corporations and investment banks on tax consequences of equity, debt and derivative structures as well as domestic and cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions.
Mr. Maza received his B.A. degree from Touro College in New York and his J.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He is a licensed C.P.A. in the states of New Jersey and New York and is a member of the New York and New Jersey State Bar.
Mr. Maza joins New Energy as Chief Financial Officer, on a non-exclusive basis and, in addition to other appointments, continues to serve on the Board of Directors and is Chairman of the Audit Committee of a publicly-traded company, Chinese miner, refiner and producer of high purity tellurium (Te) and other metals for the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. He has served on the Board of Directors, and was previously Chairman of the Audit Committee, of several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Mr. Maza also actively serves at a publicly-traded biotechnology company, where among other achievements, he has secured and successfully executed multiple financing transactions, and consummated intellectual property licenses with numerous global pharmaceutical companies.
“I’m honored to welcome Mr. Maza to our team, as part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen the Company’s management team in preparation for the commercialization of our core technologies,” stated Mr. John Conklin, President and CEO of New Energy Technologies, Inc. “Recently, we’ve worked hard to build our management group, following several technical breakthroughs with important commercial benefits for both our SolarWindow™ and MotionPower™ technologies.”
Mr. Maza’s appointment follows the recent addition of Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Andrew T. Farago, JD, who brings 16 years of investment, hedge fund, and legal experience in renewable and alternative energy experience. He is credited with helping grow assets under management from $20 million to over $800 million during his tenure at RNK Capital, LLC, a New York based investment management company, exclusively focused on energy, clean-tech, and the trading of environmental credits. In addition to operations and finance, Mr. Farago has negotiated and structured the purchase and sale of Renewal Energy Credits (RECs) with total notional value exceeding $40 million. Mr. Farago is a licensed attorney admitted to practice law in the State of New York, and was previously FINRA Series 7, 63, 55, and 24 licensed. Mr. Farago holds a B.A. in psychology from Syracuse University and a JD from Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center.
Last week, the Company also announced important additions to its Scientific Advisory Board, including the appointment of Dr. Steven S. Hegedus, to assist with development of New Energy’s SolarWindow™, capable of generating electricity on see-thru glass windows.
Dr. Hegedus is a Research Scientist at the Institute of Energy Conversion (IEC) at the University of Delaware, the world’s oldest photovoltaic research laboratory. Dr. Hegedus is credited with more than 90 scientific publications related to thin film solar cell fabrication, characterization, manufacturing methods and reliability studies, and has played an active role in the development of numerous solar cell technologies, which have subsequently been commercialized. Dr. Hegedus received a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 1977, a Masters in Electrical Engineering from Cornell University, and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Delaware.
The Company also appointed Mr. Jerry Lynch, PE, to its Scientific Advisory Board, to assist with the development of its MotionPower™ technologies for generating electricity from the motion of cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles.
Mr. Jerry Lynch is a licensed professional engineer in NY and NJ, and has authored numerous articles on design and industrial manufacturing. He has been certified by NIST as a LEAN Manufacturing Expert and has helped over 20 firms develop smart manufacturing methods and approaches. Mr. Lynch has been responsible for the design and successful launch of hundreds of innovative technical new products, and brings significant international experience on major projects in Abu Dhabi, UAE, France, Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and Spain. Over the past 7 years he has personally been involved in four pilot projects in the renewable energy sector, specifically in solar and hydrokinetic power generation. Mr. Lynch has a BS in Engineering from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, a MS in Business Management from Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ.
 




About SolarWindow Technologies, Inc.



 SolarWindow Technologies, Inc. is a developer of next generation, transparent electricity-generating SolarWindow™ coatings.
SolarWindow™ coatings generate electricity on see-through glass and flexible plastics with colored tints popular to skyscraper glass. Unlike conventional systems, SolarWindow™ can be applied to all four sides of tall towers, generating electricity using natural and artificial light conditions and even shaded areas. SolarWindow™ uses organic materials, which are dissolved into liquid, ideal for low-cost high-output manufacturing; and is the subject of a patent pending technology.
The company’s Proprietary Power Production & Financial Model (Power & Financial Model) uses photovoltaic (PV) modeling calculations that are consistent with renewable energy practitioner standards for assessing, evaluating and estimating renewable energy for a PV project. The Power & Financial Model estimator takes into consideration building geographic location, solar radiation for flat-plate collectors (SolarWindow™ irradiance is derated to account for 360 degree building orientation and vertical installation), climate zone energy use and generalized skyscraper building characteristics when estimating PV power and energy production, and carbon dioxide equivalents. Actual power, energy production and carbon dioxide equivalents modeled may vary based upon building-to-building situational characteristics and varying installation methodologies.

(the “company” or “SolarWindow Technologies”) believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements and the assumptions upon which they are based are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations and assumptions will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” or “project” or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. The reader is cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as these statements are subject to numerous factors and uncertainties, including but not limited to adverse economic conditions, intense competition, lack of meaningful research results, entry of new competitors and products, adverse federal, state and local government regulation, inadequate capital, unexpected costs and operating deficits, increases in general and administrative costs, termination of contracts or agreements, technological obsolescence of the company's products, technical problems with the company's research and products, price increases for supplies and components, litigation and administrative proceedings involving the company, the possible acquisition of new businesses or technologies that result in operating losses or that do not perform as anticipated, unanticipated losses, the possible fluctuation and volatility of the company's operating results, financial condition and stock price, losses incurred in litigating and settling cases, dilution in the company's ownership of its business, adverse publicity and news coverage, inability to carry out research, development and commercialization plans, loss or retirement of key executives and research scientists, changes in interest rates, inflationary factors, and other specific risks. There can be no assurance that further research and development will validate and support the results of our preliminary research and studies. Further, there can be no assurance that the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained or that SolarWindow Technologies, Inc. will be able to develop commercially viable products on the basis of its technologies. In addition, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports and filings may be inspected and copied at the Public Reference Room maintained by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

The Amazon Textbooks Store allows you to shop online and buy all your textbooks without ever leaving the comfort of your couch. We offer a variety of new, used, rental, and eTextbooks. Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student. Get your textbooks delivered to your door and save both time and money by shopping at Amazon.com. So go ahead and treat yourself to that designer purse or new video game, you can since you’ve saved so much on your textbooks.

Students may be eligible for a tax exemption on textbooks in some states. Learn More.

eTextbook Studying Features
Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
