Why Primus?Trusted Partner



Management centric investment strategy. We invest in companies run by experienced managers and engage through our role on the boards of directors.
We win together. We align interests and foster decision making between management and Primus. Through equity ownership, we help ensure meaningful value creation in our companies.
Consistent support. Most companies don’t follow a straight path to value creation. We have a history of working constructively with our management teams to address the challenges of growing a business.



Experience in Building Value



Experience and industry focus create knowledge. We understand emerging industry trends, competitive threats and acquisition and exit opportunities. We apply this experience and knowledge in working with management to maximize value and achieve liquidity.
You run the company. We help you succeed. We make available the resources of our firm and its network of business relationships to management to help grow your company more rapidly and profitably. We assist management teams with strategic analysis, such as extending product or service lines, entering new geographies and evaluating and acquiring complementary businesses.



The Right Deal For You



Transaction structure that meets your needs. We take a flexible approach to structuring our investments and can tailor a transaction to meet your specific needs.  We make both minority and control equity investments and use prudent financial leverage to enhance equity returns where appropriate.
Access to capital. In addition to our capital under management, we maintain an extensive network of lenders and equity co-investors that provides access to additional capital that may be required to fund your transaction.
Speed to close. We have a successful track record of completing transactions that require timely responses, complicated negotiations and creative approaches
