               Company: Hour Exchange Portland
Job Details
               Hour Exchange Portland provides a unique way to gain experience and expertise as well as expand an entrepreneur's client base, providing access to our Portland area members. Participating in Hour Exchange does not exclude you from participating in the money market economy, it's complimentary to it, many businesses use Hour Exchange for some visits or portion of their time, which has allowed them to keep busy engaging and expanding and be better positioned to come out ahead as the economy improves. Hour Exchange strengthens local community relationships which strengthens the community's economy in general. Our members provide hundreds of services in all walks of life, anything from office cleaning to accounting or computer support, services that can be especially useful for any business with limited financial capital. So, you are a volunteer organization? Not in the conventional sense. We believe in Reciprocity (it's one of our core values), not in separating providers and receivers. We all have needs, but we all have value and something valuable to offer the community. Rather than asking "How can I help you?", we ask "How can we help each other build the world we both want to live in? By working together, we accomplish so much more. So you are like barter? No. Barter is trading, based on cash value, between two people. We are a non-profit 501c3 service exchange organization. Our currency is based on time, with no relation to market value and it is not a direct trade between two people. If an Hour Exchange member gives an hour of their time they can receive an hour of anyone else's time within the Hour Exchange member community. And unlike barter the IRS has determined that exchanging time is non-taxable! For info on our Programs and Partnerships click here.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."
