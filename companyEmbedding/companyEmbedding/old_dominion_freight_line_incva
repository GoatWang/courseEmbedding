At Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. we offer benefit programs
					that help our employees stay healthy, meet their financial goals,
					develop their careers, and balance the demands of work and personal
					life. We are committed to our employees’ health, safety and
					wellness because it is the right thing to do. We recognize that
					your needs will vary throughout your career and our benefits
					provide the flexibility to tailor our options to your stage in
					life. Benefit eligibility varies according to employment status.

Your Health
The OD health insurance program provides medical, dental and
					vision insurance coverage which is both comprehensive and
					affordable. The medical insurance program offers a choice between
					two preferred provider organization (PPO) plan options that can be
					used nationwide. Coverage for eligible employees will begin after
					60 days of employment. OD pays approximately 80% of the cost for
					our employees’ medical coverage. The National Survey of
					Empower-Sponsored Health Plans conducted by Mercer indicates that
					on average, our employees pay 25% less in premiums for family
					coverage annually than other employers in a similar peer group.
					This demonstrates OD’s commitment to making high quality healthcare
					affordable for our employees. The dental insurance provides for
					routine care, basic and major services, and children’s orthodontia.
					The vision insurance typically covers 100% of the charge for annual
					eye exams and provides a set dollar amount that can be used for
					eyeglasses or contacts. We partner with UnitedHealthcare to offer
					wellbeing benefits to our employees and their families such as
					QuitPower® Tobacco Cessation and the Healthy Pregnancy Program. We
					also offer flexible spending accounts that allow employees to set
					aside money pre-tax from their paychecks to pay for qualifying
					medical and dependent care expenses. Our employees see significant
					savings by using these accounts and they have the added security of
					planning for known medical expenses. We believe that the best type
					of health insurance is a healthy lifestyle and beginning in 2017,
					Old Dominion will be launching a company-wide wellness program
					emphasizing personal awareness and accountability for better
					health.
Your Financial Security
All employees are eligible to start contributing to the
					401(k) program after 30 days of employment. The program includes a
					generous company match and a wide range of investment options to
					help reach retirement goals. Basic term life insurance is provided
					to eligible employees at no cost to them and they may choose to
					purchase additional supplemental life insurance on themselves and
					their dependents. Old Dominion understands the importance of income
					protection and so we offer voluntary disability programs to provide
					income replacement should our employees face a serious illness or
					injury.
Your Pay
Our goal is to offer competitive base and variable pay
					programs for the exemplary employees we attract and hire. Our
					benefits package further complements our compensation program by
					offering a variety of valuable benefits for employees and their
					families.
Your/Work Life Balance
Eligible employees receive paid time off that includes
					vacation days (based on years of service), holidays and
					sick/personal time. We also offer an additional paid day off as a
					“birthday holiday” and who doesn’t love some extra attention on
					their birthday? Leave time is extended for approved periods of time
					away from work based on an employee’s own medical need, family
					members’ medical need, military service or other circumstances.
					Available to eligible employees and family members, the Employee
					Assistance Program provides confidential assessment, referral and
					counseling services.




We have established a great culture at OD that is hard to
					find or replicate. From our humble beginning in 1934 until today,
					there is still a close bond between everyone here. Whether it’s on
					the road, on the docks, in the office, or at one of our cook outs
					or many celebrations, there’s an attitude of sharing, caring and
					smiling. It’s an attitude our customers and team members value and
					appreciate too… one that makes us more than just a freight carrier.
					It makes us a family. A family that helps the world keep promises.

Our values of being ethical , innovative, reliable,
					courteous, responsive, and professional began with the Congdon
					family working side by side with each team member. We continue to
					follow this family tradition by having an easily accessible
					management team and celebrating successes with one another. We
					enjoy commemorating the birth of a child, applauding anniversary
					awards, retirements, driver champions, or simply celebrating one
					another. OD is a truly a great place to work.




Old Dominion is a true American success story. Earl and
					Lillian Congdon founded OD in 1934 with a single truck. These
					humble beginnings firmly rooted OD’s strong family culture from
					which would ultimately grow the nation’s 3rd largest LTL carrier.
					OD’s continued growth provides uncommon opportunity and security
					for thousands of employees, who are writing the next chapter of
					OD’s story.

Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. kept on trucking toward its first $3 billion revenue year in the second quarter while reporting Thursday record net income.The Thomasville less-than-truckload company, a top-10 U.S. carrier, had $94.4 million in net income, up 20.9 percent.Diluted earnings rose 21 cents to $1.19.The average forecast was $1.09 by nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Analysts typically do not include one-time gains and charges in their forecasts.On the revenue side, Old Dominion had an 11.2 percent jump to $839.9 million.For the first half of fiscal 2017, revenue is at $1.59 billion, up 8.9 percent over last year. It just missed $3 billion in fiscal 2016.The overall results are likely to encourage investors to send Old Dominion roaring past its 52-week share price high of $100.71 in early trading today.Old Dominion’s record performance centers on gaining market share through adding and expanding centers. As a less-than-truckload carrier, it ships products more quickly and attracts more customers because it does not depend on a full trailer to make a profit.“These were the best growth rates in revenue and earnings per share since our first quarter of 2015,” David Congdon, the company’s vice chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Congdon credited the revenue surge to increased demand and customers shipping heavier or larger orders.“We believe that the growth in (less-than-truckload) tonnage was attributable to the continued improvement in the domestic economy and the consistent execution of our long-term strategic plan of delivering superior service at a fair price,” Congdon said.For example, he said Old Dominion continues to maintain an on-time delivery rate of better than 99 percent.“With revenue growth continuing into the third quarter, we intend to hire additional employees so that we can continue to deliver superior service and position ourselves to win additional market share,” he said.However, Old Dominion’s strong annual performances of recent years have left it susceptible to investors’ and analysts’ higher earnings expectations.For example, Seeking Alpha contributor Stephen Simpson said before the earnings report that “Old Dominion shares have done well on the back of a good recovery in tonnage and prices.”“The growth of e-commerce and a greater focus on streamlined supply chains are creating new opportunities in less-than-truckload trucking that arguably play to Old Dominion's strengths in information technology and service.”Simpson cautioned Old Dominion “is back to what I would call its more typical valuation situation – relatively expensive compared to its likely medium/long-term earnings and cash flow prospects unless you are willing to give a relatively generous premium for its superior quality.”“One of the more persistent bear arguments on Old Dominion is that the company is about as well-run as it can be and it's going to be hard for the company to continue outperforming.
“In fact, some go as far as to argue that the service improvement efforts under way at Saia and other LTLs are whittling away Old Dominion's competitive advantages and that the company is due for a stretch of underperformance as a result.”Stifel analyst David Ross said Old Dominion's key to recent success "is that its network is better set up to benefit from additional volume due to the efficiency of its operation.""Incremental freight comes on at very low incremental cost, as opposed to other networks which might require more purchased transportation, dock labor, training costs, etc. to handle additional business.""It's knowing the cost of its network and using that knowledge as a tool to price freight and direct volume and density into the appropriate channels to maximize profitability," Ross said.Old Dominion had, at last count, 869 employees at its headquarters in Thomasville, 670 at a service center in Greensboro and 17,578 full-time employees overall, down 49 from a year ago.Old Dominion spent $16.5 million on cash dividends this fiscal year — the first in which it offered a dividend. It also spent $7.1 million on share repurchases, leaving $192.8 million on an authorized $250 million program.The company spent $131.3 million on capital investments during the quarter. It now projects spending $400 million during fiscal 2017: $185 million for real estate and service center expansions; $170 million for tractors and trailers (up $15 million); and $45 for information technology and other projects.Old Dominion said increased spending on tractors and trailers “is consistent with the company’s historical practice of reinvesting in its business to support long-term market share gains by ensuring it has the capacity to meet the service expectations of its customers.”

      “Old Dominion produced strong financial results for the second quarter 
      of 2017, which included a double-digit increase in revenue and an 
      increase of more than 20% in earnings per diluted share,” said David S. 
      Congdon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Old Dominion. 
      “These were the best growth rates in revenue and earnings per share 
      since our first quarter of 2015. The 11.2% increase in revenue for the 
      second quarter was driven by a 6.1% increase in LTL tonnage per day and 
      a 5.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel 
      surcharges, our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 3.8%. We believe 
      that the growth in LTL tonnage was attributable to the continued 
      improvement in the domestic economy and the consistent execution of our 
      long-term strategic plan of delivering superior service at a fair price.
    

      “The Company’s operating ratio in the second quarter of 2017 improved 
      140 basis points to a new Company record of 80.9%. This improvement was 
      generally due to the leverage created by our accelerated revenue growth, 
      which benefited from increases in both freight density and yield. As a 
      result, most of our operating costs improved as a percent of revenue 
      when compared to the second quarter of 2016.
    

      “We continued to deliver best-in-class service to our customers in the 
      second quarter of 2017, with on-time deliveries in excess of 99% and a 
      cargo claims ratio that improved to a new Company record of less than 
      0.2%. With revenue growth continuing into the third quarter, we intend 
      to hire additional employees so that we can continue to deliver superior 
      service and position ourselves to win additional market share.”
    

Cash Flow and Use of Capital


      Old Dominion’s net cash provided by operating activities was $127.7 
      million for the second quarter of 2017 and $238.5 million for the first 
      half of the year. The Company had $33.8 million in cash and cash 
      equivalents at the end of the second quarter and a ratio of 
      debt-to-total capitalization of 4.5% compared with 11.1% at June 30, 
      2016.
    

      Capital expenditures were $131.3 million for the second quarter of 2017 
      and $188.3 million for the first half of the year. The Company expects 
      its capital expenditures for 2017 to total approximately $400 million, 
      including planned expenditures of $185 million for real estate and 
      service center expansion projects, $170 million for tractors and 
      trailers, and $45 million for technology and other assets. The Company 
      recently increased its estimated annual expenditures for tractors and 
      trailers by $15 million due to its growth expectations. This increase is 
      consistent with the Company’s historical practice of reinvesting in its 
      business to support long-term market share gains by ensuring it has the 
      capacity to meet the service expectations of its customers.
    

      Old Dominion returned $15.3 million of capital to its shareholders in 
      the second quarter of 2017 and $23.6 million for the first half of the 
      year. This year-to-date total includes $16.5 million in cash dividends 
      and $7.1 million of share repurchases, leaving $192.8 million available 
      for share repurchases under the Company’s current $250.0 million stock 
      repurchase program.
    

Summary


      Mr. Congdon concluded, “Old Dominion’s robust second-quarter operating 
      and financial performance highlighted many of the core strengths of our 
      business model. We are encouraged by these results as well as our 
      revenue growth trends and the momentum of the domestic economy. As a 
      result, we will continue to make the investments necessary to support 
      the future growth of our business. We thank our employees for their 
      continued execution of our business model, which we believe supports 
      long-term growth in shareholder value.”

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
