How to Evaluate Investors for a Seed VC Syndicate



David Beisel 
                                • June 25, 2014 • 12 min read


When raising a round of seed venture capital, founders often focus the bulk of their time and energy on securing meetings and nailing their pitches — and rightfully so. It’s absolutely critical to secure that first interested party in order to more easily convince other investors to join and complete your round of funding. But what about that latter part? What happens when you actually do succeed in generating interest, and now the task is to round out the fundraise with multiple firms on board? The process wherein a VC syndicate crystallizes to close a seed-stage investment can be complex and unclear from the outside, yet it represents a vital step in the process for founders.
Below, I aim to shed light on the decision-making process to help entrepreneurs better evaluate firms for a seed VC syndicate.
Before we begin, it’s important to acknowledge that there are actually two common and distinct strategies for raising a seed round of capital:
1. Subscription approach – An entrepreneur sets a structure (usually a convertible note) and recruits individual angel investors who subscribe to the round, all without a term-driving lead investor.
2. Term-driving investor approach – An entrepreneur finds a lead institutional investor (or quasi-institutional) to price and set the structure and dynamics of the round, working together to bring in additional syndicate partners. These syndicate partners might be other seed-stage funds, individual angels, or both.
(As a quick aside, the subscription approach might also include venture capital firms, but this is typically for very “hot” companies or in a competitive environment, like at a Y Combinator Demo Day. )
Deciding between the above two options is a post for another day, but when entrepreneurs select the latter route, and multiple VCs invest together, founders are then faced with the daunting task of navigating the murky waters of all the various firms who are active seed-stage investors — and many more who at least market themselves as such despite their sweet spot lying somewhere in later rounds. And while we’ve seen an increasing amount of information and transparency about the players in this market, it can be challenging to embark on a set of initial meetings with investors without an understanding of how these VC syndicates are formed.
Factors to Consider for a VC Syndicate
Every firm, whether it follows a dedicated seed venture strategy, a full life-cycle approach, or somewhere in between, has a set of qualities that affect how they would fit into a seed venture round syndicate.
(Editor’s note: We hope you find this post useful regardless of whether you interact with NextView Ventures. However, since we often receive questions about our approach to each of these factors, NextView-specific information has been added after each.)
Check Size
Some firms have a typical seed check size which is their standard bite size (as low as five-figures as high as seven). Others are check size agnostic and therefore very flexible because it’s just about the option on the following round. Still others have different decision-making processes for different check sizes within a seed round. Unfortunately, this figure is rarely if ever on a firm’s website and must be asked during the first meeting.
[At NextView: Check size varies but generally falls between $250K and $1M per investment.]
Willingness to Lead
This leadership dynamic is important especially when talking with seed-only funds, as many firms have an explicit strategy of only participating in a round coming together with a third-party lead syndicate VC partner. I’ve seen many entrepreneurs find themselves with numerous parties “interested to follow” but without a firm willing to catalyze the process. There is some correlation here, though not complete alignment, to check size (i.e. larger check writers have a greater tendency to lead rounds).
[At NextView: We have a bias, but not a requirement, towards leading a round, and we always syndicate with other institutional and individual investors. Since we are a seed-focused firm, the only time NextView leads is during a seed round, though we reserve follow-on capital for our existing portfolio company’s future rounds of financing.]
Level of Lead Investor’s Involvement Post-Financing
Venture firms approach involvement after a seed round wildly differently. For larger, full life-cycle firms which also make a number of early-stage investments, partner involvement can be little to none at the seed stage. Yet for some of these firms, the partner may be more hands on if the startup “counts” as a full investment within their partnership dynamics. It all depends on a specific firm’s approach. Similarly, even for dedicated seed-stage VCs, partner involvement can vary depending on a firm’s strategy. In both cases, the amount of time spent is generally inversely proportional to the number of new seed investments the firm does a whole each year.
[At NextVew: Each partner makes just a handful of investments per year where there’s high conviction and alignment with founders, as we believe in being hands-on and offering support during the first few formative years of a company’s growth.]
Board Seat Requirements
Partner involvement after seed financing can, but doesn’t always, require codification with a board seat. The board seat dance at the seed stage can be a challenge on either direction: Occasionally. no firms want to designate someone’s time for the role, while other times, more than one investor may be looking for an official board role despite not being a fit at this stage. This dynamic typically unfolds based on how involved a partner plans to be with a given company (i.e. more time spent translates into more desire for board seat), but some firms are satisfied with “in-between” measures like official board observer status and defined information rights.
[At NextView: We typically like to take a board seat or board observer role during the first 18-24 months, when we feel we can have the greatest impact and provide the most guidance.]
Additional Systematic Value-Add After Investment
Some VCs can add an additional set of benefits. For instance, corporate strategic investors often offer unique support for operating businesses, while firms with large portfolios may have network effects among its companies, partners, and staff. Additionally, some larger VCs might offer a range of “full-service” support options, including PR, recruiting, and other functions.
There are many ways that venture firms can help their portfolio CEOs during the seed-stage in lieu of — or in addition to — partner involvement, all of which can be a real plus but may not be immediately obvious to founders during the fundraise process.
[At NextView: We aim to add additional value through a suite of educational and business development initiatives for both the portfolio and greater startup community, run by our director of platform.]
Geography
It’s always easiest for a VC to make an investment in his or her own backyard, especially at the seed stage where partner involvement is so critical. Geography thus becomes a more acute issue. So as a general rule, seed-stage firms have a greater tendency than larger firms to follow a strategy which focuses on a particular city or region. Of all the attributes in this list, geographic preference is perhaps the easiest for founders to discern just from looking at a portfolio company list on a VC’s site. But actions speak louder than words – sometimes VC firms would like to market geographic focus or agnosticism, but in practice it deviates. No matter what a VC says, the proverbial bar is higher in making an investment outside their typical geography, however that’s defined.
[At NextView: We invest solely in US-headquartered companies, with about 80% of that activity happening between Boston and New York.]
Sector Focus (or Lack Thereof)
Like geography, sector focus can be more readily gleaned from a portfolio company list than from a firm’s marketing, as the two sometimes differ. After all, where a firm has been and where it wants to go can be two different things. Some funds promote themselves as completely focusing on a particular space, while others take a broader approach. It’s important for the partner and firm to have some background in the area of a new investment, but extremely heavy investor concentration in a particular space can have risks in addition to rewards for an entrepreneur.
[At NextView: Our focus tends to come from other factors such as stage of growth and geography and, as a result, we invest across a number of sectors, from B2B SaaS to consumer apps to platform companies to deeper technical plays like ad tech infrastructure and much more. This is best seen on our site under “Investments.”]
Follow-on Capital
Many people have covered this topic in the blogosphere about the perils of venture firms’ signaling in follow-on financing subsequent to seed rounds. (For those unfamiliar, the quick summary: If a later-stage VC invests in your seed round but declines future rounds, that signals to other investors that something might be amiss, making later rounds harder to raise.) It’s not worth rehashing the dialogue in full here, other than to say that signaling issue of larger life-cycle VCs is real. Period. We’ve seen it directly in our portfolio companies raising successive rounds.
That being said, there are indeed clear benefits to having deep pockets at the table immediately from the seed round. I think that the most important aspect of this issue is for a venture firm to state a clear follow-on approach and be consistent in implementing it. The most trouble comes when a player’s intentions are unknown (or undefined) or inconsistently applied so that there are surprises in the subsequent follow-on process.
[At NextView: Since we don’t lead later rounds and won’t invest for the first time unless it’s seed-stage, potential signaling issues are nonexistent. And again, we do reserve follow-on capital for our existing portfolio company’s future rounds of financing led by other investors.]
Conflicts of Interest in Existing Portfolio
Especially given that some seed-only funds follow a rapid deployment strategy in making dozens of investments annually, competitive conflicts of new investments and even existing investments with others in a portfolio can be a real factor. Some firms are lax about these conflicts (which indeed are sometimes inevitable when startups pivot), while others are very strict about not having more than one company in a general space. But I have observed VC firms intentionally invest in competitive offerings.
[At NextView: We won’t make a new investment in a startup which, at the time of that investment, would be competitive with one of our existing portfolio companies.]
Prestige of a Firm or Investor
Nobody explicitly talks about it because it’s implied: prestige matters. It matters in a lot of things, from recruiting all the way to attracting that next round of financing. On the margin, higher-prestige seed investors attract higher quality Series A investors.
[At NextView: We strive to earn the respect of entrepreneurs and co-investors with whom we work every day to build great companies.]
Institutional LPs and Standard VC Fund Structure
Why a VC’s fund structure matters to an entrepreneur isn’t immediately obvious: It’s about consistency of behavior. For example, the more traditional, “plain vanilla” the structure, the more the investors are going to be motivated based on financial gains on a consistent basis. That’s not to say that these traditional VCs are going to behave badly, just that any and all behavior and expectations from your investors should be consistent so at least you know the driving force motivating their actions.
Less formalized sources or non-traditional structures of capital, on the other hand, can sometimes exhibit more erratic, non-financially motivated behavior. Thus, when a syndicate forms, understanding structural bounds and consistency in investor actions is key for each member of the partnership to avoid surprises down the road.
[At NextView: This is best explained by visiting our site and clicking “Approach” to view our investment model and more info on our partnership dynamics.]
Personal Dynamics
Last but certainly not least is the answer to an extremely important question: Do you as the entrepreneur want to work with both the person and partnership on the other side of the table? Are you merely holding your nose because the money is green or do you truly want to work alongside this person for the months and years to come?
[At NextView: We’re solely focused on seed and go to painstaking lengths to invest in a small number of companies in order to be hands-on partners. We therefore believe this is one of or even the most important factor to consider when a founder evaluates other firms to syndicate a round.]
Building an Optimal Seed VC Syndicate
Putting together a seed VC syndicate of one or more firms is like fitting together many puzzle pieces. There are different “right” attributes for a startup’s round depending on the situation, and even then, those characteristics can be assembled by selecting one firm which most closely matches or by aggregating a series of participants which bring a couple of those attributes to the table.
The key in building the optimal seed VC syndicate is to figure out what qualities should be present and then construct a scenario which includes them with one or more partners. Without doing easy homework and asking the right questions up front, entrepreneurs can miss out on including valuable investors in the round -or- add too many non-valuable or “redundant” constituents which just complicate the composition and communication going forward.
At times, larger life-cycle VCs aren’t as consistent in their approach to the above list because the exact parameters of a seed investment aren’t clearly defined internally. It’s not their main focus or even a major priority in some cases. Dedicated seed firms, on the other hand, often have a fairly set and consistent answer to most of these questions, as participating in seed rounds is their bread and butter. Yet even then, it’s not ever black and white or wholly consistent. My hope is that this list helps you navigate this increasingly complex process.

David, Great article and very applicable to my situation. If strategy #2 is used by the founders and they work more closely with a lead investor to rope in others, are there cases where some of the subsequent investors are interested in being the lead, rather than the initial investor, and in this case, what is the protocol? Do most founders and lead investors have an ironclad agreement before approaching the other investors?

Free Templates for Great Startup Pitch Decks, Direct from VCs



David Beisel 
                                • February 3, 2015 • 7 min read


Today, NextView Ventures is excited to release a pillar project in our Growth Guides series: pitch deck templates for raising seed capital. These help address a common question which we frequently receive from entrepreneurs about how to create startup pitch decks for this crucial financial milestone.
For context, last year, based on questions from our existing portfolio, we launched two board deck templates for seed-stage startups. These were well-received, so we next turned our attention to entrepreneurs outside the portfolio to ask what questions we could address in a similar fashion. The response was consistent and clear: “Thanks for those board decks — hope to use them someday — but I’m still raising a seed round right now. What makes a great pitch deck?”
This answer was somewhat surprising — there seem to be several templates like this which already exist. But the feedback we received was that those decks (a) are somewhat generic and not built specifically for seed-stage startups, which often require more art than science during the pitch, and (b) lack storytelling components and design and layout sensibility.
So, we hope these two deck resources can address both issues. We also aimed to take these one step further by adding our own VC commentary throughout the slides and by providing two different, somewhat unique versions of great pitch decks.
Read on for more context, or download your templates right here:

Two Unique Pitch Deck Styles
Jay Acunzo, our VP of Platform who largely created these slides, asked us a poignant question before we began this project: Aside from the accepted format of pitch decks today, what did we as VCs wish they could be? If we’re designing a great early-stage startup pitch from the ground up, what would that look like?
From our perspective at NextView, startup pitch meetings should come in two flavors:
The first is a conversation.
Usually, when raising a seed round, your pitch process with a VC firm starts with a small number of meetings with just one or two team members — or else you’re pitching angel investors individually. In those contexts, it’s a lot less likely that you’ll want to stand up and “pitch” a deck. Usually, a more human interaction works better. You introduce yourself, you talk about why you started your company, and you start digging into the details in a conversational way.
This is the way my partners and I tend to operate in our initial meetings, too, whether we’re being pitched or raising money ourselves. In the end, I think discussion-based meetings are simply the way people want to interact with others they’re speaking with for the first time. It just feels more human and natural, in addition to helping both sides learn a great deal about the other.
The second type of pitch is more of a show.
Maybe you are presenting in front of a crowd in a demo-day scenario, or perhaps it’s to a larger group like the full partnership of a big firm. In these cases, the interaction is very, very different. It tends to be more one-way — more of a presentation than a discussion.
In these pitches, you have to carefully choose the details into which you dive more deeply, since you don’t want anything to go over people’s heads, nor do you want to confuse an audience that lacks the ability to have a back-and-forth discussion to find clarity.
Instead, what you actually want to do is drive home the story and the excitement of the opportunity, as well as the inevitability of your success. Emotion is a bit more crucial here, since this may be the first or only major interaction you have with these people during your fundraise.
But here’s the problem we often encounter with the standard pitch deck:
Most fundraising decks are a poor compromise between the needs of both of these meetings — conversation and show — and so they leave much to be desired as an investor, generally speaking.
To address this and slightly rethink what pitches should be, we created two different suggested templates for fundraising decks: a short explainer with a “kitchen sink” FAQ section and another style we’ve dubbed “The Show.”
Some quick context on each:
Pitch Deck Template #1: Explainer + Kitchen Sink Appendix

The first template you’ll encounter is designed for a discussion-based pitch. It’s super short – just a handful of slides to convey the basic, critical details up front. However, it includes a “kitchen sink” of FAQs in the appendix.
The shortness of the up front pitch can be incredibly helpful one-on-one. When you’re speaking to an investor, you can say, “I have a few slides that might help introduce the company, but we can keep it pretty conversational and dive into specific questions once you get the gist.”
It fits the format, but it also allows you to demonstrate mastery over the details of your business by pulling up a slide from the appendix if/when the discussion requires it. Does the VC have a detailed question about the product roadmap? No problem, just turn to page 16 in the appendix. Did the discussion evolve into an exploration of your go-to-market strategy? Perfect — easily pull up page 6 in the appendix as a backdrop to the conversation.
Also, you don’t need to sweat the order of the details in the appendix to weave the pieces together like a high-school essay. The first few slides are neatly and logically ordered, while the appendix serves as backup.
As my partner Rob Go points out, this approach puts you on more equal footing with an investor: “It’s less of a ‘pitch to me’ kind of interaction and more of a discussion, which is really good in building early trust and rapport.”
The appendix becomes a flexible go-to resource to augment a genuine dialog with the investor. This Explainer+Kitchen Sink approach allows for a natural discussion to unfold, while still clearly demonstrating that you’ve come fully prepared and have a strong handle on your business. In a one-on-one setting, this format is going to have much more of an impact than the more rote “flipbook” of slide after slide.
Pitch Deck Template #2: The Show

This second deck is great for the second type of meeting where there’s a larger audience. This is when emotion-driven stories delivered start to finish make more sense. The Show is longer and very focused on telling a cohesive narrative that elicits a (hopefully) positive emotional response.
By including The Show in our templates, we’re also acknowledging that certain settings aren’t well suited to digging into all of the details of the business and that different members of the audience likely start from different places in their understanding of what’s going in on your company and your market.
That said, The Show isn’t just fluff. It should demonstrate good prioritization of the details that matter from the entrepreneur. You need to have just as much mastery over your business as in the case of the other pitch deck in the event that an investor wants to dig in a bit further.
Like all templates, these are just guides, and you probably don’t want to include absolutely everything in your own deck. As you flip through the slides which we’ve created, look for the call-outs from my partners and I to inform your own versions.
Pitching NextView? Some Context
Although we hope this helps entrepreneurs generally, we recognize that some of the audience reading might eventually meet with someone at NextView. To that end, I wanted to share at least a little context, which is simply this: Stay true to your own style and comfort level. Don’t feel the need to directly utilize either or both of these templates — they’re merely suggested guides for those at the beginning of the deck creation process, not prescriptions on how things have to be done. Every startup is unique, and so are the best ways to present them.
Without further ado, I encourage you to download these templates and share with anyone that might benefit. Best of luck telling your startup’s story and delivering a successful pitch.

Jay Acunzo



Hi Phil – I played around just now and couldn’t find a broken link, but here’s the URL directly just in case: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rjd9m1xljrggsnp/Pitch%20Deck%20Templates%20for%20Seed%20Capital%20-%20NextView%20Ventures.pptx?dl=0
Let me know which one caused the issue, and I’ll work to fix it. Thanks!






Phil Spitzer



thanks!










Omeid



Very helpful post! What should entrepreneurs do when a potential investor asks the entrepreneur to email a pitch deck? Do you recommend sending version 1 without the FAQ slides?






Jay Acunzo



Thanks Omeid! And that’s definitely the approach we’d recommend for sharing info via email. NextView partner Rob Go wrote a bit more about this in this post, under the Email section: http://nextviewventures.com/blog/startup-pitch-deck-founder-vc-interactions/






Omeid



Thanks for the link!






Omeid



Hi Jay, 
Do the dates go in the “Launch, Traction, Growth” graphic? Seems like the three columns would need the same dates….For example, we worked on these priority tasks for a three month period, here are the raw numbers (in the traction column), and the growth rates in the growth column. 
What numbers would go in the traction/growth columns for “drive initial signups”? I’m confused because there is a “target results” row that says “x initial users”. 
Sorry if I’m asking the wrong questions or have completely misinterpreted this slide. I’d like to figure out what’s going on. 
Best,
Omeid






Jay Acunzo



If I’m understanding your questions correctly, you’re looking at the exact inputs of certain slides. You should treat those as merely placeholders and rework all of them based on your specific business. For example, you might not say “drive user signups.”
In general, the slides are meant to be directional to show you what basic info should be included. I’d ignore the blue copy in favor of telling your specific story. Good luck!






Omeid



Thanks. I was more so trying to figure out the structure of this slide. I knew the examples are merely examples, but didn’t know how the use of dates applied to those examples.

        We Lead Seed Rounds in Bold Founders Who Use Code to Create Transformational Companies
      

         In the future, the way we interact with technology will be drastically different, all the screens people currently interact with will disappear and be replaced by more humanistic and natural interfaces. Instead of tapping on a phone, you might message with friends using gestures and voice and receive replies in augmented reality. We think of this as a new era of seamless computing and it is why we are especially interested in funding: Conversational UIs, Robotics, VR/AR, and Software Disrupting Mature Industries. We see artificial intelligence as a layer that will power all these sectors.

  
Because the partners all have a strong technical background, we look for founders who not only have the vision, but also the chops to build the best products, and the grit required to power through the ups and downs. We generally look for companies we believe can take a monopolistic position in their market. We also have to believe the founder is uniquely positioned to exploit a highly attractive market in terms of competition, size, growth rate and timing.  
      

        The Eniac Platform
      

       From the beginning one of the keys to Eniac’s success has been taking a holistic approach to supporting our portfolio. With Eniac you get four partners for the price of one, and each partner uses their unique experience to open doors and advise our investments. The result has led to companies that consistently bring quality product to market, find follow on investment and have a measurable impact across industries.
With each fund our approach has evolved and expanded to address the growing needs of our portfolio companies. We want our founders to focus on their product, so we created the Eniac Platform. Term sheets are just the first step, working with Eniac companies enjoy the following support: 
Talent recruiter to find the best employees, especially in engineering
Public relations and marketing specialist on staff to help your product reach the audiences that matter from launch through growth
Operations resources to organize your staff and install best practices
Business development and networking opportunities with thousands of the top companies, investors, and brands
Connections to other founders in Eniac’s portfolio to explore synergies and opportunities  
Fundraising support including pitch deck guidance, follow on investor strategy, and syndicate building







Team



      WHO WE ARE
    

 Although Eniac Ventures began investing in 2010, the roots trace back to four like-minded University of Pennsylvania students over two decades ago. After college our partners set out on separate but parallel paths as serial entrepreneurs but maintained a strong bond and network of support. Today our combined 80 years of experience building over a dozen companies, and our belief in a strong community are at the heart and soul of our investment approach.

Hadley Harris
FOUNDING GENERAL PARTNER


        Hadley has done a little bit of everything on the path to co-founding Eniac. Starting as an engineer at Pegasystems, he later took on roles as a product manager at Microsoft and strategist at Samsung, where it became clear that big companies were not for him.

In 2007 he was very fortunate to join a very talented AI team out of MIT at Vlingo where he ran a few aspects of the business across product and marketing until it was sold to Nuance for $225M. He rolled his experience building a successful startup into Thumb where as CMO he helped the real-time recommendation app reach user engagement levels second only to Facebook before being acquired. 

Hadley grew up in downtown Boston, which shaped his lifelong love of science, hip hop and the New England Patriots.  Outside the office Hadley enjoys jogging, meditating, mixing music and traveling the world. 
Hadley is passionate about improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, which stems from his close relationship with his brother Traves.  He is a development board member for Cardinal Cushing Centers where Traves was a student and current member of its adult program.
  
Hadley is still paying off student loans for his MBA from Wharton and bachelors in Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania.

Nihal Mehta
FOUNDING GENERAL PARTNER

        At Eniac we call Nihal the human rolodex, thanks to the thousands of connections he has made with some of world’s top companies and brands. He developed many of these connections over the past 20 years while founding five different high tech startups. Most recently Nihal was the founding CEO of LocalResponse, where he grew revenues 2153% in three years and landed them at number 204 in the 2014 INC. 5000’s Fastest Growing Companies. Prior to LocalResponse, Nihal founded buzzd, the first real-time mobile cityguide, and ipsh!, one of the first full-service mobile marketing agencies in 2001, which was acquired by Omnicom (NYSE: OMC) in 2005.
  
Even before founding Eniac, Nihal honed his ability to spot top entrepreneurial talent by investing in Admob (acquired by Google), Swiftkey (acquired by Microsoft), Tala, Tapad (acquired by Telenor), and Uber to name a few. Because of his experience both building and funding top technologies, he frequently guest lectures at business schools around the country on entrepreneurship and mobile marketing, and is published in over 15 books and white papers on the subject. 
  
Outside of the office Nihal loves to spend time with his wife Reshma and is a big supporter of her non-profit Girls Who Code. Around town you will usually see him with his son Shaan and beagle-bulldog Stanley. Nihal is the life of the party, which is why he always spearheads Eniac events. 
  
Nihal graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in Philosophy and a BSE in Computer Science.

Vic Singh
FOUNDING GENERAL PARTNER

Vic Singh is a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of Eniac Ventures. He cut his teeth building products for the consumer internet with an emphasis on communication and developer tools. Most recently Vic was founder and CEO of Kanvas, a mobile platform for creativity which he led to a successful exit by Aol. Vic previously founded Tracks, a venture backed mobile platform for collaboration around experiences and NearVerse, a platform for location based peer to peer media sharing. Before he was a founder, Vic was a venture capitalist at RRE Ventures where he focused on consumer and cleantech technology. He started his career building large scale enterprise systems as a developer. 
  
Outside of the board room, Vic loves to spend time with his wife and two year old daughter Layla, who he is teaching to cook. He was born in the Caribbean in Guyana and loves to bring West Indian spice into his cuisine. Vic is a 90s hip hop head and even though he grew up in Queens, he can’t get enough 2Pac. 
  
Vic holds an MBA from Columbia Business School where he was a Robert Toigo Foundation Fellow and a BSE from the University of Pennsylvania where we earned the National Science Foundation Fellow for his work in Micro-electro Mechanical Systems.  
      



 @vicsingh  





Tim Young
FOUNDING GENERAL PARTNER

        The partners call Tim the closer because of his ability to find the best partners and close rounds for our portfolio companies. Prior to co-founding Eniac, Tim honed this skill over 20 years investing and building his own companies. In 2001, Tim founded Bridge, an enterprise software company focused on corporate training in Beijing, China, which he led to an 8-figure exit. Prior to Bridge, Tim led product at Quoteship which exited to Logistics.com  (NASDAQ: ICGE).  He also worked for ExxonMobil as a developer and Mofo where he advised startups on IP and financing.
  
During his downtime, you can find Tim exploring the mountains or oceans. He has found a way to combine his passions for travel and waves, having surfed on five continents and plans to sail to Hawaii in the upcoming Pacific Cup.
  
Tim started as an engineer and earned his BSE in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, where he received the Bristol-Myers Squibb award for his work in cancer research. Tim also returned to earn a J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

Anna Ring
HEAD OF PLATFORM
  
Anna has worked in business operations for over a decade, using her broad background in finance, human resources, and administration management to help companies grow. She has overseen growth from just a handful of employees to over 100, all while keeping chaos at bay with proactive strategies.
  
In addition to keeping things running smoothly at Eniac Ventures, Anna provides vital support to our portfolio companies by establishing processes, operational systems, and implementing best practices. 
  
When Anna is not improving systems and processes, you can find her hiking in the Bay Area or deadlifting at the gym. In the evenings Anna turns to her passion for gastronomy and is either exploring new restaurants or throwing dinner parties. 
  
Anna moved from Europe to California in 2004 for college and she graduated from University of California Santa Cruz with a BA in Business Management Economics. Back then she promised her family she would only be gone for 4 years, but it’s now been over 12 years thanks to the charm of the San Francisco Bay Area.
