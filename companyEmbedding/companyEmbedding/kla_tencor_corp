History[edit]
KLA-Tencor was formed in 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments, two companies in the semiconductor equipment and yield management systems industry. KLA Instruments was founded in 1975 by Ken Levy and Bob Anderson, and focused on defect inspection solutions. Karel Urbanek established Tencor Instruments in 1977 with an emphasis on metrology solutions.
Since the merger, which was valued at $1.3 billion, KLA-Tencor has acquired 19 additional companies:

1998: Amray Inc.; Nanopro GmbH; The Quantox product line from Keithley Instruments, Inc.; VARS; The Ultrapointe subsidiary of Uniphase Corporation
1999: ACME Systems Inc.
2000: Fab Solutions, from ObjectSpace Inc.; FINLE Technologies, Inc.
2001: Phase Metrics
2004: Candela Instruments; Wafer Inspection Systems business of Inspex, Inc.
2006: ADE Corporation
2007: OnWafer Technologies; SensArray Corporation; Therma-Wave Corporation
2008: ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV; Microelectronic Inspection Equipment (MIE) business unit of Vistec Semiconductor Systems
2010: Ambios Technology
2014: Luminescent Technologies
2017: Zeta Technologies

In October 2015, Lam Research Corporation announced plans to buy KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move.[5] In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice[6] over antitrust concerns.
Process control technology and applications[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s defect inspection and metrology products and related offerings can be broadly categorized into the following groups: Chip Manufacturing, Reticle Manufacturing, Data Storage Media/Head Manufacturing, LED Manufacturing, Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing, Microelectromechanical Systems (“MEMS”) Manufacturing, and Surface Profilometry and Metrology. KLA-Tencor also provides refurbished tools as part of its K-T Certified™ program [3]
Research and Development[edit]
The market for yield management and process control systems is characterized by rapid technology development and product innovation. KLA-Tencor employs a large staff of full-time engineers and scientists and invests heavily in product research and development.
Facilities[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s global operations include manufacturing, support and R&D facilities throughout Europe, the United States, Japan and Asia/Pacific.

KLA-Tencor Corporation is a global capital equipment company based in Milpitas, California. It supplies process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry and other related nanoelectronics industries. The company's products and services are intended for all phases of wafer, reticle, integrated circuit (IC) and packaging production, from research and development to final volume manufacturing.[3]
KLA-Tencor’s products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, reticle and disk manufacturers around the world. These customers rely on KLA-Tencor’s inline unpatterned and patterned wafer defect monitoring, review and classification; reticle defect inspection and metrology; packaging and interconnect inspection; critical dimension (CD) metrology; pattern overlay metrology; film thickness, surface topography and composition measurements; measurement of in-chamber process conditions; wafer shape and stress metrology; computational lithography tools; and, overall yield and fab-wide data management and analysis systems.
KT Services[3] is the company’s global service network that maintains the productivity and performance of the extensive installed base of KLA-Tencor tools.
In 2000 the company formally established the KLA-Tencor Foundation, its philanthropic arm.[4] KLA-Tencor Foundation supports and benefits the global communities in which KLA-Tencor employees live and work.

History[edit]
KLA-Tencor was formed in 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments, two companies in the semiconductor equipment and yield management systems industry. KLA Instruments was founded in 1975 by Ken Levy and Bob Anderson, and focused on defect inspection solutions. Karel Urbanek established Tencor Instruments in 1977 with an emphasis on metrology solutions.
Since the merger, which was valued at $1.3 billion, KLA-Tencor has acquired 19 additional companies:

1998: Amray Inc.; Nanopro GmbH; The Quantox product line from Keithley Instruments, Inc.; VARS; The Ultrapointe subsidiary of Uniphase Corporation
1999: ACME Systems Inc.
2000: Fab Solutions, from ObjectSpace Inc.; FINLE Technologies, Inc.
2001: Phase Metrics
2004: Candela Instruments; Wafer Inspection Systems business of Inspex, Inc.
2006: ADE Corporation
2007: OnWafer Technologies; SensArray Corporation; Therma-Wave Corporation
2008: ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV; Microelectronic Inspection Equipment (MIE) business unit of Vistec Semiconductor Systems
2010: Ambios Technology
2014: Luminescent Technologies
2017: Zeta Technologies

In October 2015, Lam Research Corporation announced plans to buy KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move.[5] In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice[6] over antitrust concerns.
Process control technology and applications[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s defect inspection and metrology products and related offerings can be broadly categorized into the following groups: Chip Manufacturing, Reticle Manufacturing, Data Storage Media/Head Manufacturing, LED Manufacturing, Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing, Microelectromechanical Systems (“MEMS”) Manufacturing, and Surface Profilometry and Metrology. KLA-Tencor also provides refurbished tools as part of its K-T Certified™ program [3]
Research and Development[edit]
The market for yield management and process control systems is characterized by rapid technology development and product innovation. KLA-Tencor employs a large staff of full-time engineers and scientists and invests heavily in product research and development.
Facilities[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s global operations include manufacturing, support and R&D facilities throughout Europe, the United States, Japan and Asia/Pacific.
Management[edit]

History[edit]
KLA-Tencor was formed in 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments, two companies in the semiconductor equipment and yield management systems industry. KLA Instruments was founded in 1975 by Ken Levy and Bob Anderson, and focused on defect inspection solutions. Karel Urbanek established Tencor Instruments in 1977 with an emphasis on metrology solutions.
Since the merger, which was valued at $1.3 billion, KLA-Tencor has acquired 19 additional companies:

1998: Amray Inc.; Nanopro GmbH; The Quantox product line from Keithley Instruments, Inc.; VARS; The Ultrapointe subsidiary of Uniphase Corporation
1999: ACME Systems Inc.
2000: Fab Solutions, from ObjectSpace Inc.; FINLE Technologies, Inc.
2001: Phase Metrics
2004: Candela Instruments; Wafer Inspection Systems business of Inspex, Inc.
2006: ADE Corporation
2007: OnWafer Technologies; SensArray Corporation; Therma-Wave Corporation
2008: ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV; Microelectronic Inspection Equipment (MIE) business unit of Vistec Semiconductor Systems
2010: Ambios Technology
2014: Luminescent Technologies
2017: Zeta Technologies

In October 2015, Lam Research Corporation announced plans to buy KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move.[5] In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice[6] over antitrust concerns.
Process control technology and applications[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s defect inspection and metrology products and related offerings can be broadly categorized into the following groups: Chip Manufacturing, Reticle Manufacturing, Data Storage Media/Head Manufacturing, LED Manufacturing, Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing, Microelectromechanical Systems (“MEMS”) Manufacturing, and Surface Profilometry and Metrology. KLA-Tencor also provides refurbished tools as part of its K-T Certified™ program [3]
Research and Development[edit]
The market for yield management and process control systems is characterized by rapid technology development and product innovation. KLA-Tencor employs a large staff of full-time engineers and scientists and invests heavily in product research and development.
Facilities[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s global operations include manufacturing, support and R&D facilities throughout Europe, the United States, Japan and Asia/Pacific.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
