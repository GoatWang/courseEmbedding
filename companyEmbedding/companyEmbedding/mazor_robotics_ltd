      Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed 
      against Mazor Robotics Ltd. (“Mazor” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:MZOR) and 
      certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States 
      District Court, Southern District of New York, and docketed under 
      17-cv-04422, is on behalf of a class consisting of investors who 
      purchased or otherwise acquired Mazor’s American Depositary Receipts 
      (“ADRs”) securities, seeking to recover compensable damages caused by 
      defendants’ violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    

      If you are a shareholder who purchased Mazor securities between November 
      8, 2016 and June 7, 2017, both dates inclusive, you have until August 8, 
      2017 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A 
      copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. 
      To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com 
      or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, ext. 9980. Those who 
      inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, 
      telephone number, and number of shares purchased.

      Mazor is a medical device company that purportedly develops and markets 
      innovative surgical guidance systems and complementary products. The 
      Company claims that its expertise is computerized and imaging-based 
      systems, primarily in the field of spine surgery, and that its Surgical 
      Guidance Systems enable surgeons to advance from freehand surgical 
      procedures to accurate, pre-planned, state-of-the-art, precision guided 
      procedures.
    

      The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made 
      materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s 
      business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants 
      made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: 
      (i) that the Company was engaged in conduct that subjected it to ISA 
      investigation; (ii) that, as such the Company was exposed to potential 
      liability; and (iii) as a result of the foregoing, Mazor’s public 
      statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.
    

      On June 8, 2017, Mazor disclosed to investors that the Israel Securities 
      Authority (“ISA”) had conducted a search at the Company’s offices in May 
      2017 and questioned certain of Mazor’s officers in connection with an 
      ISA investigation.
    

      On this news, Mazor’s ADR price fell $3.70, or 9.9%, to close at $33.67 
      on June 8, 2017. The next day, the ADR price continued to decline, 
      falling another $3.08, or 9.1%, to close at $30.59 on June 9, 2017.
    

      The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and Los 
      Angeles, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of 
      corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the 
      late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, 
      the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. 
      Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the 
      tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of 
      securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. 
      The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on 
      behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com

 Rosen Law Firm Reminds Mazor Robotics Ltd. Investors of Important Deadline in Class Action - MZOR




                    Monday, July 17, 2017 1:04 PM  UTC

NEW YORK, July  17, 2017   -- Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Mazor Corporation (NASDAQ:MZOR) from November 8, 2016 through June 8, 2017, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”) of the important August 8, 2017 lead plaintiff deadline in the class action. The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for Mazor investors under the federal securities laws.
To join the Mazor class action, go to the firm’s website at http://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-1144.html or call Phillip Kim, Esq. or Kevin Chan, Esq. toll free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or kchan@rosenlegal.com for more information on the class action. NO CLASS HAS YET BEEN CERTIFIED IN THE ABOVE ACTION. UNTIL A CLASS IS CERTIFIED, YOU ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL UNLESS YOU RETAIN ONE. YOU MAY ALSO REMAIN AN ABSENT CLASS MEMBER AND DO NOTHING AT THIS POINT. YOU MAY RETAIN COUNSEL OF YOUR CHOICE. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period defendants issued false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Mazor was engaged in conduct that subjected it to ISA investigation; (2) as such, Mazor was exposed to potential liability; and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about Mazor’s business, operations, and prospects, were false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 8, 2017. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. If you wish to join the litigation, go to the firm’s website at http://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-1144.html for more information.

2.1 Renaissance Guidance System


3 References



History[edit]
The formation of the company started with research in surgical robotics at the Robotic Laboratory of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in Haifa, Israel in the 1990s. In 2001, the company was founded[7] by Professor Moshe Shoham, and Eli Zehavi. Prof. Shoham is the Head of the Medical Robotics Laboratory of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Technion and Mr. Zehavi was a former Vice President of Engineering at Elscint. During 2001-2002, the company was based in the Technion campus’s incubator offices T3 ~ Technion Technology Transfer which transfers innovative technology developed at Technion to commercialization for global markets. The company was originally incorporated under the name M.A.S.O.R. Surgical Technologies, then later changed its name to Mazor Surgical Technologies. In 2010, the company took its current name today - Mazor Robotics. Mazor Robotics very first product, SpineAssist, was approved by the FDA in 2004.[8]
Renaissance Guidance System, Mazor's next generation product, was released commercially in 2011.[9]
In 2003, Ori Hadomi, former CFO of Denex, was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Mazor Robotics. Mr. Hadomi was also Founder and CEO of 7D Ltd. (motion tracker for medical applications), and Chairman of the Izmel Scientific committee (consortium for the image-guided industry).
The company raised US$7 million from several Venture Capital funds. The company then relocated to its current offices in the Caesarea Industrial Park in Caesarea, Israel.
In early 2004, Mazor Robotics received its first CE mark for its initial product, SpineAssist. With this important milestone for the company, SpineAssist became the first commercially available mechanical guidance system for spine surgery. The company began marketing SpineAssist in Europe, registering its first sale soon afterwards. Later in 2004, the company also received its first FDA clearance for SpineAssist and became the first FDA approved robotic system for spinal surgery.[10] In June 2011, the company launched its current robotic device, Renaissance Guidance System, which replaced the former SpineAssist model.[11] In Feb. 2014 Prof. Shoham was elected into the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) for contributions to robotic technology for image-guided surgery.[12]
Technology[edit]
Professor Moshe Shoham invented the SmartAssist platform that was the basis for the company’s initial technology. With the company’s first product, SpineAssist, challenges included: matching of the pre-operative images to the intraoperative CT scan and customizing the technology for different spine applications, such as deformity and minimally-invasive degenerative repair.[13]
Renaissance Guidance System[edit]
Renaissance is the Mazor Robotics next generation surgical guidance system with 1.5 mm accuracy (FDA 510(k) filing). Studies have also shown a reduction in the amount of fluoroscopy used, especially for minimally invasive surgeries (MIS).[14] Other studies have also proven Renaissance impact in challenging spine surgery cases such as scoliosis and other complex spinal deformity cases.[15]

				Mazor Robotics Ltd. Expands Leadership Organization 





Caesarea, Israel – June 19, 2017 – Mazor Robotics Ltd. (TASE: MZOR; NASDAQGM: MZOR), a pioneer and leader in the field of surgical guidance systems, today announced leadership additions and organizational steps to position the company for its next phase of growth. According to Mr. Ori Hadomi, CEO of Mazor Robotics Ltd., “In 2016, we announced and set in motion a plan to accelerate growth with the signing of strategic agreements and the launch of the transformative Mazor X platform. The new hires complement the capabilities of the existing team, positioning Mazor for additional growth opportunities as well as leading our more than 200 employees. I believe that our expanded leadership team maximizes Mazor’s near and long term potential.”
The Company has formed an integrated Product Development Group combining the current R&D and Product groups into a unified department. The newly formed Product Development group creates operational synergy to address market needs and to continue development of innovative spine products and future product enhancements. The department is to be headed by Oren Zarchin, Ph.D. who joins Mazor in the role of Vice President, Product Development. Dr. Zarchin’s most recent position was as Director at Philips Healthcare leading multi-disciplinary R&D teams and product platforms. This change is effective August 1, 2017. In addition, Mazor has established the Advanced Technology Group and Mr. Eli Zehavi is appointed Executive Vice President of Advanced Technologies.

This change is effective August 1, 2017. Mazor has also created a new position, Vice President of Operations and Service, and recruited Mr. Joshua Belkar, an industry veteran with more than 20 years of experience in the medical device industry including a long tenure at Medtronic (Given Imaging) as Director of Operations.

Mazor Robotics, Ltd. (Hebrew: מזור רובוטיקה בע"מ) is a medical device company and manufacturer of a robotic guidance system for spine surgery.[1]
Surgeons that utilize Mazor Robotics Renaissance generally specialize in orthopedic surgery or neurosurgery. Mazor Robotics US headquarters are located in Orlando, Florida[2] with international offices in Caesarea, Israel and Münster, Germany.
Its flagship product, Renaissance, is cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)[3] and CE-marked for both spine and brain surgery[4][5]
The company has been listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange since 2007 and as of May 2013 has a dual listing on NASDAQ. As of September 2013, Mazor Robotics technology is installed in 54 hospitals (28 in the US alone) and has been used in more than 4,000 procedures worldwide.[6]

2.1 Renaissance Guidance System


3 References



History[edit]
The formation of the company started with research in surgical robotics at the Robotic Laboratory of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in Haifa, Israel in the 1990s. In 2001, the company was founded[7] by Professor Moshe Shoham, and Eli Zehavi. Prof. Shoham is the Head of the Medical Robotics Laboratory of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Technion and Mr. Zehavi was a former Vice President of Engineering at Elscint. During 2001-2002, the company was based in the Technion campus’s incubator offices T3 ~ Technion Technology Transfer which transfers innovative technology developed at Technion to commercialization for global markets. The company was originally incorporated under the name M.A.S.O.R. Surgical Technologies, then later changed its name to Mazor Surgical Technologies. In 2010, the company took its current name today - Mazor Robotics. Mazor Robotics very first product, SpineAssist, was approved by the FDA in 2004.[8]
Renaissance Guidance System, Mazor's next generation product, was released commercially in 2011.[9]
In 2003, Ori Hadomi, former CFO of Denex, was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Mazor Robotics. Mr. Hadomi was also Founder and CEO of 7D Ltd. (motion tracker for medical applications), and Chairman of the Izmel Scientific committee (consortium for the image-guided industry).
The company raised US$7 million from several Venture Capital funds. The company then relocated to its current offices in the Caesarea Industrial Park in Caesarea, Israel.
In early 2004, Mazor Robotics received its first CE mark for its initial product, SpineAssist. With this important milestone for the company, SpineAssist became the first commercially available mechanical guidance system for spine surgery. The company began marketing SpineAssist in Europe, registering its first sale soon afterwards. Later in 2004, the company also received its first FDA clearance for SpineAssist and became the first FDA approved robotic system for spinal surgery.[10] In June 2011, the company launched its current robotic device, Renaissance Guidance System, which replaced the former SpineAssist model.[11] In Feb. 2014 Prof. Shoham was elected into the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) for contributions to robotic technology for image-guided surgery.[12]
Technology[edit]
Professor Moshe Shoham invented the SmartAssist platform that was the basis for the company’s initial technology. With the company’s first product, SpineAssist, challenges included: matching of the pre-operative images to the intraoperative CT scan and customizing the technology for different spine applications, such as deformity and minimally-invasive degenerative repair.[13]
Renaissance Guidance System[edit]
Renaissance is the Mazor Robotics next generation surgical guidance system with 1.5 mm accuracy (FDA 510(k) filing). Studies have also shown a reduction in the amount of fluoroscopy used, especially for minimally invasive surgeries (MIS).[14] Other studies have also proven Renaissance impact in challenging spine surgery cases such as scoliosis and other complex spinal deformity cases.[15]

Mazor Robotics, Ltd. (Hebrew: מזור רובוטיקה בע"מ) is a medical device company and manufacturer of a robotic guidance system for spine surgery.[1]
Surgeons that utilize Mazor Robotics Renaissance generally specialize in orthopedic surgery or neurosurgery. Mazor Robotics US headquarters are located in Orlando, Florida[2] with international offices in Caesarea, Israel and Münster, Germany.
Its flagship product, Renaissance, is cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)[3] and CE-marked for both spine and brain surgery[4][5]
The company has been listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange since 2007 and as of May 2013 has a dual listing on NASDAQ. As of September 2013, Mazor Robotics technology is installed in 54 hospitals (28 in the US alone) and has been used in more than 4,000 procedures worldwide.[6]

History[edit]
The formation of the company started with research in surgical robotics at the Robotic Laboratory of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in Haifa, Israel in the 1990s. In 2001, the company was founded[7] by Professor Moshe Shoham, and Eli Zehavi. Prof. Shoham is the Head of the Medical Robotics Laboratory of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Technion and Mr. Zehavi was a former Vice President of Engineering at Elscint. During 2001-2002, the company was based in the Technion campus’s incubator offices T3 ~ Technion Technology Transfer which transfers innovative technology developed at Technion to commercialization for global markets. The company was originally incorporated under the name M.A.S.O.R. Surgical Technologies, then later changed its name to Mazor Surgical Technologies. In 2010, the company took its current name today - Mazor Robotics. Mazor Robotics very first product, SpineAssist, was approved by the FDA in 2004.[8]
Renaissance Guidance System, Mazor's next generation product, was released commercially in 2011.[9]
In 2003, Ori Hadomi, former CFO of Denex, was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Mazor Robotics. Mr. Hadomi was also Founder and CEO of 7D Ltd. (motion tracker for medical applications), and Chairman of the Izmel Scientific committee (consortium for the image-guided industry).
The company raised US$7 million from several Venture Capital funds. The company then relocated to its current offices in the Caesarea Industrial Park in Caesarea, Israel.
In early 2004, Mazor Robotics received its first CE mark for its initial product, SpineAssist. With this important milestone for the company, SpineAssist became the first commercially available mechanical guidance system for spine surgery. The company began marketing SpineAssist in Europe, registering its first sale soon afterwards. Later in 2004, the company also received its first FDA clearance for SpineAssist and became the first FDA approved robotic system for spinal surgery.[10] In June 2011, the company launched its current robotic device, Renaissance Guidance System, which replaced the former SpineAssist model.[11] In Feb. 2014 Prof. Shoham was elected into the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) for contributions to robotic technology for image-guided surgery.[12]
Technology[edit]
Professor Moshe Shoham invented the SmartAssist platform that was the basis for the company’s initial technology. With the company’s first product, SpineAssist, challenges included: matching of the pre-operative images to the intraoperative CT scan and customizing the technology for different spine applications, such as deformity and minimally-invasive degenerative repair.[13]
Renaissance Guidance System[edit]
Renaissance is the Mazor Robotics next generation surgical guidance system with 1.5 mm accuracy (FDA 510(k) filing). Studies have also shown a reduction in the amount of fluoroscopy used, especially for minimally invasive surgeries (MIS).[14] Other studies have also proven Renaissance impact in challenging spine surgery cases such as scoliosis and other complex spinal deformity cases.[15]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
