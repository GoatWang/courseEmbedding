Sally Smith

Sally J Smith, Environmental Artist
A professional watercolour painter for over 20 years, the artist recently began creating environmental art sculptures out in nature. The works fall into 2 different genre; "Faerie Houses" - which are just as the name suggests, and "Eartherials"- sculptures which have their roots in the earthy elements yet also embody certain otherworldly qualities. She works year-round and in all weather conditions at various locations near her Adirondack mountain studio. Her images are widely collected across the planet and available as prints, greeting cards, calendars, etc. She has just recently finished creating a DVD featuring over 350 sculptures set to lyrical piano music by Canadian artist, Bradfield.
"I create my sculptures year-round in the richly textured landscape of the Adirondack Mountains of northern New York. Working in the moment with materials I find in nature the finished pieces have a sense of unity and harmony, as if they belong to the land which formed them. And yet, there is a deep spiritual quality present in the works as well that always hints of worlds beyond our own.

My art arises out of an alchemical blending of elements from the natural world, both in materials and location working in a true collaboration with the environment itself. My hope is that the images can capture some of the timeless mystery and magic that I feel when I first view a completed sculpture – a sense that it is truly possible to live in a new way of respectful resonance with the living Earth."

Environmental artist Sally J Smith's second book captures in beautiful images the best of her work from the previous year. 56 pages, with either one or two large, sumptuous images per page take the viewer through the creative cycle of one year. A short description to go with each image.
Suitable for all ages will make an inspiring and unusual gift for anyone who loves nature, Faeries or just plain amazing art.
******* PLEASE note... the preview selections are low resolution (96 dpi) to make for faster uploading. The actual book photos are high quality (300 dpi) and are very crisp and clear.

                                I am in love with these sculptures!! By way of Sally's environmental sculpture work I live vicariously through her, as I just do not get outside like she does to play with all the nature beings. Such beauty she weaves together in collaboration with the beauty Mother Earth provides. A perfect symbiosis.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

 The Fairy Houses wall calendar reveals a magical world of handcrafted faerie castles and cottages, fanciful fairy retreats and sanctuaries, and habitable hobbit hideaways. Celebrated environmental artist Sally J. Smith builds these exquisite creations from materials found in the wild. Each house begins as a collection of bark, twigs, mosses, and stones and is finished with touches of fragile blossoms, ferns, and butterfly wings that add to their ethereal beauty. When complete, the houses are placed in a natural setting so perfectly suited that they seem surely to have been crafted by fairy hands.  12" x 12" wall calendar (12" x 24" open). A year of fantastic fairy houses on your wall. Frameable artbook-quality printing. The perfect gift for the fantasy, fairy tale, and nature art lover. Exceptional photographs of magical fairy houses in forests and fields. Printed on paper sourced from a combination of sustainably managed forests and recycled materials. Published by Amber Lotus, an independent carbon-negative US company that has planted more than half a million trees since 2008. This calendar features US and Canadian legal holidays, phases of the moon, and important observances of the world's major religions.  Children and adults alike will find inspiration and delight in this creative expression of land art.

About the Author


Sally J. Smith was a professional watercolor artist and children's book illustrator for more than 20 years before turning her talents to environmental sculptures. Her fairy houses and Eartherials echo the beauty of a special place or moment in time. Smith creates a visual record of a piece at its completion, and whenever possible, after the sculpture is photographed, it is left where it was made for the nature spirits to enjoy. She lives in the Adirondacks, where resources for her magical creations abound.

Welcome to Greenspirit Arts

































 
 


 


 






As the world around us seems to be spinning faster and faster with more layers of technology between our souls and this beautiful, magical planet upon which we live, Greenspirit Arts offers a respite, a sanctuary, a place to refresh and reconnect through the Environmental Art of 
professional artist Sally J Smith.
 
Here you will find magical visions of Faerie Houses made from real leaves, moss and stone (and many other natural materials) as well as the stunning sculptures the artist calls “Eartherials” which echo the beauty of a special place or moment in time. Each sculpture, often created on site regardless of season or weather, is a celebration of the intimate dialog between the artist and the environment that informs the work. The artist then creates a visual record of the piece at its completion and whenever possible, after the sculpture is photographed, it is left where it was made for the Nature Spirits to enjoy.

Fans of Greenspirit Arts may easily purchase products here which feature the artist’s work. Your support is very much appreciated. The DVD is an especially popular gift item as it vividly shows over 300 of the artist’s creations. Various features will be added to this website as time permits so come back often to see what is taking root or blossoming in full. You are invited to visit the Greenspirit Arts blog where the artist has written about her sculptures, her process and other tales from the woods. 


Thank you for visiting the evolving home for Greenspirit Arts. Please feel free to sign up for the GSA newsletter to be kept informed of when new products or website features become available. 

Come back again soon!

Environmental artist, Sally J Smith's enchanting Faerie Houses transport the viewer into another dimension. Ordinary rocks, moss, leaves and flowers are transformed into magical dwellings for the wee folk --- and for the rest of us as well! With over 70 full color images, this book will bring joyful smiles to viewers of all ages.

***

Please note: the images in the preview selection are lower resolution versions of the book pages. The actual book images are of MUCH high resolution (300dpi) and of excellent quality. Using the lower resolution for the preview enables faster loading of the pages. Some people have thought that the preview images are actual representations of the book pages, but the book photos are much nicer. ----  To find out more about my work, please visit my blog at: www.greenspiritarts.blogspot.com

                                This is a beautiful book! The magical little houses are in the perfect settings and almost make me wish I were a faerie so I could live in them. Expertly photographed, the art in this book would be more at home displayed on walls than between covers. Sally does exquisite work, and details it on her delightful blog. I thoroughly enjoy everything she shares with us! geni

                                "Ken Anderson" The photographs in this book are really fantastic. I highly recomend it to everyone especially those with small children or grandchildren who can still believe in the magical world of fairies.

                                "I can't wait for the movie!" My first two copies of Faerie Houses 2007 arrived today, and I’m delighted. The book is beautifully and thoughtfully laid out, and the size is perfect for throwing in my bag to take with me. Kids really love this work, and it seems to have an evocative power that pushes instantly beyond fantasy drawings and paintings - it takes you there!

Overview



From the USA Today bestselling writing team of Sally J. Smith & Jean Steffens comes a hilarious first book in a brand new mystery series that will keep you guessing until the end...Melanie Hamilton is not your average artist. She brings home the bacon by inking tattoos at New Orleans's Mansion at Mystic Isle, a resort in the middle of the bayou that caters to fans of the peculiar and paranormal, but her true passion comes alive when she volunteers restoring Katrina-ravaged landmarks. Between her day job, her restoration work, and selling her paintings in Jackson Square, Mel's life is more hectic than Bourbon Street on Fat Tuesday. But when a guest of the resort, a millionaire's widow, is poisoned, and Melanie's close friend is arrested for the murder, things go from hectic to downright dangerous.Mel joins forces with the resort's delish manager, Jack Stockton, to prove her friend's innocence. Soon they find themselves dealing with séances, secret passages, the ghost of the millionaire himself, gators, swamp rats, and a sinister killer who proves that not everything is what it seems in the Louisiana bayou.Come on along, and get your creep on.Mystic Isle Mysteries:Mystic Mayhem (book #1)Mystic Mojo (shorts story in the Killer Beach Reads collection)Mystic Mistletoe Murder (book #2)What critics are saying about Sally J.

Classy with a twist of wry humor and just enough sentiment and romance to reel you in and keep you hanging until the end. Smith and Steffens, partners in crime, have struck gold.—Kathleen M. Rodgers, author of Johnnie Come Lately and The Final Salute"Stealing the Moon & Stars is an impossible book to put down. Jordan and Eddie are the best mystery solving duo since Nick and Nora. Is there a fire alarm ringing? Because their relationship is smokin’ hot!”—Jenn McKinlay, New York Times bestselling author of the Cupcake Bakery Mysteries and the Library Lover’s Mysteries"The action and sexual tension are as hot as an Arizona summer.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
