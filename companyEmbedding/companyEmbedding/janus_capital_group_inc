LONDON and DENVER, May  30, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Janus Capital Group Inc. and Henderson Group plc today announce the completion of an all-stock merger of equals to form Janus Henderson Group plc (Janus Henderson).  Concurrent with Henderson Group plc's  delisting from the London Stock Exchange, today Janus Henderson lists its shares on the New York Stock Exchange(NYSE) under the ticker symbol "JHG" (NYSE:JHG).  Janus Henderson securities will also continue trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on a deferred settlement basis up to the close of trading on 2 June 2017 under the code HGGDA, and on a normal settlement basis on and from 5 June 2017, with normal settlement trading in Janus Henderson securities on the ASX taking place under the ticker symbol "HGG" up to the close of trading on 9 June 2017.  On and from 13 June 2017, Janus Henderson securities will trade on the ASX under the ticker symbol "JHG" (ASX:JHG).  The group will market its products and services as Janus Henderson Investors with immediate effect.
Janus Henderson is a leading global active asset manager that:

Manages assets under management (AUM) of approximately U.S.$331 billion (as at 31 March, 2017)1 with a market capitalization of approximately U.S.$6 billion
Features significant scale, diverse products and investment strategies, and depth and breadth in global distribution
Leverages Janus's strength in the U.S. markets and Henderson's strength in the U.K. and European markets, creating a truly global active asset manager with a diverse geographic footprint
Expected attractive growth potential and annual run rate pre-tax net cost synergies of at least U.S.$110 million, should deliver compelling value for shareholders


1 Pro forma combined pre-merger figures of Janus Capital Group and Henderson Group, as at 31 March 2017.  Combined AUM excludes U.S.$3 billion of Exchange-traded Notes as Janus Henderson is not the named advisor or subadvisor.  Exchange rate used for translation from GBP to USD: 1.25
Andrew Formica, Janus Henderson's Co-Chief Executive Officer, said: "At our core, Janus Henderson is focused on delivering for our clients.  Our work together since announcement has reinforced our shared culture and aligned business goals.  The breadth and depth of investment professionals and the broad array of talented colleagues gives us an enviable position to meet our clients' needs."
Dick Weil, Janus Henderson's Co-Chief Executive Officer, said: "The combined firm, Janus Henderson, creates a truly global active asset manager that is well-positioned to succeed in the investment marketplace, with expanded product suites, greater financial strength and better talent, benefiting our clients, shareholders and employees."

Change of Name 
Pursuant to shareholder approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 26 April 2017, it is confirmed that the name of the company has today changed to Janus Henderson Group plc.
Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association
Pursuant to shareholder approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 26 April 2017, it is confirmed that the amended memorandum and articles of the Company came into effect today. The amended memorandum and articles of association are set out below at Schedule A.
Confirmation of de-Listing from the London Stock Exchange
It is confirmed that today, following the relevant notice period, the listing of Janus Henderson's shares on the Official List has been cancelled and Janus Henderson shares have ceased trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange.
Confirmation of Share Consolidation on a ‘10 to 1' basis
Pursuant to shareholder approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 26 April 2017, it is confirmed that all shares in issue at 6.00pm on 26 May 2017 were consolidated. Under the share consolidation, every 10 ordinary shares with a nominal value of U.S.$0.15 were converted into one ordinary share of U.S.$1.50 and the same ratio was also applied to Chess Depositary Interests (CDIs) in Australia
Confirmation of Issue of Shares
Pursuant to shareholder approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 26 April 2017, it is confirmed that 87,220,743 ordinary shares (and additionally 1,184 aggregated fractions to be sold) with a nominal value of U.S.$1.50 each were issued to Janus stockholders in connection with the Merger.
As at 30 May 2017, Janus Henderson Group plc's capital consists of 200,406,138 ordinary shares with a nominal value of U.S.$1.50 each with voting rights. Janus Henderson Group plc holds nil shares in treasury.
The above figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, Janus Henderson Group plc. 
Shares issued to Dai-ichi
Of the 87,220,743 ordinary shares (and additionally 1,184 aggregated fractions to be sold) with a nominal value of U.S.$1.50 each, which were issued to Janus stockholders in connection with the Merger, 17,168,922 shares were issued to Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc. 
Under the Amended and Restated Investment and Strategic Cooperation Agreement between Dai-ichi and Janus Henderson, subject to certain limited exceptions, Dai-ichi may not transfer these shares without Janus Henderson's written consent during the period up to and including 3 October 2019.
Dai-ichi also purchased 20 tranches of conditional options granted by Janus Henderson on 3 October 2016.  Each tranche allows Dai-ichi to subscribe for or purchase 500,000 Janus Henderson ordinary shares at a strike price of 2,997.2 pence per share. The options are exercisable from closing of the Merger until 3  October 2018. In aggregate, if exercised at closing, the options sold to Dai-ichi would entitle them to purchase approximately 5% additional of the ordinary shares of Janus Henderson. The total amount Dai-ichi paid for the options was £19.8 million, which was payable on closing.
Co-Chief Executives' Remuneration Arrangements
Both Andrew Formica and Richard Weil's surviving terms of employment remain unchanged at Janus Henderson. Andrew Formica's key terms of employment have been previously disclosed. A summary of Richard Weil's key terms of employment are set out in Schedule B. The new Board of Janus Henderson will review the Co-Chief Executives' remuneration in due course.

This announcement contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the financial condition, results and business of Janus, Henderson and the combined business. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "seek," "target," "outlook," "estimate," "forecast," "project" and other similar words and expressions, and variations or negatives of these words.  Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, subject to numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which change over time and are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and investors and security holders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.  Because forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from the results expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance.   Janus Henderson does not assume any duty and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, nor does Janus Henderson intend to do so, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.  For any forward-looking statements made in this communication or in any documents, Janus Henderson claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Nothing in this announcement should be construed as a profit forecast.

Janus Capital Group Inc. Announces Agreement to Acquire Exchange 
      Traded Product Provider VelocityShares






October 13, 2014 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Janus Capital Group Inc. (NYSE:JNS) today announced it has agreed to 
      acquire VS Holdings Inc., the parent company of VelocityShares, LLC 
      ("VelocityShares"), a leading provider of unique institutionally-focused 
      exchange-traded products (“ETPs”), including exchange-traded funds 
      (“ETFs”), that deliver sophisticated volatility management solutions. As 
      a leader in designing differentiated ETPs and strategies, VelocityShares 
      is focused on developing instruments that enable investors to manage 
      risk and has been delivering innovative products for a wide range of 
      global investors since its launch in 2009. The transaction includes an 
      initial upfront cash consideration of $30 million and is expected to 
      close in the fourth quarter of 2014. Closing of the transaction is 
      subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval.
    


      “This acquisition positions Janus within the rapidly growing rules-based 
      and active ETF universe, enhancing the customized solutions we can 
      provide to our clients and enabling us to work with the growing segment 
      of financial advisors and institutions focused on these instruments,” 
      said Richard M. Weil, Chief Executive Officer of Janus Capital Group. 
      “Today’s announcement is a continuation of our strategy of intelligent 
      diversification, adding new talent to support innovation and smart 
      solutions for our clients. We are excited to have the VelocityShares 
      team join our organization, and we are confident their expertise and 
      product innovation capabilities will be beneficial to our clients and 
      shareholders.”
    

      VelocityShares was founded in 2009 and is managed by Nick Cherney, 
      Richard Hoge and Steve Quinn. VelocityShares’ initial growth was driven 
      by the development of exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”) in the volatility 
      and commodity space. The company quickly developed a market leading 
      position in tactical trading products serving short-term investors and 
      traders by focusing on helping clients develop sophisticated trading 
      strategies and volatility management solutions. These products will 
      continue to be distributed by the VelocityShares team through its 
      existing distribution channels. VelocityShares has more recently 
      leveraged its expertise to launch a second business around innovative 
      and intelligent ETFs for diversified long-term investment portfolios, 
      currently focused on volatility hedged equities and equal risk weighted 
      solutions. These ETF offerings, along with future product innovation, 
      offer significant synergies between VelocityShares and Janus. 
      VelocityShares is headquartered in Darien, Connecticut and employs 11 
      professionals, many of whom are ETF industry veterans and have extensive 
      product development, product structuring and sales experience. As of 
      September 30, 2014, it has raised $2 billion in assets.
    

      “Janus’ global distribution network and commitment to product 
      development creates very unique opportunities to deliver institutional 
      quality ETFs to a wide range of investors,” said Nick Cherney, 
      Co-Founder and Chief Investment Officer of VelocityShares. “Our combined 
      company will be well positioned to grow our ETP business and continue to 
      be a leading provider in the market place.”

      First quarter 2017 revenues of $257.6 million increased from the fourth 
      quarter 2016 due to higher investment management fees as a result of 
      higher average assets under management. First quarter 2017 operating 
      expenses of $202.3 million increased $12.7 million from fourth quarter 
      operating expenses of $189.6 million, primarily due to increased 
      marketing and advertising expenses related to the proposed merger of JCG 
      and Henderson Group plc (“Henderson”). JCG also had seasonally higher 
      employee compensation expenses, partially offset by lower merger-related 
      costs within general and administrative expenses compared to the fourth 
      quarter 2016.
    

Capital and Liquidity


      At March 31, 2017, JCG had total equity of $1.7 billion, cash and 
      investments of $655.8 million and outstanding debt of $407.4 million.
    

      Cash flows from operations during the first quarter 2017 were $(50.1) 
      million compared with $94.8 million during the fourth quarter 2016 and 
      $(44.0) million during the first quarter 2016. The change in cash flows 
      from operations comparing the first quarter 2017 to the fourth quarter 
      2016 is due to the payment of annual incentive compensation in the first 
      quarter 2017.
    

      On April 18, 2017, JCG’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly 
      cash dividend of $0.11 per share. The quarterly dividend will be paid on 
      May 19, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 
      5, 2017.

Notes:





          (1)
        

           
        

          Growth / Core and Fixed Income assets and flows reflect an even 
          split of the Janus Balanced Fund between the two categories.
        



          (2)
        



          ETN sales and redemptions across all periods (exclusive of the first 
          and second quarters 2016) were adjusted due to a revised reporting 
          method by the subsidiary; ending and average assets were not 
          impacted.
        



          (3)
        



          Assets and flows in 2016 reflect a recategorization of the Janus 
          Global Real Estate Fund from the Growth / Core to Global / 
          International discipline.
        



          (4)
        



          First quarter 2017 gross sales and redemptions exclude an 
          intra-strategy transfer of $1.6 billion from a Danish 
          krone-denominated account into a U.S. dollar-denominated account.
        







           
        







           
        



Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared 
      in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
      United States of America (“GAAP”). To provide greater transparency into 
      JCG’s business on an ongoing operations basis and allow more appropriate 
      comparisons with industry peers, the Company presents adjusted operating 
      income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to 
      JCG and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to JCG common 
      shareholders as non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP 
      financial measures is considered to be effective indicators, for both 
      management and investors, of JCG’s financial performance over time. The 
      non-GAAP financial measures exclude expenses incurred during the three 
      months ended March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 related to the merger 
      with Henderson as these expenses are not considered part of the 
      Company’s ongoing operations. Management uses non-GAAP performance 
      measures to evaluate the business on an ongoing basis, and they are 
      consistent with internal management reporting. The most directly 
      comparable GAAP measures are operating income, operating margin, net 
      income attributable to JCG and diluted earnings per share attributable 
      to JCG common shareholders.
    

      These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any 
      measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to 
      other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional 
      reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures 
      if deemed appropriate. The tax effect related to reconciling items has 
      been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction 
      to which the transaction relates.
    

      The following are reconciliations of GAAP basis operating income, 
      operating margin, net income attributable to JCG and diluted earnings 
      per share attributable to JCG common shareholders to adjusted operating 
      income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to 
      JCG and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to JCG common 
      shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and December 31, 
      2016. The Company did not adjust its GAAP basis figures for the three 
      months ended March 31, 2016 as the amounts during this period reflect 
      JCG’s business on an ongoing operations basis. Amounts are presented in 
      millions, except per share data and operating profit percentages.

      “Complex-Wide Mutual Funds” means all affiliated mutual funds managed by 
      Janus, INTECH and Perkins. “Fundamental Equity Mutual Funds” means all 
      mutual funds managed by Janus or Perkins that invest in equity

      result in differences in performance.
    

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and 
      fluctuation of value. Performance may be affected by risks that include 
      those associated with non-diversification, portfolio turnover, short 
      sales, potential conflicts of interest, foreign and emerging markets, 
      initial public offerings (IPOs), high-yield and high-risk securities, 
      undervalued, overlooked and smaller capitalization companies, real 
      estate related securities including Real Estate Investment Trusts 
      (REITs), derivatives, and commodity-linked investments. Each product has 
      different risks. Please see the prospectus for more information about 
      risks, holdings and other details.


      The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating," is calculated for 
      managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable 
      life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate 
      accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and 
      open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
      comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar 
      Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed 
      product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward 
      variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products 
      in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 
      stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and 
      the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a 
      managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
      figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) 
      Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 
      36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
      rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
      five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total 
      returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the 
      most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period 
      actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three 
      rating periods.
    

      The Morningstar percentile ranking is based on a fund’s total return 
      (including income and capital gains, if any, and excluding sales 
      charges) relative to all funds in the same category for the period. The 
      highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1%, and the lowest (or 
      least favorable) percentile rank is 100%. The top-performing funds in a 
      category will always receive a rank of 1.
    

      Morningstar performance on an asset-weighted basis is calculated by 
      taking all funds and assigning the assets under management (“AUM”) in 
      each respective fund to either the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th quartile bucket 
      based on each fund's respective Morningstar relative ranking. The total 
      AUM of each quartile’s bucket is then divided by complex-wide total AUM 
      to arrive at the respective percent of AUM in each bucket.
    

Please consider the charges, risks, expenses and investment 
      objectives carefully before investing. For a prospectus or, if 
      available, a summary prospectus containing this and other information, 
      please call Janus at 877.335.2687 or download the file from

Janus Capital Group, Inc. was an American publicly owned investment firm headquartered in Denver, Colorado. The company's asset-management disciplines included growth, core, international, value, mathematical, alternative and fixed-income. These products were sold through advisors and financial intermediaries, to institutional investors and directly to retail investors. Janus Capital Group was created as a result of the January 1, 2003, merger of Janus Capital Corporation into its parent company, Stilwell Financial Inc. Janus Capital Group consists of Janus Capital Management LLC (Janus), INTECH Investment Management LLC (INTECH), and Kapstream Capital Pty Limited (Kapstream), in addition to a range of exchange‐traded products. Additionally, Janus Capital Group owns 80% of Perkins Investment Management (formerly Perkins, Wolf, McDonnell and Company).
Outside the U.S., Janus had offices in Sydney, Paris, Zurich, Frankfurt, Dubai, Taipei, London, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Singapore. Janus is in the S&P MidCap 400 Index.[2]
It merged with Henderson Group in May 2017 to create Janus Henderson.
History[edit]
Janus was founded in 1969 by Tom Bailey. A controlling interest was purchased by Kansas City Southern Industries in 1984. Bailey stepped down as president and CEO in June 2002.[3]
The firm was formerly known as Stilwell Financial Incorporated. The company was renamed following the January 2003 merger of Janus Capital Corporation into its parent company, Stilwell Financial.[4]
The Janus Fund opened in 1970 with approximately $500,000,000.35 in assets and 30 investors.[5] Its primary business was U.S. large cap growth equity management.
Further funds were launched in 1985, including the Janus Venture Fund, its first small cap equity fund, and the Janus Twenty Fund, its first concentrated equity fund. At the same time, Janus began managing assets for institutional clients.
In 1991, Janus launched a number of other new types of fund, including its first global equity fund, the Janus Worldwide Fund, its first international equity fund, the Janes Overseas Fund, and its first mid cap equity fund, the Janus Enterprise Fund. It also launched the Janus Aspen Series (JAS), a product line created for investors wanting to invest in Janus through variable insurance contracts or certain qualified retirement plans. Janus also became available through fund supermarkets for both retail shareholders and financial planners.
Myron Scholes, Nobel laureate and Ph.D., joined Janus as chief investment strategist on July 8, 2014[6] On September 26, 2014, Bill Gross left Pimco to join Janus as manager of the Janus global unconstrained bond strategy. In October 2014, Janus acquired VS Holdings, a company based in Darien, Connecticut, and its VelocityShares business.[7] In July 2015, Janus acquired a majority interest in Kapstream Capital, a fixed income specialist.[8] In February 2016, Janus launched a small cap growth and small cap/mid cap growth ETF, [9] followed in June by four new ETFs around investment themes – long-term care, health and fitness, organic foods and personal care (including health care issues related to obesity). On October 3, 2016, Janus Capital Group Inc and Henderson Group plc announced a recommended merger of equals to create Janus Henderson.[10]

Janus Capital Group, Inc. was an American publicly owned investment firm headquartered in Denver, Colorado. The company's asset-management disciplines included growth, core, international, value, mathematical, alternative and fixed-income. These products were sold through advisors and financial intermediaries, to institutional investors and directly to retail investors. Janus Capital Group was created as a result of the January 1, 2003, merger of Janus Capital Corporation into its parent company, Stilwell Financial Inc. Janus Capital Group consists of Janus Capital Management LLC (Janus), INTECH Investment Management LLC (INTECH), and Kapstream Capital Pty Limited (Kapstream), in addition to a range of exchange‐traded products. Additionally, Janus Capital Group owns 80% of Perkins Investment Management (formerly Perkins, Wolf, McDonnell and Company).
Outside the U.S., Janus had offices in Sydney, Paris, Zurich, Frankfurt, Dubai, Taipei, London, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Singapore. Janus is in the S&P MidCap 400 Index.[2]
It merged with Henderson Group in May 2017 to create Janus Henderson.
History[edit]
Janus was founded in 1969 by Tom Bailey. A controlling interest was purchased by Kansas City Southern Industries in 1984. Bailey stepped down as president and CEO in June 2002.[3]
The firm was formerly known as Stilwell Financial Incorporated. The company was renamed following the January 2003 merger of Janus Capital Corporation into its parent company, Stilwell Financial.[4]
The Janus Fund opened in 1970 with approximately $500,000,000.35 in assets and 30 investors.[5] Its primary business was U.S. large cap growth equity management.
Further funds were launched in 1985, including the Janus Venture Fund, its first small cap equity fund, and the Janus Twenty Fund, its first concentrated equity fund. At the same time, Janus began managing assets for institutional clients.
In 1991, Janus launched a number of other new types of fund, including its first global equity fund, the Janus Worldwide Fund, its first international equity fund, the Janes Overseas Fund, and its first mid cap equity fund, the Janus Enterprise Fund. It also launched the Janus Aspen Series (JAS), a product line created for investors wanting to invest in Janus through variable insurance contracts or certain qualified retirement plans. Janus also became available through fund supermarkets for both retail shareholders and financial planners.
Myron Scholes, Nobel laureate and Ph.D., joined Janus as chief investment strategist on July 8, 2014[6] On September 26, 2014, Bill Gross left Pimco to join Janus as manager of the Janus global unconstrained bond strategy. In October 2014, Janus acquired VS Holdings, a company based in Darien, Connecticut, and its VelocityShares business.[7] In July 2015, Janus acquired a majority interest in Kapstream Capital, a fixed income specialist.[8] In February 2016, Janus launched a small cap growth and small cap/mid cap growth ETF, [9] followed in June by four new ETFs around investment themes – long-term care, health and fitness, organic foods and personal care (including health care issues related to obesity). On October 3, 2016, Janus Capital Group Inc and Henderson Group plc announced a recommended merger of equals to create Janus Henderson.[10]

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
