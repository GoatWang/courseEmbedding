At our core, we are entrepreneurs with a passion for building great companies.

The principal of KB Partners has a proven track record of helping young companies transform themselves into market leaders. We have faced many of the issues confronted regularly by the entrepreneurs that we back. Accordingly, our ability to apply our own operating experiences to these challenges enables us to provide hands-on assistance with all aspects of an organization.

Theranica Raises $6M to Combat Migraine








NETANYA, Israel, July 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
Theranica Bio-Electronics, a bio-medical technology company developing advanced electroceuticals for migraine and other prevalent diseases, announced the closing of its round A of financing, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Other investors participating in the round are LionBird venture capital firm and Corundum Open Innovation.
The funds, totaling about $6M will be used mainly to complete the regulatory process of the company's first product, for acute treatment of migraine, and to bring the product to mass production.
Established in 2016, Theranica deploys advanced electronics and wireless communication technologies, combined with recent advancements in the research of neurology, to develop a line of "electroceuticals" - drug-free solutions for a few medical conditions, starting with migraine.
"This investment finds the company in the midst of its pivotal clinical study, which is being conducted now in 8 hospitals and clinics in the USA and Israel", said Alon Ironi, CEO and co-founder of Theranica. "This is a major step in our regulatory pathway. In parallel to completing this study, we develop solutions for additional debilitating diseases".
"This new partnership with Lightspeed and the other investors will give Theranica the mass and muscle to address the huge potential of the rapidly increasing market for effective solutions for migraine", said Dr. Shimon Eckhouse, Theranica's chairman of the board.  
"With more than 32 million Americans suffering from migraine, this is a problem yet to be solved", said Professor Stephen Silberstein, director of the Jefferson Headache Center in Philadelphia and former president of the American Headache Society, who serves on the company's medical advisory board. "Based on the promising clinical evidence produced so far by Theranica, as well as the simplicity of use and low cost of their innovative device, the company's solution has the potential to become the first line of acute treatment for migraine".
"We are witnessing tectonic changes in the perception and understanding of healthcare technology and services", said Yoni Cheifetz, a partner with Lightspeed. "Healthcare professionals and consumers worldwide realize the dangerous impacts of pain killer addiction. Theranica's product (still in investigational phase) brings a drug-free, risk-free solution for hundreds of millions of migraineurs worldwide, which may rid them from the need to consume conventional drug-based pain killers. "
About Theranica: Theranica is a medical device company, founded in 2016 by Alon Ironi, Ronen Jashek, Slava Barabash and Dr. Shimon Eckhouse, with the vision of combining advanced neuromodulation therapy with modern wireless technology to develop proprietary electroceuticals that address prevalent medical conditions and diseases.

NETANYA, Israel, July 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
Theranica Bio-Electronics, a bio-medical technology company developing advanced electroceuticals for migraine and other prevalent diseases, announced the closing of its round A of financing, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Other investors participating in the round are LionBird venture capital firm and Corundum Open Innovation.
The funds, totaling about $6M will be used mainly to complete the regulatory process of the company's first product, for acute treatment of migraine, and to bring the product to mass production.
Established in 2016, Theranica deploys advanced electronics and wireless communication technologies, combined with recent advancements in the research of neurology, to develop a line of "electroceuticals" - drug-free solutions for a few medical conditions, starting with migraine.
"This investment finds the company in the midst of its pivotal clinical study, which is being conducted now in 8 hospitals and clinics in the USA and Israel", said Alon Ironi, CEO and co-founder of Theranica. "This is a major step in our regulatory pathway. In parallel to completing this study, we develop solutions for additional debilitating diseases".
"This new partnership with Lightspeed and the other investors will give Theranica the mass and muscle to address the huge potential of the rapidly increasing market for effective solutions for migraine", said Dr. Shimon Eckhouse, Theranica's chairman of the board.  
"With more than 32 million Americans suffering from migraine, this is a problem yet to be solved", said Professor Stephen Silberstein, director of the Jefferson Headache Center in Philadelphia and former president of the American Headache Society, who serves on the company's medical advisory board. "Based on the promising clinical evidence produced so far by Theranica, as well as the simplicity of use and low cost of their innovative device, the company's solution has the potential to become the first line of acute treatment for migraine".
"We are witnessing tectonic changes in the perception and understanding of healthcare technology and services", said Yoni Cheifetz, a partner with Lightspeed. "Healthcare professionals and consumers worldwide realize the dangerous impacts of pain killer addiction. Theranica's product (still in investigational phase) brings a drug-free, risk-free solution for hundreds of millions of migraineurs worldwide, which may rid them from the need to consume conventional drug-based pain killers. "
About Theranica: Theranica is a medical device company, founded in 2016 by Alon Ironi, Ronen Jashek, Slava Barabash and Dr. Shimon Eckhouse, with the vision of combining advanced neuromodulation therapy with modern wireless technology to develop proprietary electroceuticals that address prevalent medical conditions and diseases.

In
May of 2014, Viola Credit funds led a Management Buyout transaction by providing
a $25.6M loan to finance the additional purchase, directly and indirectly, of
Telit Communications shares by certain companies controlled by Oozi Cats, CEO
and Executive Director of Telit. The transaction enabled Mr. Cats to assume control
of over 20% ownership in Telit Communications.The
loan carried an annual interest as well as an equity kicker in the form of
Telit shares. A
rise in Telit’s share price, from 195p when the loan was provided to 340p
today, enabled Mr. Cats to repay the loan in full, plus interest. Realization
of Viola Credit’s shares in Telit, (that were given in connection with the
transaction), together with the primarily sum of the loan and the interest,
enabled the fund to generate a total return of $40M to its investors.Telit
is a publicly traded provider of global wireless technology company. The
Company is a global leader in Internet of Things (IoT) enablement. They offer
the industry’s broadest portfolio of integrated products, platforms and
services to support and enable IoT deployments from things to apps. Its
portfolio of modules addresses all cellular communication technologies, GNSS
and short-to-long range wireless applications. Its IoT connectivity plans and
IoT platform services help reduce the risks, time to market, complexity and
costs associated with deploying and providing IoT services across industries
and vertical markets worldwide.

                                            Telco Altice to acquire video ad tech player Teads for $308M

Another telco is buying an adtech firm — today it’s been confirmed that video ad player Teads is being acquired by Dutch telecom Altice, which has some 50 million fixed and mobile subscribers, the majority of whom are in the U.S. and France. Teads claims its global online video advertising marketplace has more than 1.2 billion unique visitors, including 720 million via mobile.Teads is being valued at €285 million (~$308 million) “on a cash and debt free basis” by Altice, with the purchase price subject to it meeting certain revenue targets in 2017. Seventy-five percent of the purchase price will be due at closing — with the remaining quarter becoming payable in early 2018, should targets be met.The pair say they are expecting the acquisition to close in mid-2017, following competition reviews.Teads offers so-called “outstream” video ad format — enabling ads to be displayed outside of a video stream, such as within any content on a webpage, thereby enabling publishers to house video ads without needing to produce their own video content to host the ad inventory. Its revenue grew by 44 percent in 2016 to an estimated €187.7 million.The French company was founded back in 2011, and despite previously talking up the prospect of an IPO, Teads has remained private, while making some acquisitions of its own. It also merged with another adtech firm, Ebuzzing, in 2014.As noted above, there’s a growing trend of telcos going shopping for adtech firms — not least TechCrunch’s parent company AOL’s parent Verizon, which is also in the process of closing in on Yahoo‘s adtech.Altice and Teads say the acquisition rationale is the strategic combination of their assets — citing, for example, the advantage of being able to link Altice’s “unique first party data-sets” (aka the personal data of the 50 million subscribers to its broadband and mobile services) with Teads’ “relationships with 94 of the top 100 advertisers globally” and “partnerships with 500+ premium publishers globally and 8,000 vertically specialized publishers.”In simpler terms, this is about telcos monetizing knowledge of their vast user-bases by finding ways to benefit from serving them targeted premium advertising — and in the U.S. now encouraged by President Trump’s new FCC chairman pick, Ajit Pai, who is a fan of very-light-touch regulation (versus the prior FCC chairman’s intent to expand broadband privacy rules).Commenting in a statement, Michel Combes, CEO of Altice, said: “There is significant incremental value to be generated from our assets. Teads, a powerful business in itself, with major presence in Altice footprint notably in the U.S. and France, will enable us to offer a truly unique value proposition to brands and agencies on the one hand and the media industry, programmers and distributors on the other. It is that value proposition — data-driven, measurable and multiscreen — which will enable us to significantly grow our advertising business. We are very excited to partner with Pierre, Bertrand and their talented team.”While Pierre Chappaz, founder and executive chairman of Teads, added: “Since our inception we have strived to offer our clients with superior advertising solutions based on measurable performance and technological innovation. As part of Altice, we will be able to offer even more tailored, data-driven solutions and take our value proposition from the digital world to a multiscreen platform, which includes TV, digital, mobile and tablets.”Altice’s stock was trading up 1.45 percent following the announcement.

                                            Additional $20M in Funding Secured by Vatbox, a Leader in Automated Vat Recovery and Tax Management

February 20, 2017 - VATBox, a recognized leader in global VAT recovery, today announced the successful completion of a $20 million financing round. The investment by Target Global Fund – with the participation of existing investors Viola Private Equity and other private investors – brings the total equity raised since founding to $50 million. The financing will accelerate VATBox’s international expansion and the rollout of its innovative VAT solutions. 



VATBox was founded in 2013 by CEO Isaac Saft and his partner Noam Guzman, both experienced entrepreneurs with broad experience in the global software market. Together with a team of more than 100 employees, VATBox has successfully streamlined the global VAT recovery process, providing businesses with unrivaled visibility, compliance and data integrity. Leveraging the cloud and utilizing full automation, VATBox provides complete control of a company’s VAT spend, while making the recovery process more productive and yielding higher returns. VATBox serves hundreds of multi-national corporations and Fortune 500 companies around the world, including Eli Lily, Danone, 3M, Nike, Dell, Amazon, and many others.



Indirect taxation is a large market that suffers from limited solutions and few innovations. VATBox has succeeded where many successful companies have failed, thanks to unique technology that optimizes the VAT return process and ensures global regulatory compliance, giving businesses full control over their tax spend and recovery. Over the past several years, the FinTech company has earned wide coverage and recognition from many organizations, including ‒ MasterCard, Citi Bank, Red Herring, Finovate London and others.



Commenting on the announcement, Shmuel Chafets, Partner at Target Global said, “Prior to the era of VATBox, companies were forced to forgo substantial VAT returns and were at risk for non-compliance. VATBox’s impressive client list is proof of the company’s achievements in less than tree years of sales. Apart from the immediate value inherent in the automation of VAT refunds, the company is positioned strategically to deal with the increasing complexity of international taxation. Investment in VATBox is in line with Target Global's strategy to invest in companies with the potential to become market leaders. We believe that within a few years VATBox’s services will become an integral part of the financial infrastructure for every international company.”






Isaac Saft, VATBox CEO, added “This round of financing marks the completion of a challenging and exciting year full of achievements. We are proud of our list of new customers, in the financial returns they earned, and of course in the quality of the products and the added value that we supplied. We feel very fortunate for the opportunity to be active in such an immense market at the right time, providing innovation in the area of tax. We are very excited about the cooperation with Target Global and thank the existing stockholders for their continued support in the company.”

Viola
Credit, the credit arm of Viola Group – Israel’s premier technology
oriented private equity investment group – has announced the completion of four
venture lending deals ranging between 14-40 million NIS each, totalling around
100 million NIS.Viola
Credit provided credit facilities to the following companies: Ctera, a cloud storage enablement company
for enterprises, Feedvisor, the world's first algorithmic repricing and
revenue intelligence platform for online retailers, Cloudyn, which helps enterprises to fully
realize their cloud potential by optimizing hybrid, multi-cloud deployments,
and TradAir, which provides front office optimization
solutions for financial institutions. All four companies are experiencing
accelerated levels of growth and have previously raised substantial funding
rounds from leading VCs.“Viola
Credit portfolio companies are ‘ripe’, in the sense that they are ready to take
significant strides forward – faster”, said Timor Arbel-Sadras, General Partner
at Viola Credit. We are always happy to support
outstanding teams and become their “growth partners”, with a smart funding option
that allows them to “step on the gas” and achieve next-level growth strategies
such as global expansion, acquisition of competing or complementary companies,
etc.” Timor
added, “The scope of investment in Israeli high-tech companies is steadily
growing despite a global slow-down, largely thanks to more reasonable company valuations
locally. The more mature companies in Israel are successfully raising larger financing
rounds than in the past, and this is enabling them to build even larger
companies. The funding
we offer at Viola Credit is a very attractive option in the current market
conditions because it allows companies to increase their cash flow for acquisitions
and organic growth at a lower price, and with less dilution for both the
founders and their investors. Viola Credit specializes in providing unique
solutions that are tailor made for each company based on its requirements and
capabilities, all the while supporting the companies with flexibility and
patience as they continue their journey towards building larger, more
significant companies.”

The company received significant strategic investment, as the round was led by Liberty Interactive’s Liberty Israel Venture Fund, and joined by 31 VENTURES Global Innovation Fund, a CVC fund managed by Global Brain for Mitsui Fudosan, Japan’s leading real estate developer, along with substantial participation from existing investors Battery Ventures, Carmel Ventures, OurCrowd and Stax.

The next step is to arm brokers, lenders, and borrowers with a next generation of tools to help them even further.”



Since its Series A funding, CrediFi has grown its loan database from $1 trillion in commercial loans to $13 trillion, representing over 40 billion square feet of property across the USA.  “Our loans database includes recently added agency data sets from Freddie Mac, HUD, LIHTC, and SBA, among others, which for the first time are aggregated on a single platform alongside the worlds of balance sheet and securitized CRE loans,” continued Razin.

Algorithmic commerce startup Feedvisor is growing quickly, now managing more than $2 billion in goods sold through marketplaces like Amazon and eBay. To fuel that growth, the company has raised an additional $20 million in Series B funding led by General Catalyst.



The Feedvisor platform  uses machine learning to track different market dynamics and optimize the amount of money sellers can make with its dynamic pricing algorithm. At the same time, it also ensures that sellers optimally replenish their inventory.



Founded in Israel, with offices also in New York City and Seattle, the company has raised new funding led by General Catalyst. Along with the financing, GC managing director Larry Bohn is joining the company’s board.



Bohn and GC have made a number of investments in e-commerce and business intelligence startups like Demandware, Bigcommerce, Hubspot, and GoodData, giving him some expertise in how things are bought and sold online.



“Amazon has changed everything, from the way products are manufactured to the way they’re distributed,” Bohn said.



With the expansion of Amazon’s marketplace model and the requirements sellers need to abide by to have their good fulfilled by the online retailer, Bohn points out that sellers need better tools not just for pricing, but for managing inventory and replenishment.



According to Feedvisor CEO Victor Rosenman, the company has been adopted by sellers across a number of verticals. The typical Feedvisor customer is doing at least $1 million in gross merchandise volume (GMV), and the company hopes to attract even larger clients over time.



To pursue that goal, the company plans to double its workforce and heavily expand its New York City office. “It’s very important for us to establish a larger presence in New York,” Bohn said. “It’s the center of commerce and a large group of our customers are there.”



This latest round brings the total amount raised to $33 million,  with previous investors that include Square Peg Capital, JAL Ventures, Oryzn Capital and Micro Angel Fund.

November 28th 2016-  Q Holding announced today that it has entered into an agreement to purchase Degania Silicone Ltd. (“Degania”), a leading international manufacturer of medical catheters. Q Holding is acquiring Degania from Viola Private Equity, Kibbutz Degania Bet and Israel Growth Investors.
Degania represents a transformative acquisition for Q Holding, creating a market-leading medical device and component manufacturer offering complete flexible technology solutions for healthcare applications. With over $85m in revenue the acquisition more than doubles Q Holding's medical sales. Degania produces critical end products that are used on a daily basis in healthcare settings in applications such as cardiology, general surgery and drug delivery. Degania employs c. 1,700 globally and has R&D and manufacturing facilities in Israel, India, France and Slovakia.
Degania goes to market through three brands: Degania, a premier developer and manufacturer of medical catheters for global medical device OEMs; Arthesys, a cardiovascular and peripheral vascular catheter designer and manufacturer specializing in catheters for stent delivery; and Biometrix, a manufacturer and provider of catheter-related kits for hospitals and health care distributors. Across these segments Degania partners with a wide base of global medical device OEM customers that are market leaders in their respective product categories.
Together, Q Holding and Degania will offer an unprecedented suite of development and manufacturing services, material technologies, analytical tools and industry expertise. The combined business will also offer complete product lifecycle management with assembly, packaging and 510K management for customers’ outsourcing needs with a network of operations that can bring the supply chain close to the consumption point.
In November 2014, 3i invested in Q Holding, an Ohio-based manufacturer of highly-engineered, precision-moulded elastomeric components used in a broad range of healthcare and electrical management applications. With over 1,300 employees, the company has design and manufacturing locations in the US, China, the UK and Mexico, and sells products in over 50 countries. Since 3i’s investment, Q has acquired Silicone Altimex, a leading manufacturer of elastomeric tubing for the medical and biopharmaceutical markets in the UK and continental Europe. With 3i’s support, Q has continued its international expansion into Europe, Asia and Mexico, investing in manufacturing facilities and additional commercial resources in each of those regions.
Randy Ross, Chief Executive of Q Holding, commented: “We are delighted to have reached this agreement to purchase Degania. The businesses are highly complementary and the acquisition represents a critical milestone in diversifying and internationalizing the business. It will significantly enhance the value we can deliver to our global customer base thanks to Degania’s strong R&D capabilities in Israel and France and state‐of‐the‐art facilities in Israel, France, India and Slovakia.”
Rami Zajicek, CEO of Degania, added “We are proud of the company that our employees and investors have developed and we see joining forces with Q Holding as the natural next step for Degania to build upon this growth. The alignment of Degania, Q Holding and Qure Medical will benefit customers by providing a greater global network of development and manufacturing resources.”
Richard Relyea, Managing Director 3i North America, commented: “3i is pleased to support Q Holding in this transformative acquisition of Degania. This combination creates a leader in precision elastomeric medical device components and assemblies and advances our goal of building the premier global supplier of engineered elastomeric products for the high growth healthcare and electrical management markets.”

                                            Behalf Raises $27 Million to Accelerate Growth in US Commercial Payments

Viola Growth leads Series C financing round; 


existing investors, Sequoia, Spark, MissionOG and Vintage, participate 


NEW YORK – August 30, 2016 - Behalf, a commercial payment platform specializing in providing small businesses instant point of sale terms at vendors of their choice, today announced it has raised an additional $27 million in Series C financing. New investor Viola Growth led the round and was joined by previous investors Sequoia Capital, Spark Capital, MissionOG, and Vintage. The funding will help Behalf rapidly scale growth with increased investment in sales, business development and marketing, support continued product innovation, and bolster its position as a service leader in small business purchase financing. 


Business-to-business sales in the US total trillions of dollars annually. Unlike consumer sales, the majority of these are payments made by COD, Check, or ACH. The low penetration of credit-based transactions and limited access to working capital significantly constrains business purchasing in the small business segment and inhibits economic growth. Behalf solves for this friction between business suppliers and purchasers by offering instant credit approvals at the point of sale, with funds immediately released to settle the transaction. Behalf instantly advances payment to the supplier, then collects the funds from the purchaser’s bank account on a schedule they set. This affordable, on demand access to working capital helps suppliers and their customers do more business. 


Once approved, SMB customers can use their Behalf line to make purchases at virtually any of their suppliers. For every advance paid to a supplier by Behalf, the customer creates their ideal weekly, monthly, or one-time payment plan. Behalf’s innovative, fully customizable payment schedules give SMBs an unprecedented level of control over how they manage cash flow, with the ability to pay for their business purchases over time, extending up to six months.  


The company has doubled revenues every six months since inception.


Harel Beit-On, Viola Growth Founder and General Partner, will join the Behalf Board. Beit-On joins Shmil Levy, Managing Partner of Sequoia Capital; Gene Lockhart, Managing Partner of Mission OG and former CEO of MasterCard; Santo Politi, Founder and General Partner of Spark Capital; Phillip Riese, former President of American Express Consumer Card; and Benjy Feinberg, Co-Founder and CEO of Behalf.


“Behalf is targeting a fast growing market of SMB payments and credit, valued by analysts in the trillions, that is underserved by banks” said Harel Beit-On. “Led by a strong founding and executive team, Behalf presents an impressive growth rate and high customer retention, by disrupting the way small businesses purchase new goods and services from their vendors of choice with clear affordable terms. We are happy to partner with the Behalf team as they embark on the next phase of growth.” 


In readying the company to scale, Behalf has strengthened its executive team with a mix of payments industry veterans and proven growth phase operators. Jorgen Bocklage, Founder of 118 118 Money in the UK and former VP of Finance at Dashlane, has been appointed Behalf’s CFO. 


Brian Kleinberg, a former EVP at American Express who has recently been advising early stage Fintech and e-commerce companies, has joined to lead Strategy. Crystal Eastman, another former American Express Executive who has held positions in the Card area and within the Enterprise Growth Group, signed on as Head of Marketing. Yaniv Shaya, who has held numerous technology leadership roles at HP; Mercury Interactive; and was most recently SVP of Engineering at Imperva, has also joined to lead Engineering and Risk. In the coming 12 months Behalf will be hiring for roles across Sales, Marketing, Account Management, Customer Service, Product, and Engineering in both the New York and Tel Aviv offices.


“SMBs are the unsung heroes of the US economy, producing nearly half of the US’ goods and services, responsible for two out of every three new jobs created, and generating the majority of innovation in the process. Yet, they are severely constrained by lack of access to working capital and their financial needs are not a focus area for traditional banks,” said Benjy Feinberg, Co-founder and CEO of Behalf. “Behalf has a simple solution, driven by data and technology, that allows us to provide well-priced and flexible credit tools to help SMBs and their suppliers grow profitably. The addition of Viola’s leadership to our team and the growth this round will fund will both help us accelerate our mission.”

The Israeli company’s technology meets the growing need to help datacom manage all of the exponentially growing traffic.



http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-optical-communications-co-colorchip-raises-20m-1001146611



Israeli optical communications company ColorChip has raised $20 million from Gemini Israel Funds, BRM Group, IGP, Vintage, HGL Capital, and Viola Credit. Founded in 2001 by Dr. Shimon Eckhouse and Prof. Shlomo Rushin of Tel Aviv University School of Engineering, the Yokneam based company has raised $80 million to date including the latest financing round and its previous financing round of $25 million in November 2015. IGP, Gemini and BRM led previous financing rounds.



ColorChip is a privately held Israeli company that provides cost effective, dense, hyper-scale transceivers and advanced optical splitters. The funding will enable the Israeli company to ramp-up operations and accelerate product development.



With Internet services becoming more data intensive due to streaming HD video, virtual reality, cloud computing, and IoT devices, there is a growing need for new technologies to help datacom manage all of the exponentially growing traffic. ColorChip’s innovative optical communication solutions are well positioned to help solve the growing bandwidth demand of the web.



ColorChip CEO Yigal Ezra said, “We have so much support and confidence from our investors and are going to utilize the funds to recruit additional employees as well as scale up our operations to better serve the growing demands of the Datacom market.”



ColorChip has developed unique SystemOnGlass technology a hybrid optical integrated circuit. ColorChip uses glass wafers to industrialize its optical devices, allowing for cost effective, rapid, and highly scalable production. In essence, this allows the company to bring efficiencies commonly only seen in semiconductor fabrication to the world of optical communications.



ColorChip is also unique in the Israeli landscape, since it not only develops its solutions but is also vertically integrated and manufactures its core technology in its wholly owned and operated state of the art fab in Israel. The fab utilizes the company’s unique IP and is a critical component of its core technology, positioning the company as a leader in the industrialized manufacture of optical assemblies. The company is targeting the high speed transceiver 40G/100G Datacom market, predicted to reach $1.7 billion by 2019.



ColorChip is in the process of scaling up its operations, including hiring new employees in Israel, the US, and remote site facilities. The new funding will directly support these efforts.

                                            Providence Equity invests $96M in Skybox Security

SAN JOSE, CA–(Marketwired – February 03, 2016) – Skybox® Security, a global leader in security analytics, announced today the company has received a $96 million investment from Providence Strategic Growth (PSG), the growth equity affiliate of Providence Equity Partners, a global private equity firm with $45 billion in assets under management. Skybox is headquartered in Silicon Valley and develops powerful software solutions that extract insight from cybersecurity data to give unprecedented visibility of an enterprise’s attack surface, the ways in which its IT systems are vulnerable to threats.Despite billions of dollars spent annually on cybersecurity tools and services, the time required to resolve a cyberattack continues to increase. This is compounded by the increasing complexity of networks with thousands of potentially exploitable attack vectors, leaving security professionals struggling to discover areas of highest risk and prioritize mitigation and remediation actions. CISOs are also searching for ways to properly evaluate strategic options and convey the potential business impact of emerging threats to senior executives and the board.The Skybox Security Suite solves these problems by integrating with more than 90 networking and security tools in use by enterprises today. The Suite utilizes advanced analytics, such as modelling and simulation, to extract relevant and actionable intelligence from the silos of data created by those tools, giving security leaders the most comprehensive view of their attack surface and the insight needed to quickly make informed decisions about where to direct security resources.“Skybox is on the leading edge of a security segment that’s highly relevant right now, given the high-profile network security breaches that have occurred at numerous large enterprises,” said Thomas M. Reardon, managing director of PSG.According to recent analysis, IDC estimates that the security and vulnerability management market alone will reach $6.5 billion in 2018 and continue to grow at a rate exceeding 10 percent.“Skybox Security innovations in network visualization and intelligence are reshaping how large enterprises manage their security programs,” continued Reardon. “The company is also showing very strong business performance, with impressive top-line growth, profitability and incredibly high customer acquisition and retention rates.”In four years, Skybox has grown its acquisition rate of new customers by 220 percent and revenue by 221 percent. In 2015, the company increased year-over-year sales by 55 percent, fueled by a 59 percent increase in deals valued more than $100,000 and a 165 percent increase in deals valued more than $500,000.Skybox customers are Global 2000 companies and government agencies, in more than 50 countries and nearly every industry. The company’s products are used by six of the top 10 global banks, 10 global telecommunications firms, five of the world’s largest consumer goods manufacturers and 10 of the largest energy providers globally.With the investment, Mark Hastings and Thomas Reardon, managing directors with PSG, will join the Skybox board of directors.“This deal is a great validation of our strategic vision for the company, the success of our technology in the market and our ability to execute,” said Gidi Cohen, founder and CEO of Skybox Security. “We’ve been on an incredible upward trajectory, and the investment will accelerate that growth. I’ve no doubt, with the innovations we’re bringing to market this year and next, Skybox will become the undisputed leader in security analytics.”

NEW YORK,
October 22, 2015 – Worthy (www.worthy.com),
the premier online marketplace for pre-owned luxury goods, has raised $8
million in a Series B funding round led by Carmel Ventures (Carmel Ventures), a member of the Viola Group.As part of

innovation. Worthy, founded in 2012, previously raised over $8.5 million.Shlomo Dovrat, co-founder and general partner of Carmel Ventures said“We believe there is a significant
opportunity in ‘Re-commerce’ for privately owned high value jewelry. Consumers
who own high valued jewelry, diamonds, watches and other luxury valuables do
not have a fair and convenient alternative to sell them. As a true marketplace,
Worthy brings significant value not only to the sellers but also to its buyers,

business.”“U.S.
households constitute, in effect, the single biggest diamond mine in the world,
with over $1 trillion worth of polished diamonds. Any individual who owns a
diamond is a stakeholder of this mine. It is estimated that there are only 50
more years’ worth of new gem quality diamonds worthy of excavations. The future
of diamonds lays with recycling already-mined diamonds and repurposing them,” said Ben De-Kalo, founder
and CEO of Worthy. “We
provide businesses with direct and trusted access to the significant supply
households present, including unique pieces that add a luxury flavor to their
showcase.”Mr. De-Kalo

the trust by Carmel Ventures, a world class firm and are excited to be working
with Shlomo Dovrat to build a category leader.”Founded by Mr. De-Kalo, Worthy is the fastest

Series
A Funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Carmel Ventures Will Enable
enSilo’s Data-Exfiltration Prevention Approach to Expand in the US Market

[TEL AVIV,
ISRAEL – June 16th, 2015] – Cyber-security startup enSilo announced
today that it has raised $10 million in Series A financing. The round was led
by Lightspeed Venture Partners with additional investment from existing backer
Carmel Ventures. 
Founded in 2014,
enSilo emerged from stealth mode in March, 2015. The new investment will be
used to expand the company’s global operations, in particular in the North
America market, and to open US offices on the West Coast. 
Given the ever-increasing
scope and tenacity of targeted cyber-attacks on businesses, organizations and
governments, enSilo diverges from the widely-accepted notion that external
threat actors can be prevented from infiltrating networks. The company
instead assumes that organizations have already been compromisedand focuses
on preventing the exfiltration of critical data – precisely the most
critical and costly aspect of cyber-attacks. With enSilo’s offering against
targeted attacks, employees are still able to continue working, even when the system
is infected.
 “In the same way chronically-ill patients are
provided treatment to increase quality of life and longevity, organizations
must assume that they are working with a persistently compromised network and learn
how to maintain business-as-usual despite the contaminated environment,” said Roy
Katmor, CEO & co-founder of enSilo. “Time and time again organizations’
networks are infiltrated. We seek to shift the model from trying to block
inbound threats to concretely stopping threat actors already on the inside from
inflicting damage and stealing valuable data.” 
When enSilo’s
solution detects a data exfiltration attempt, it sends a single alert to the
customer notifying them of the situation and blocks malicious outbound
communications. By generating only one alert per active threat, enSilo
eliminates the paralyzing scourge of alarms faced by information-security teams.

David
Gussarsky, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, who has joined enSilo’s
board of directors following the investment said, “We are excited to invest in
a company whose innovative solution gives corporations and organizations the
best of both worlds. First, the assurance that their data is fully protected
and second, the knowledge that even if a device becomes infected, the company
can continue working while the threat is resolved.”
Ronen Nir, a General
Partner at Carmel Ventures who led the Seed round and sits on enSilo’s board of
directors, added: “At Carmel Ventures, we are excited to continue our long term
partnership with the exceptionally talented founding team of enSilo that is
already helping businesses protect their assets with its innovative
data-exfiltration prevention solution. That shows just how eager the market is
for this new approach.”
enSilo’s
research team recently discovered a vulnerability in all versions of Windows – from
Windows XP to Windows 10 Technical Preview – which could be exploited by
malicious actors to bypass all the security measures in Windows by modifying
only a single bit. The security hole was reported and Microsoft released a
security patch in February 2015.

Pitney Bowes (NYSE: PBI) is acquiring Israeli e-commerce companyBorderfree Inc. (Nasdaq: BRDR) for $395 million.

                                            Avid Enters Into a Definitive Agreement to Acquire Orad



                                            12/04/2015

                                                Read more



Avid (Nasdaq: AVID) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Orad Hi-Tec Systems Ltd., a Frankfurt stock exchange-listed public company with its headquarters in Kfar Saba, Israel, for €5.67 per share in an all-cash transaction. Orad is a leading provider of state-of-the-art 3D real-time graphics, video servers and related asset management solutions. The acquisition is consistent with Avid’s stated growth strategy and Avid believes it will continue to deliver on the company’s Avid Everywhere vision, by adding key content creation and media management solutions to the Avid MediaCentral Platform, the industry's most open, innovative and comprehensive media platform.

Transaction Highlights


Avid expects that the combined company will further Avid’s position as the most comprehensive provider of content creation to distribution workflows for broadcast and media customers around the world.
Avid believes the addition of Orad’s products to the Avid platform will further enhance the value of the platform to Avid customers. 
Joining the larger Avid organization opens opportunities for Orad to gain operating efficiencies and to make the innovation investments most important to Orad customers.
Avid expects the transaction to be accretive on an Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow basis, and will be financed by a new $100 million senior subordinated credit facility.

“We have followed Orad’s success in the market for many years and are excited about the prospects of what our combined companies can accomplish,” said Louis Hernandez, Jr, Chairman, President, and CEO of Avid. “Our industry is in a period of significant transition, in which our customers are demanding a single platform to connect creation with collaboration, asset protection, distribution and monetization. We believe this transaction further differentiates Avid as the partner with the most comprehensive solution, and accelerates our momentum as we enable our customers to operate more efficiently and profitably.”
“Avid has a long-standing heritage of industry leadership, and it’s clear that both Avid and Orad have a common commitment to innovation and customer success,” said Avi Sharir, CEO and President of Orad. “Our solutions are highly complementary to the Avid product suite, and together we believe we can create the most comprehensive solution for the media industry. Further, Avid’s global scale and distribution network provide significant opportunities for customer support, growth and market expansion.  We are confident that joining the Avid family will create more powerful opportunities for our customers, partners, and employees.”

Transaction Overview

Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Avid has agreed to pay €5.67 in cash for each share of Orad common stock which, at today’s exchange rate equals approximately $60 million, net of estimated cash acquired. We believe this valuation represents an approximate 6x multiple of EBITDA, net of estimated cost synergies leveraging our platform thus generating attractive economics for us and a richer more efficient experience for our customers, said John Frederick, Avid’s Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative and Financial Officer.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by 75% of Orad’s shareholders and closing is expected to take place in June 2015. Avid has entered into voting agreements with holders of a majority of Orad’s outstanding shares of capital stock, pursuant to which they agree to vote in favor of the transaction. Avid intends to fund the purchase price with a $100 million secured term loan for which it has received a financing commitment.      













                                            Israeli founded mobile shopping platform Tapingo secures additional $22 million to transform local commerce



                                            02/04/2015

                                                Read more



Tapingo
today announced a $22 million investment led by Qualcomm Incorporated through
its investment arm Qualcomm Ventures. DCM Ventures, Kinzon Capital, and
existing investors Khosla Ventures and Carmel Ventures also participated in the
round. The company will use the funding to accelerate its expansion beyond the
college market, with the goal of transforming local commerce.
Tapingo
is led by founder/CEO Daniel Almog and CTO Udi Oster, who met in the IDF’s
intelligence unit. Its mobile-ordering technology is designed to make buying
things quicker and more convenient. Tapingo uses machine-learning technology to
determine user preferences from everyday behavior, then match those preferences
with what’s available nearby.
“When
you buy a coffee, you shouldn’t have to wait in line, pay at a register, then
wait again,” says Almog. “Your phone should know what kind of coffee you like
and make sure it’s available for you—where you need it, when you need it.”
After
Tapingo went viral at the College of Management in Rishon Le’tziyon, Almog and
Oster moved to the USA to tap into its large college market. Since then,
Tapingo has grown from two dozen campuses to more than 85 across the USA.
Tapingo currently processes more than 25,000 transactions per day, with the
average user transacting more than four times per week—making it larger than
any other on-demand ordering service.
“Our
vision was always to begin with dense retail ecosystems involving
high-frequency transactions. We realized that college campuses were the perfect
proving ground,” says Almog. “What we didn’t anticipate was how quickly
universities and students would adopt this new behavior. This validated our
decision to bring the technology to analogous ecosystems.”
Citing
the overwhelming popularity of Tapingo among its users, Almog notes that the
company has not only confidence in its product but an extremely loyal, growing
user base to serve as a foundation for pursuing new verticals. Earlier this
year, the company expanded into several new services, including delivery and
general campus retail.
“The
key to winning the on-demand space is to become part of a consumer’s everyday
routine,” says Almog. “We’ve achieved this at an unprecedented scale in our key
markets. With this foundation, we’re ready to take the next leap.”
With
rapid scaling a priority, Tapingo will use the new round of funding to hire
aggressively as well as invest in product development, operations, and
marketing.
"Tapingo
has used a mobile-first approach to create a win-win for consumers and merchants,"
says Mony Hassid, Senior Director of Qualcomm Ventures. "We believe that
they are uniquely positioned to win the large and growing local-commerce
market."
Tapingo
helps busy people get what they need—where they need it and when they need it.
Tapingo's
native mobile apps combine a rich, intuitive browsing platform with local
merchant partnerships. This lets you buy things around you instantly and
hassle-free. The product learns your preferences and eliminates stress and
wasted time.
Tapingo
offers merchant partners simple infrastructure for order processing. It helps
merchants gain new customers, grow loyalty and usage among existing customers,
and cut costs.
Tapingo
received a Series A investment led by Carmel Ventures and a Series B investment
led by Khosla Ventures prior to the current funding round.

Store or Google Play Store.

that is ripe for disruption. This is Viola PE's first investment out of our second
fund and the first investment in the eCommerce market, an area that we are
following carefully. We are excited to lead the round, and support GlassesUSA’s
founding team in their goal of making GlassesUSA the market leader in this fast-growing
multibillion dollar space."

not undergone a major change in decades. Like in many other retail industries in

is being disrupted in a similar way. Through an advanced online sales platform,
efficient supply and distribution, high quality products with competitive
prices and top-quality customer service, GlassesUSA will play a major role in
shaping the growing online optical industry. Glasses will no longer be an

other accessory. “

continue to expand our global market share and focus on customers satisfaction.

                                            Zend Announces the Future of PHP Frameworks: Zend Framework 3


                                        New Next-Generation PHP-based Application Framework for Web and Mobile Applications Unveiled
                                    


                                            12/03/2015

                                                Read more


CUPERTINO, Calif., March 12, 2015 -- Zend, the PHP Company, today announced the roadmap for Zend Framework 3, the next-generation PHP-based application framework for web and mobile applications. Zend Framework is the leading enterprise-grade web application framework used by a broad set of companies.  It is licensed under a commercial-friendly New BSD open-source license and has enjoyed contributions from the likes of IBM, Google and Microsoft in addition to strong Zend and community leadership over the years. "Using Zend Framework 2, we have been able to speed up the creation and maintenance of some of our best web PHP applications," said Gregory Besson, CEO AdFab Connect.  "We relied on its robustness and its component-oriented architecture to deliver the international website of DS, the new brand of PSA Peugeot Citroën. We are eager to try and adopt Zend Framework 3, which will bring the interoperability between PHP frameworks to the next level with PSR-7 and will highly improve performance with the early adoption of PHP7, to come end of this year." "Our development team relies on Zend Framework to deliver practical, rock solid web applications to startups and NYSE companies," said Baptiste Manson, CEO Inovia Team Inc. "Zend Framework 3 is forward-thinking, astonishing and, in short, it reinvents the framework." Zend Framework 3 offers a new design that takes full advantage of the PHP language evolution, new emerging technologies and techniques. With web and mobile development constantly changing, an effective framework must evolve and adapt to align with new platforms and technologies.  The new Zend Framework 3 is focused on simplicity, reusability and performance. It will offer a “use-at-will” architecture by delivering components for independent consumption by developers. The new framework design will make it easier for beginners to become proficient with the technology while still providing enterprise-grade features for more advanced developers. Zend Framework 3 Highlights and Capabilities: Separate components divided into individual and versioned projects for broader reuse and higher velocity of innovation (“use-at-will” architecture)Strong emphasis on HTTP messages, leveraging the PSR-7 specificationA new modern middleware-based runtime as a lighter weight, high-performance alternative to enterprise MVC frameworksApigility, Zend’s API Builder, will be delivered on top of the new middleware stack for better performance and simplicity, with the same streamlined, powerful user experienceOptimization for PHP 7, while still supporting PHP 5.5 and up “The PHP ecosystem is undergoing a ‘renaissance’ with a multitude of development processes, new technologies and coding practice changes in the last few years,” said Matthew Weier O'Phinney, Zend Framework Team Lead at Zend Technologies.  “The latest Zend Framework will change how developers work with PHP, providing them with a ‘use-at-will’ architecture option as well as a framework that aligns with ever-changing platforms and technologies. This ensures developers have the specific components they need to create the next-generation of high-performance PHP-based web and mobile applications for the enterprise.” Users of previous Zend Framework versions will have a documented upgrade path to Zend Framework 3 that requires minimal changes. Zend Framework 3 will be available in Q3 2015.  For additional information about Zend Framework, please check out the Zend Framework Website. Additional Testimonials and References: "We have been using Zend Framework 2 since the first week it launched. The framework’s flexibility and robustness as well as Zend’s credibility provide great value and confidence to our clients. We are very excited about Zend Framework 3, mostly because of PSR-7 compatibility and middleware patterns." - Elton Minetto, CEO, Coderockr “From day one, Zend Framework inherits Zend’s vision to provide the most advanced tools to build critical applications that make today’s PHP the most efficient and reliable technology to address new digital challenges. In changing the scope and concept of the PHP Framework itself, Zend Framework 3 demonstrates once again that leadership. ZF3 brings greater operability, simplicity and exciting performance improvement in removing PHP frameworks’ structural barriers. In combination with PSR-7, Zend Framework 3 also opens a new perspective of components reusability across frameworks, which is another step ahead for all decision makers who want to deliver high performing and secure applications at lower costs.” - Christian Durel, CEO & Co-Founder, Melis Technology "We develop enterprise-grade and highly secured PHP applications for our clients. We selected Zend Framework for its enterprise readiness, flexibility and performance, which allow us to build robust, reliable and secure applications for our clients. We are looking forward to the next generation PHP framework with Zend Framework 3, especially its modularity, support for PSR-7 and the high performing PHP7. " -  Cyrille Grandval, CEO, Darkmira “Web engineering and e-business specialization aim to answer a growing demand of profiles with dual competences: developing projects and adding value. It is important for us during this two-year course to propose a curriculum with a mix of business and technology. With that purpose, learning a framework is indispensable. The school has naturally selected Zend Framework for its maturity, and its leading market position in the enterprise.  We are looking forward to the new flexibility offered by the component model of Zend Framework 3 as well as its middleware approach.” - Cédric Descoutures, Educational Manager, Web Development and e-Business, ESGI About Zend Framework Zend Framework provides a template with the most common business and enterprise application features, helping developers quickly create robust applications. Developers can work smarter and faster by leveraging this set of existing features without having to reinvent the wheel each time they create a new application.  Today, Zend Framework is used in some of the most popular PHP applications such as Magento, the market leading ecommerce application.

                                            Israeli Cybersecurity Start Up enSilo Emerges from Stealth Mode to Tackle Exfiltration Prevention

enSilo Launches into Global Security Arena with a Unique Perspective on the Cyber Kill Chain
Today, enSilo, a data exfiltration prevention vendor, launches into the international cybersecurity market with a real-time data exfiltration prevention platform to address the evolving nature of the cyber kill chain. enSilo, founded in 2014, raised its Seed funding from Carmel Ventures, a leading Israeli VC firm and member of the Viola Group.
Given the constant and chronic nature of today's cyber-attacks, enSilo reverses the traditional perspective on threats by looking at the end of the kill chain, where exfiltration occurs, rather than the beginning. enSilo's application agnostic platform analyzes communication requests at the operating system (OS) level to enforce the anti-exfiltration policies already on connection establishment requests. The company's solution enables organizations from all verticals to prevent business critical data from being stolen from the organization by advanced attackers even in the face of the persistent, chronic, advanced attacks. With its virtual patching against targeted attacks, enSilo enables employees to continue working, even with the endpoint is infected.
As a seasoned security professional, CEO of enSilo, Roy Katmor, is known for his ability to combine strong technical knowledge with proven sales and marketing capabilities. Prior to enSilo, Katmor led Akamai's security strategy as the company's Sr. Director, Security Product Strategy, where he focused on positioning Akamai as a security innovator during a transitional time for the company. In addition, Katmor managed Imperva's data security technical product management and architecture.
"The traditional defense-in-depth approach against advanced targeted threats has resulted in too many alerts for security professionals to handle. The constant infiltration nature of today's threats led organizations into a "Whack-a-Mole" state where they are pre-destined to lose the game," said Roy Katmor, CEO of enSilo. "By reversing the cyber kill chain defense model, enSilo is able to prevent - in real time - only active exfiltration attempts by targeted attackers. Thus, enSilo generates only one alert per one active threat while allowing organizations to continue operating as usual."
"Organizations today are under constant and chronic attack at some level. All are faced with the real threat of their most valued resources being stolen through one or more of a variety of sophisticated methods. Defending against data exfiltration is at the core of security prevention and should be considered for any environment to mitigate these threats while maintaining "business as usual" operations," said David Monahan, EMA.
Ronen Nir, General Partner at Carmel Ventures who joined the Company's board of directors added: "We at Carmel Ventures, are excited to partner with the exceptional founding team of enSilo that brings a unique approach to the growing Advanced Persistent Attack problem."

About enSilo
enSilo offers a real-time exfiltration prevention platform. The company was founded on the recognition that targeted attacks are similar to chronic diseases where organizations that have made responsible and sustained investments in attack detection continue to be compromised. In the same way chronically-ill patients are treated to control the disease and increase longevity, organizations must deal in real-time with a persistently compromised network.  To that effect, enSilo prevents the consequences of an advanced targeted attack, namely, the theft of valuable data. enSilo has developed a platform which accurately distinguishes legitimate connections from malicious ones, already on initial connection establishment. Our solution provides virtual patching against advanced targeted threats enabling employees to keep working as usual while a device compromise is resolved.
The company is headed by highly respected security veterans from leading private and public sector companies, including Imperva, Akamai, EMC and Rafael. enSilo is financially-backed by Carmel Ventures.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) is buying N-trig, an Israeli provider of digital pens and chips for touch screens, for at least $200 million, the Calcalist financial news website said on Thursday.



Most of N-trig's 190 workers will be integrated into Microsoft Israel and will be part of a new research and development center, Calcalist said, without citing sources.



Officials at N-trig and Microsoft in Israel could not be reached for comment.



N-trig was valued at $75 million when it raised money privately last February.



N-trig had revenue of $36.7 million in 2013, up 38 percent from 2012. Revenue totaled $20.6 million in the first half of 2014, when it sold 1.3 million digital pens, more than three times the amount it sold in the same period of 2013.



Microsoft, which owns 6.1 percent of the company, signed a deal last year to integrate N-trig' s pen in its Surface Pro 3 tablets. Other investors in the company include Evergreen Venture Partners, Canaan Partners and Tamares.



Customers for N-trig's technology include Sony (6758.T), Fujitsu (6702.T), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and Lenovo (0992.HK) for use in smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks.

“This acquisition of Red Bend, a true pioneer in OTA and virtualization       technologies for cyber security, adds a critical component to our       automotive systems and services portfolio that will essentially future       proof software in cars, ultimately making them safer, smarter and more       efficient,” said Dinesh C. Paliwal, Chairman, President, and CEO of       HARMAN. “Together with our Symphony Teleca acquisition, HARMAN now has       the essential foundation and deep bench strength for a comprehensive       systems and services portfolio. Today marks a huge transformation for       HARMAN and further advancement towards delivering consumers a seamless,       connected car and connected lifestyle experience.”     
      “With over 15 years of success in delivering world-class over-the-air       update solutions to the telecom and mobile markets, we are pleased to       bring our proven track record to HARMAN,” said Yoram Salinger, President       and CEO of Red Bend. “By joining forces with HARMAN, we will accelerate       our growth in expanding markets such as the connected car while also       continuing to support billions of mobile devices. Beyond mobile, Red       Bend and HARMAN will implement OTA software management to enhance       infotainment and embedded system performance as well as other in-car       ECU-based systems. These solutions will benefit the entire automotive       ecosystem through cost savings, increased security and a seamless       customer experience.”     
Red Bend’s software management solutions and hypervisor-based       virtualization technologies for cyber security are already widely       adopted in mobile devices and ideally suited to meet the rising demands       of the connected car. By 2020, it is expected that more than 90 percent       of vehicles on the road will be connected (Frost and Sullivan).       Importantly, Red Bend solutions also serve as critical prerequisites for       autonomous driving. By bringing Red Bend under the HARMAN umbrella and       driving broad industry usage, HARMAN’s combined technology portfolio       will seamlessly enable safe, secure OTA updates for a variety of       on-board Harman and non-Harman automotive systems – whether embedded or       downloaded -- speeding the pace of innovation to automakers and the       industry.     
      The Red Bend acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and       customary closing adjustments. It is expected to close in third quarter       of HARMAN’s 2015 fiscal year.     
      Upon close of the transaction, Red Bend will operate within HARMAN as an       independent unit led by its existing management team, while benefiting       from HARMAN’s scale, resources, and deep automotive domain experience.

Viola Group, Israel’s premier technology oriented private
equity investment group with over $2 billion under management, has just
launched its brand new content site Viola
Notes (www.viola-notes.com). The new blog will tap into the vast
knowledge-pool of Viola’s investment professionals in an effort to boost
transparency and generate discussions that can help empower tech companies for
growth. 
 Viola Group is
comprised of four independent funds including: Carmel Ventures – a top tier
Venture Capital fund; Viola Credit – a leading equity-based lending fund; Viola
Private Equity – a technology focused growth capital and buyout fund.
  “Our team here at Viola includes highly experienced
individuals who have been in the business of growing businesses for many years and
we want to share our collective experience with the wider tech community”, said
Daniel Cohen, General Partner at Carmel Ventures. “Also, we feel that there’s
room in the Israeli blogosphere for more forums that deal with subjects
uniquely relevant to the Israeli tech industry and we’re excited to offer Viola
Notes as a platform to share insights and generate discussions.”
 “We often share our experiences and best practices with
members of our portfolio companies and our close network, but it’s occurred to
us that we lack a forum to share these insights with other members of the
broader tech community,” said Hila Shitrit Nissim, Marketing Director at Viola
Group. “Launching a blog feels like an obvious step for us, especially
given the value of original, high-quality content these days.”
 Viola Notes is aimed at entrepreneurs and business people
both in Israel and abroad and will offer insights on trends and topics relating
to startups, business growth, investment and more, as well as practical ‘how
to’ style posts.
 Viola Group’s team members will be the main contributors to
the blog, but it will also feature an exciting lineup of guest bloggers from
among Viola’s over 100 portfolio companies as well as hand-picked industry
experts from around the world.
 Viola Notes is managed by Noya Lizor, Viola
Group’s newly appointed Director of Content who was brought in specifically
to focus on the group’s content marketing activities, which is a first in the
local VC landscape. Originally from Israel, Noya spent over 20 years in
Australia where she worked in a variety of creative and editorial roles both in
publishing and advertising. Her last role before returning to Israel was at
McCann Worldgroup (Sydney) and since returning to Israel 6 years ago she has worked
in Israel’s vibrant startup scene in several senior marketing roles.
  “Viola Group is all about empowering tech companies for
growth. My vision for this blog is to present highly interesting, useful and
hopefully inspirational content, some of which will come from the highly
experienced folks at Viola and some from members of the tech community itself
whose expertise I feel is particularly relevant to our audience” said Ms.
Lizor.  “There’s lots of terrific content
in the pipeline for 2015 and we’re looking forward to sharing it with Viola Notes
subscribers and followers”.

NEW PATENT RECOGNIZES CLARIZEN’S APPROACH FOR USING EMAIL TO TRIGGER WORKFLOWS, PROJECTS AND MORE

SAN MATEO, Calif. – January 8, 2015 – 
Clarizen, the leader in enterprise work collaboration software, today announced that it has been awarded a patent for its innovations in the collaborative workplace.  The newly patented technology enables automation on any project-related workflows through email – the world’s most-used productivity tool.Clarizen’s Vice President of Product Rachel Haim Hadas and Chief Architect Eyal Post authored US Patent 8856246B2 for a System and Method for Project Management Using Electronic Messaging. The patent relates to Clarizen’s InterAct™ email engine, an innovative tool that allows users to trigger specific project-related actions through their email, such as approval processes, generating reports, creating new projects and other workflows. Because email is connected to nearly every application, Clarizen’s technology can essentially integrate these systems as well.“This patent is an important technical milestone for Clarizen, one that has been in the making for several years,” said Avinoam Nowogrodski, founder and CEO, Clarizen. “It underscores the significant investment we have made in continuous innovation to stay one step ahead of customer and market needs. The value the technology delivers is a strategic win for Clarizen’s customers, and we look forward to sharing more patented innovations with them in the future.”The patent recognizes the uniqueness of the underlying technology of Clarizen’s cloud-based enterprise-class work collaboration and project management solution. Clarizen’s “make your own rules” capability is unique within the enterprise work collaboration market, making content configurable and empowering users to control how an email is converted into action.Clarizen’s patented electronic messaging technology allows users to build and customize their email rules and routing system via Clarizen InterAct.Clarizen customers can:


Generate an unlimited number of email addresses and associated actions, business and routing rules


Send an email via Clarizen requesting an updated report and quickly receive a reply with the report attached


Submit an issue to InterAct via email or a form, prompting the issue to be automatically added to the appropriate project with a notification sent to the project manager


“Email is still by far the most used collaboration tool, but email was not really built to support collaboration (many-to-many). What Clarizen has done with this patent is part of a trend we are seeing where team members are moving from email to more context-based in-app communications,” said David Coleman, senior research analyst at Gigaom Research and managing director of Collaborative Strategies, Inc. “Clarizen's patented technology bridges the gap between today’s reality and supporting a more efficient process by letting the emails themselves become drivers of tasks, issues or projects.”For more information about Clarizen InterAct, click here.

The Work Graph  The way most companies work is broken. First we build work groups, and then we engage in conversations, which may become actions and, ideally, these actions become deliverables.  Each of these typically live in disconnected “islands" of activity, managed by different systems.  Clarizen is different in that it connects these islands into a “work graph” that is organically created through the act of getting work done. The work graph enables collaboration that drives results, turning every organization into a high-performance operation.

About Clarizen
Clarizen is the leader in enterprise-class work collaboration and project management solutions that harness the power of the cloud to get work done efficiently, effectively and with better results. Fast to deploy and easy to use, Clarizen is redefining enterprise collaboration by connecting social context with tasks and projects to drive increased productivity and profitability. Clarizen fuels the high-performance teams of more than 2,300 organizations across 76 countries, including dozens of the Fortune 500. Most recently, Gigaom Research rated Clarizen at the top in its Sector RoadMap: process-based collaboration in 2014 report. Founded in 2006, Clarizen is privately held with offices in San Mateo, California and Hod Hasharon, Israel. For more information, visit www.clarizen.com.

As dozens vie for a share of this growing market, ECI telecom emerges as a leader in Edge/Aggregation Network Solutions​​​



​PETACH TIKVAH, ISRAEL  – DECEMBER 18, 2014

ECI Telecom ,a global provider of next-generation network solutions, has been named by HEAVY READING as one of the Top 5 P-OTS solutions for Edge/Aggregation Networks. ECI placed in the Top 5 over dozens of other industry leading competitors based on a list of criteria including breadth of portfolio, range of functionality and uniqueness of approach.
"Aggregation and edge transport networks are undergoing a wave of innovation that is far bigger, and far more disruptive, than has been seen for years," says Simon Sherrington, contributing analyst with Heavy Reading Insider and author of the report. "Changes to networks are not just focused on cost and density, but reflect the near total change in services running over the top of them that has been witnessed in the past 10 to 15 years." (Heavy Reading, 20141)
The HEAVY READING report stresses that as dozens of players are vying for a share of this growing market, advances in optical technology are driving platform change and scale in aggregation/edge platforms. SDN is transforming how these transport solutions will be managed. ECI Telecom's Apollo and NPT converged transport platforms provide end-to-end packet optical transport for Layer 0 through Layer 3 services coverage. The solutions extend seamlessly from the metro access to the regional core and long haul. Recently, ECI announced the release of SmartLight, its framework for deploying software defined networks (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV). By supporting "smart migration", SmartLight's open standard approach enables service providers to start enjoying the benefits of SDN immediately on their current installed base.
"We are thrilled that ECI Telecom has received the highest scores for breadth of our portfolio and range of functionality," states Jimmy Mizrachi, GM of Portfolio Business at ECI Telecom. "The industry is well aware that ECI was an early proponent of packet optical convergence and, as a result, one of the first to bring OTN to the metro level. We scored high on the uniqueness of our approach; due in part to the modular architecture of our offering which enables our clients to tailor a solution that meets their current needs while future proofing their system for tomorrow."
The high score was based primarily on the fact that ECI has developed, and still supports, three different series of packet-optical transport platforms which can be used as individual solutions or combined into one unified solution. In addition, all of ECI's platforms support Ethernet synchronization. The Apollo and NPT platforms support OTN, 100GE and 100 Gbit/s wavelength options. This range of functionality coupled with its CE2.0 certification, SDN readiness and LightApps SDN application suite scored the maximum points with the HEAVY READING judges.

Forbes, October 29, 2014:There may be no other industry outside television whose start-ups have so fully earned the description of “disruptive.” Whether it’s companies manufacturing high-definition antennas, streaming video-on-demand, offering OTT content, or capturing channels over the air and retransmitting them innovatively, TV is changing at lightning speed. Some of the new developments have resulted in litigation, notably the case of Aereo, a company that captured and retransmitted broadcast and cable channels and was effectively shut down by a Supreme Court decision earlier this year. But, despite that win for the traditional media players, other startups are pushing forward innovative solutions that are completely disrupting the industry. Here are 10 companies changing the TV industry: RR Media-Founded in 1981, NASDAQ listed RR Media (formerly RRsat) has been in the game quite a bit longer than other TV innovators, but it has managed to stay at the cutting edge of developments in the industry. The company distributes programming – mostly sports, events and news– to 95 percent of the world’s population through the global network it has built using satellite, fiber and Internet delivery. RR Media recently expanded its offerings to a full suite of media services – including channel management, content preparation and global distribution. Hundreds of broadcasters and content creators, including major sports leagues and news channels, rely on this company to handle the complex functions that today’s content delivery requires so they can focus on what’s most important: great content.Read more : http://www.forbes.com/sites/shamahyder/2014/10/29/10-companies-changing-the-tv-industry/2/

Publicis (PUBP.PA) has agreed to buy 20 percent of Israel-based digital advertising company Matomy Media Group MTMY.L for 227 pence per share, and has an option to purchase another 4.9 percent. 
Matomy's shares closed at 238 pence on Friday, valuing Publicis' 20 percent stake at around 42.6 million pounds. As major companies shift more of their spending to online marketing, advertising agencies like Publicis and its larger rivals WPP (WPP.L) and Omnicom (OMC.N) have been snapping up start-ups to gain technological know-how. The deal also shows how Publicis is seeking to boost growth after the failure in May of its mega-merger with Omnicom (OMC.N) hurt second-quarter performance.Matomy, which counts American Express and HSBC among its clients, specializes in so-called performance-based advertising that allows big companies to track the effectiveness of their online marketing. It only earns a fee from advertisers when it achieves certain pre-defined measurable results, such as sales or mobile app installations.Matomy made its stock market debut on the London Stock Exchange in July, with a listing price of 227 pence per share. Its shares were 233.9 pence at 0743 GMT (08:43 a.m. BST), while shares of Publicis were down 0.8 percent at 51 euros.Matomy posted 117.34 million pounds in sales last year, and a net profit of 4.44 million pounds. In the first half of this year, sales grew 9.5 percent to $107.6 million (66.77 million pounds)."Matomy is fuelled by the innovators and technology experts of Israel and has quickly risen to the top of this important market by creating a world leading, state of the art platform," said Publicis Chief Executive Maurice Levy in a statement.French bank Rothschild advised Matomy's core shareholders on the sale. http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/13/uk-publicis-groupe-matomy-idUKKCN0I20AP20141013

Groundbreaking development for broadcasting live analysis and graphics Orad, leader in interactive broadcasting solutions, and MUV, provider of interactive solutions that you wear, have combined their expertise to provide an interactive device, which is worn on a presenter’s finger and which turns any surface into an interactive screen. Ideal in a studio environment, the presenter can stand anywhere and rotate, scale, move, drag, tap, hold, draw, highlight graphics on any surface. The combined solution will be presented at Orad’s booth (7.B27) at IBC2014. MUV’s tracking technology can identify where the presenter is pointing to, standing, which surfaces are relevant, how much pressure is applied, etc. The data from the MUV device, called Bird, is then transmitted to Orad’s Interact system, which presents the corresponding graphics on the surface. For example, the presenter can drag any image on any wall in the studio or emphasize a particular object in the video wall. “This ground-breaking solution opens the door for broadcasters who want to turn any surface into an interactive surface. Moreover, by having the sensors on the presenter’s finger, he or she can stand anywhere in the studio as opposed to standing in front of the interactive screen itself,” comments Avi Sharir, CEO and president of Orad. “We are confident that this unique solution will establish a new standard for broadcasters to present their content in a futuristic fashion, with minimum adaptations to their current studios. Once we enable the presenter to easily interact with holographic content floating around him, a new ecosystem of interactive content is expected to emerge,” adds Rami Parham, CEO and founder of MUV.About MUV: MUV is an Israeli-based startup company developing smart wearable solutions for 3D motion sensing and in-room mapping. From its headquarters in Herzliya, MUV is selling its products to the world-wide consumer market with the target of redefining the way people interact with their digital life. - See more at: http://www.orad.tv/orad-and-muv-bring-interactive-capabilities-to-any-surface#sthash.7uIP29di.dpuf

We significantly advanced the DFU trial, a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for CureXcell. We continued to see high patient recruitment rates and remain on track to meet our previously disclosed milestone to complete patient enrollment in the second half of 2014. Additionally, we commenced a VLU trial, also a pivotal Phase III clinical trial, for the treatment of hard-to-heal VLUs, and randomized the first patient in May 2014," stated Nissim Mashiach, President and Chief Executive Officer of Macrocure. "With the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, we are well-positioned to fund our clinical and regulatory activities in order to seek regulatory approvals for a broad indication for the treatment of DFU and VLU in all types of chronic wounds below the knee, and build our manufacturing operations. We look forward to reporting further progress this year and remain committed to enhancing shareholder value as a publicly-traded company."

SAN MATEO, Calif. – May 21, 2014 – Clarizen, the leader in enterprise work collaboration software, today announced that it has closed a $35 million venture funding round led by Goldman Sachs & Co.

Clarizen’s opportunity is across verticals, across geographies, across functional departments, and across customer segments,” stated Michael Huang, Senior Research Analyst - SaaS/Application Software, in a recent Needham and Company report.



Clarizen has transformed work collaboration with its award-winning product for the enterprise and mid-market, Clarizen v6. This new investment will allow Clarizen to build on its market-leading v6 platform, keeping one step ahead of the product innovation curve. 



Clarizen continues to add an array of product and company-related awards and distinctions to its roster.  Key 2014 highlights include:
•Ranking in the “Champion” quadrant of Info-Tech Research Group‘s 2014 Mid-Market Project and Portfolio (PPM) Vendor Landscape report. Clarizen also won the report’s “Trend Setter Award” presented to “only those solutions that are deemed to include the most original/inventive product/service, or the most original/inventive feature/capability of a product/service.”
•Winning Business Intelligence Group’s 2014 “BIG Innovation Award,” presented to organizations/people that bring new ideas to life and change the way we experience the world, for Clarizen v6. 
•Ranking in the 2014 KMWorld list of “100 Companies that Matter in Knowledge Management.” The list is compiled during a year-long collaborative effort among colleagues, analysts, system integrators and a select group of users and highlights companies that best fulfill the goal of delivering the right information to the right people at the right time.

                                            Zend Announces Enhanced Long-Term Support Policy for PHP



New Zend Server 6.3, Zend Studio 10.6 Announced, Along With Extended Support for PHP 5.3 and Beyond

Zend, the PHP Company

, is enhancing its official Long-Term Support (LTS) policy for PHP, enabling users to confidently continue using a given major version of PHP – for instance, PHP 5.3 – for more than five years after its initial release date. This adds an additional 2 years (40%) to the life cycle of a major PHP version, after its end of support from the open source PHP community. This extended support for the PHP runtime is available for Zend Server customers via a Long-Term Support release of Zend Server that includes support and security hotfixes both for Zend Server and the PHP runtime included in it. 
By extending PHP version support for a period exceeding five years, Zend enables users to secure long-term value from their mission-critical production environments. According to Ido Benmoshe, Zend’s VP of Global Services: “Migrating stable production applications to newer PHP versions is often challenging for IT organizations due to cost, time investment, and a desire not to impact the stability of a working application. This has created a support gap as many business apps stay in usage beyond the open source community’s end of life for a given PHP version.”“As PHP becomes ever more widely used for mission critical purposes, more and more enterprises are faced with the challenges of maintaining a secure and compliant application environment while minimizing disruptive migrations,” said Zend CEO & Co-founder Andi Gutmans. “Zend Server is now liberating IT departments from that difficult choice, and providing them the flexibility to use the power of PHP on their own terms.”To view the full PHP Long Term Support policy, visit www.zend.com/php-long-term-support. The New Zend Server 6.3This upcoming new release of Zend Server, available later this month, will support production environments on three major versions of PHP: 5.5 (supported for the first time), 5.4, and 5.3. Zend Server 6.3 will provide Long Term Support for PHP 5.3, fully supporting that runtime version for three more years, until February 2017.Zend Server 6.3 is a platform designed to enable the Continuous Delivery of applications. Throughout every phase of the application delivery cycle, Zend Server enables continuous integration, release and infrastructure automation, and application management. In this release, Zend Server will be adding the following new capabilities:Expanded version support: Zend Server will now support PHP 5.5, and will be certified to run on Ubuntu 13.10 using Apache 2.4. New options for Windows PHP developers coding for the IBM i platform: the XML Toolkit that allows IBM i resources to be leveraged by PHP apps will now be easily deployable on Window-based Zend Server development systems. This expands the innovation potential of IBM i organizations by making Windows developers more productive, allowing them to locally build apps meant to run on production IBM i systems.Faster getting up to speed with popular PHP packaged applications: Zend Server 6.3 will include several sample apps ready for deployment. This lets users painlessly try out popular apps such as Drupal, Magento, WordPress and others. Zend Server immediately configures those apps to run on PHP, streamlining the process of testing out new apps and removing the time-consuming PHP installation and setup process for each app.

                                            Adapteva raises $3.6M for the ‘most energy efficient’ parallel computing chips

Parallel processing chip design firm Adapteva has raised $3.6 million in a round of funding from Carmel Ventures and telecommunications firm Ericsson.The Lexington, Mass.-based company will use the money to complete prototypes for its chips that it touts as energy-efficient parallel computing chips. The deal is a big endorsement for Adapteva’s technology, which can be used to provide energy-efficient parallel processing in telecommunications basestations — such as those made by Ericsson — and a variety of other supercomputing devices.The funding comes on the heels of the company’s success in the fall of 2012 when it raised almost $900,000 on Kickstarter to build a $99 Parallella supercomputer for everyone. That campaign was part of the company’s effort to build community support around its hardware among hobbyists and other hardware enthusiasts.Adapteva was founded in 2008 to develop a brand new architecture with a focus on energy-efficient chips. It designed a 16-core parallel processing accelerator and a 64-core chip in 2011. Now it is trying to bring those Epiphany chips, which can operate on 2 watts of power, to manufacturing. The processors can deliver about five gigaflops of performance per watt.AdaptevaAndreas Olofsson of AdaptevaMost chip projects costs huge amounts of money and use lots of engineers. But Adapteva has made it this far with just five people. The new funding will keep the dream of building a new chip architecture alive.“We’ve been waiting for our moment to come and I think we are almost there,” Andreas Olofsson, chief executive and founder of Adapteva, in an interview with VentureBeat. “We’ve been running on a very low capital structure for six years now. Selling a new processor architecture is almost impossible. But we have one of the most efficient chips in the world.”Olofsson said that Adapteva’s parallel processors — which have many brains, or cores, working at once — offer a 25 times edge in computing efficiency when compared to older approaches.“The potential for major returns in energy efficiency and performance gained from parallel processing are clear, and in fact critical, to support rapid growth in the telecoms industry. This makes innovations such as Adapteva’s very exciting for Ericsson and for the customers we work with,” said Sebastian Tolstoy, Ericsson vice president of business development.To try to bring Adapteva’s chips to a wider market, Adapteva launched Parallella, a tiny supercomputer, in 2012. The Kickstarter campaign raised money to develop a $99 circuit board for Kickstarter donors. In doing that, Adapteva followed in the footsteps of fan-hyped hardware companies like Rasberry Pi, the credit-card sized computer that can play games like Quake.It hasn’t delivered the boards to its 6,300 Kickstarter backers yet, but Olofsson said the company would do so now that it has more money. Shipments are targeted to be completed by the end of the first quarter.Open source community members are contributing software for Adapteva. Olofsson said the company can chain multiple Epiphany chips together for a total of 4,096 cores in a system. That could be useful in scientific computing, telecommunications, and embedded vision.“We’re going to be the most open chip company around,” Olofsson said.Adapteva will compete with rivals such as Tilera, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, ARM, and Intel. So far, 8,500 systems have been preordered. Olofsson said 140 universities are collaborating with Adapteva to educate students on parallel computing, and there’s a fairly large scientific computing customer waiting in the wings. Olofsson has more than 20 patents issued or pending. He’s a former chip designer for Analog Devices.“Parallel processing and high performance computing (HPC) are of huge interest to us as these markets are developing quickly and changing dramatically,” said Ori Bendori, partner at Carmel Ventures. “Adapteva’s approach is very different than the traditional silicon vendor model and we believe this could lead an industry transformation – just the type of innovation we like to invest in.”

Tel Aviv and New York (January 7, 2014) — Global performance marketing company Matomy Media Group (“Matomy”) today announced the completion of the integration of its U.S. subsidiary, MediaWhiz, into its global operations. As part of the corporate integration, the MediaWhiz brand has been retired, with the company now serving as Matomy’s U.S. hub of operations. Also being rebranded is MediaWhiz’s SEO service, which is now known as Matomy SEO.Matomy acquired MediaWhiz in January 2013.“Merging the MediaWhiz brand into Matomy will provide our advertisers and publishers with a robust, single gateway of global multichannel performance-advertising solutions, no matter where they are located in the world,” said Ofer Druker, CEO of Matomy Media Group. “This brand merger will ensure we provide increased simplicity, diversity and quality in the programs we manage for advertisers and publishers.

Overall in 2013, the company launched Mobit, its mobile media buying and tracking tool; acquired MobAff, a mobile affiliate network that it merged into its mobile business; and acquired Adquant’s social advertising agency (formerly known as Adotomi) to bring performance-based advertising solutions to Facebook.Matomy has nearly 385 employees worldwide, working from eight offices (Tel Aviv; New York; San Francisco; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Berlin; Madrid; Mexico City; and Denver).

It enables SAP users to replicate and move large volumes of data from and between SAP applications and data warehouses.  Hayes leverages deep data integration knowledge of SAP systems and offers proprietary technology innovations designed to enable organizations to maximize the flexibility, reliability and performance of selecting and replicating SAP data. With this acquisition, Attunity will further strengthen its position as one of the leading software vendors for Big Data replication, offering an even broader line of solutions that enable data access, sharing and distribution across heterogeneous IT platforms in enterprise data centers and Cloud environments.

It converges database and application platform capabilities in-memory to transform transactions, analytics, predictive and spatial processing so organizations can leverage business data in real-time. “Through the acquisition of Hayes, we will expand into the large SAP market as well as leverage synergies with our heterogeneous data replication, file transfer and Cloud technologies, supporting both enterprise data centers and the Cloud,” stated Shimon Alon, Chairman and CEO of Attunity. “In particular, this acquisition brings leading expertise and technology for SAP environments, strengthening our portfolio and solidifying our offerings across all major enterprise ecosystems. It will also enable us to cross-sell and up-sell our solutions to existing customers who leverage SAP software.” “Attunity offers us immediate access to a larger sales force and marketing team, as well as to their established partners in the Big Data and Cloud spaces,” stated Matthew Hayes, President, CTO and Founder of Hayes Technology Group. “Considering the advancements and growth that SAP’s HANA is experiencing in the market, we believe it is an optimal time for us to combine our offering with Attunity, a recognized leader in real-time data replication and loading technology. This is an exciting opportunity as it brings together complementary solutions and will allow us to offer a well-rounded suite of products to our Cloud and Big Data clients.  Sales and the quality support for Hayes customers will continue as usual.” Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Attunity acquired Hayes for approximately $6.2 million in a combination of cash and Attunity shares with an earnout potential of up to $4.2 million (in a combination of cash and Attunity shares) over the next two years.   Attunity expects Hayes to contribute approximately $4 million in revenues in 2014. Additional details regarding the transaction are included in the Report on Form 6-K that the Company will furnish today to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Roth Capital acted as exclusive financial advisor to Attunity on the transaction. About Attunity Attunity is a leading provider of information availability software solutions that enable access, sharing and distribution of data, including Big Data, across heterogeneous enterprise platforms, organizations, and the cloud.

ECI Telecom, a global provider of next-generation network solutions, announced today that its Native Packet Transport (NPT) platform has received a 2012 Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award from TMC and the editors of INTERNET TELEPHONY and CUSTOMER magazines.

HIGHLIGHTS:




The NPT, part of ECI’s Optimized Multi-Layer Transport architecture, addresses operators’ challenges when migration to or building new packet transport networks (PTN).  With multidimensional flexibility and unified multilayer management, the NPT platforms are optimized for the metro market to guarantee lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) for the network’s entire lifecycle.​
The NPT’s architecture translates into simple and efficient operatio​ns, with flexible handling of packet and TDM traffic, ranging from true and independent native switching alongside CES and EoS support.
Like all of ECI’s transport platforms, the NPT is managed by ECI’s LightSoft® network management system, for a unified multi-layer management system for MPLS, WDM and TDM. With GUI-based operation, operators’ packet transport networks are as easily managed as existing TDM-based transport networks, resulting in significant opex savings.
The Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award recognizes the vision, leadership, and thoroughness that are characteristics of the prestigious award. The most innovative products and services brought to the market from March 2012 through March 2013 were chosen as winners of the Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award. ​

Gaon Holdings has an extensive portfolio of companies in areas that Israel is a global leader. Together with the existing owners, we will work to enhance these companies’ activities in Israel and abroad”. Moshe Gaon, controlling shareholder until the entrance of Viola, and the son of the Company’s Founder, the late Benny Gaon said that he is sure that the new partners, people with ability and international connections and a belief in the potential of Gaon in the areas of water and clean-tech, will work to ensure the continued organic growth of the Company and its entry into new fields of activity. “In the current economic reality, an informed decision was made, for the good of the Company and to ensure its good name and reputation, to bring in a new partner through a substantial financial investment and relinquish control of the Company. All this was done to prevent damage to investors and with the aim of meeting all the Company’s commitments” stated Gaon. Chairman of the Board of Gaon Holdings, Erez Meltzer, today thanked the shareholders and workers of the Company. “In the prevailing public atmosphere, it seems to me that this case is most noteworthy. We have an example of shareholders behaving with great responsibility, and even being prepared to relinquish most of their holdings in a public company in order to ensure that the Company will be able to meet its financial commitments” said Meltzer. "Together with our new partners, Viola PE, I am convinced that the Company will be able to accelerate its growth, to expand investment in existing holdings, to acquire new holdings in the clean-tech field and to strengthen Gaon Holdings’ status as Israel’s largest clean-tech company”.Gaon Holdings finished the first quarter of this year with revenues of NIS297.1 million, compared to revenues of NIS308.3 million for the same quarter last year. This temporary decline in sales derived, mainly, from the decline in sales of the subsidiary company, Middle East Tubes, where the onset of winter caused the postponement of projects of a large customer in the infrastructure field. Discounting this temporary decline, the revenues of the Gaon Group grew by 15%.   The Company’s financial commitments to the banks and bond holders declined during the first quarter of the year from NIS488 million to NIS416 million, as part of the Company’s efforts to reduce its bank and other leveraging.

  Abe's Market, the online destination for discovering and experiencing the best natural and organic products, today announced the closing of $5 million in new financing led by Carmel Ventures. The round also includes contributions from current investors Index Ventures and Accel Partners, and new investors Beringea and OurCrowd.
  With twice the selection of Whole Foods in several key categories, Abe's Market has become an authority for helping people live a better, more conscientious lifestyle. In addition to its ample collection of food, baby, home, beauty, pet and fashion products, the site is constantly rolling out new, innovative features aimed at revolutionizing the natural living and online sectors.
  Just unveiled, for example, is a new feature called Abe's Qualities, a first of its kind system that allows shoppers to customize their shopping experience based on what's most important to their diet or lifestyle. Months of deep analytical work, combined with insight from merchants and thought-leaders in the space, allowed Abe's Market to determine how each of the 11,000+ products offered on the site fit into 220+ qualities, including USDA Certified Organic, BPA-free, Paleo diet friendly, locally-sourced, gluten-free, Certified Fair Trade, vegan, kosher, recycled and many more. Users can filter any item by these particular qualities to make quicker, more efficient buying decisions, and simultaneously learn about how they benefit their health and the planet. Abe's Qualities is unlike anything else in ecommerce, and is a step towards the goal of creating a more humanized online shopping experience.
  "Abe's Market stands for much more than just a business ... we represent a way of life," said Richard Demb, co-founder and CEO of Abe's Market. "By providing a personal connection with the merchant and their products online, we are improving the buying experience and helping consumers enjoy a healthier lifestyle. This new round of funding from leading investors is a testament to the strength of what we have built and the future ahead of us."
  Abe's Market is using the new funds to fuel its growth as an authority in the green and natural space and help customers live a better lifestyle. In addition to moving its headquarters to Chicago this past October, the company is making key investments towards marketing, talent acquisition, technology enhancements, content creation and product expansion.
  "We are excited to lead the round and support the founding team and existing investors in their goal of making Abe's Market the market leader in this fast growing multibillion dollar space," said Avi Zeevi, Co-Founder and General Partner at Carmel Ventures. "Shopping at Abe's Market is an enjoyable, personalized and unique experience that will lead it to become the preferred site for natural and organic product shoppers."

  Companyג€™s System-on-Chip Platforms Boost Wireless Data Capacity in Mobile Networks
  Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced it has acquired DesignArt Networks, a leader in small cell modem and system design for cellular base stations and high-speed wireless backhaul infrastructure. Based in Raג€™anana, Israel, DesignArt offers system-on-chip (SoC) and software products that enable the design of indoor and outdoor small cell base stations and remote radio heads, which allow operators to expand the data capacity of their networks in a simple and cost-effective manner. DesignArtג€™s technology also offers integrated line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight wireless backhaul to reduce the cost of outdoor small cell deployments.
  ג€DesignArt and its products will both enhance and accelerate our initiatives to drive increased capacity and coverage in mobile networks,ג€ said Craig Barratt, president of Qualcomm Atheros. ג€Operators can significantly improve user experience across residential, enterprise and outdoor networks given the greater network efficiencies derived by implementing small cells and heterogeneous networks.ג€
  Mobile data consumption continues to surge, driven by the increased adoption of smartphones and consumersג€™ growing demand for rich content wherever they are. As a result, carriers require cost-effective, practical solutions to increase the capacity of their cellular network infrastructure. High cost and limited availability of licensed spectrum make spatial reuse via small cell base stations an effective approach to achieve the needed capacity gains.
  DesignArtג€™s unique and competitive technologies set a new standard in base station SoC design and enable simultaneous operation of multiple cellular and backhaul modems with low power consumption and high throughput. With this acquisition, Qualcomm adds the DesignArt LTE and backhaul solutions to its existing portfolio of small cell base station technologies and complementary Wi-Fi, Ethernet and passive optical networking (PON) connectivity solutions. With its expanded product portfolio, Qualcommג€™s networking customers and operators will benefit from the efficient integration of small cell and Wi-Fi technologies with various wireless and wireline backhaul options to support the proliferation of indoor and outdoor small cells that provide coverage and capacity exactly where it is needed.

For more than 25 years, Qualcomm ideas and inventions have driven the evolution of digital communications, linking people everywhere more closely to information, entertainment and each other.

  Provides Allot with a leading video caching service offering
  
    Allot Communications Ltd. (NASDAQ: ALLT), a leading provider of service optimization and revenue generation solutions for fixed and mobile data networks worldwide, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Oversi Networks, a leading global provider of rich-media caching and content delivery solutions for Internet video and peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic.
  
  
    This transaction is another milestone in Allotג€™s vision of further enhancing its industry-leading Allot Service Gateway by offering a comprehensive video solution, which now includes both video optimization and caching.  The incorporation of Oversiג€™s technology with Allotג€™s Service Gateway will allow fixed and mobile service providers to effectively manage the ever-increasing volume of video traffic on their networks.  Allotג€™s fixed line customers report that video traffic currently uses over 50% of bandwidth and is rapidly increasing.  On the wireless side, according to Allotג€™s latest Global MobileTrends report, video now represents 42% of mobile data traffic worldwide.
  
  
    Oversi's innovative caching and acceleration solutions help both fixed and mobile service providers to relieve the heavy network congestion associated with Internet video traffic.   Its technology identifies popular content and caches it at the edge of the network, therefore achieving significant bandwidth saving and minimizing long delays in Video delivery.   The end result is a dramatic improvement in the subscribersג€™ quality of experience (QoE) for video applications. By assuring quality of experience, Oversi's solutions enable service providers to offer tiered services at different price levels, increasing average revenues per user (ARPU).  Its solution has been widely deployed at several large and medium service providers to date.
  
  
    ג€The acquisition of Oversi is another step in realizing our Service Gateway vision,ג€ commented Rami Hadar, Allotג€™s President and CEO.   ג€By adding video caching, Allot now offers its customers a comprehensive video solution that includes the critical caching and optimization services required to manage the ever-increasing volume of over-the-top video on the Internet.  Over the past year, we have seen an increase in customer interest in video caching solutions, which made clear to us the critical need for Allot to own a leading solution in this growing market instead of reselling a third-party offering.  With our shared vision of enabling service providers to monetize video traffic, we are excited about incorporating another excellent team and product offering into Allot.ג€
  
  
    ג€By joining Allot, we will now be able to further our joint market vision more effectively,ג€ commented Oversiג€™s CEO, David Tolub.  ג€While we have seen growing traction for our leading edge caching solutions, we believe that integrating our solution into the Allot Service Gateway will accelerate our market penetration by offering a more robust video solution.  We are excited about joining the Allot team.ג€ 
  
  
    Under the terms of the acquisition, Allot will be paying $16 million in cash, as well as up to $5 million based on Oversiג€™s performance during 2012.  The acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, and is expected to close during the third quarter of 2012.  On a non-GAAP basis, management currently anticipates the following:

MacroCure is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacturing and marketing of advanced cell therapy products for difficult-to-heal wounds. The Company’s leading product, CureXcell™, is a unique biotherapeutic agent which offers a new clinical approach using a complement of activated cells to heal a chronic stalled wound. CureXcell™ was approved for the treatment of chronic wounds in Israel in 1999 and since then has been used in the treatment of more than 4,500 patients with excellent safety and efficacy profiles. The product is easy to use and is administered to patients once a month. Earlier this year, CureXcell™ was approved for reimbursement by the Israeli Ministry of Health (Health Basket). MacroCure plans to begin a multinational Phase III study under an SPA, in the US, Canada and Israel in the second quarter of 2011, for lower extremity ulcers in diabetic patients. The unmet need for effective treatment for difficult-to-heal chronic wounds is large and growing. There are more than 6 million chronic ulcers sufferers in the USA who face potentially devastating outcomes including amputations and death. The attainment of FDA marketing approval will create a huge market opportunity for MacroCure. Jonathan Kolber, General Partner of Viola PE, commented today: "MacroCure is a very exciting company with a breakthrough product platform and a strong and experienced management team. We were impressed by the rare confluence of events whereby a phase III trial is undertaken for a treatment that has already benefitted thousands of patients at its host country, showing both safety and efficacy.” Mitchell Shirvan, MacroCure’s CEO, noted: “We are excited to be partnering with such a prestigious investment group in order to support MacroCure’s growth, and look forward to working with Viola PE towards a successful Phase III trial in North America and Israel and to expanding our global markets.” About MacroCure MacroCure is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of advanced cell therapy products. The company's first focus of interest is in the arena of wound care. The technology employs a complement of activated white blood cells which are administered directly to the most appropriate areas in the wound to convey a natural environment for wound healing. This is a novel concept for wound therapy. MacroCure currently manufactures and markets its lead product, CureXcell™, in Israel for difficult-to-heal wound treatment. MacroCure plans to begin a multinational Phase III study under an SPA, in the US, Canada and Israel in the second quarter 2011, for lower extremity ulcers in diabetic patients. CureXcell™ demonstrated favorable results for standard of care (SOC) when treating various chronic wounds. Clinical trials in Israel have shown a 90% reduction of the mortality rate in patients with deep sternal wound infections and a markedly improved healing rate for severe pressure ulcers. Since the introduction of CureXcell™ to the market, more than 4,500 patients have been treated in Israel with this advanced cell therapy. No serious adverse events have been reported. MacroCure was founded in 2008 by Zeev Bronfeld, who serves as a director of a number of leading publically-traded Israeli biotech companies including: Protalix Ltd. (AMEX:PLX) and Biocell, and David Ben-Ami (Chairman), formerly CEO of Boston Scientific-Israel and Director of Business Development of Teva-Israel.

  Herzliya, Israel, November 28, 2010 – Viola Private Equity ("Viola PE") has completed its investment of approximately $27 million in Degania Silicone Ltd. ("Degania"). Following the investment, Viola PE will hold approximately 40% in Degania Silicone. Approximately $22 million was used to purchase ordinary shares from existing shareholders, principally Kibbutz Degania Beit, and the remaining amount is being invested into the Company. Following the investment, Viola PE will become the largest shareholder in the Company and as such will have majority in the Company's Board of Directors. Viola joins Israel Growth Investors private equity fund (“IGI”) who invested in Degania in 2006 and has decided to maintain its holdings in the Company. Tirza Florentin, General Partner of IGI, stated: ”We are very pleased that Viola has completed this transaction and are looking forward to the next stage of an extremely rewarding investment in Degania”. Mr. Jonathan Kolber, General Partner of Viola PE, has been appointed as the Chairman. Viola PE has appointed another 3 board members: Ms. Osnat Ronen, General Partner, Mr. Barak Salomon, Principal and Mr. David Ben-Ami, a biomedical expert, previously CEO of Boston Scientific Israel. Degania Silicone is a medical device company, established in 1984 by Kibbutz Degania Bet. The Company develops and manufactures high quality silicone products.

Degania's primary focus is the custom-made production of finished products for world leaders in the medical device industry. The Company employs more than 900 people, half of them at its ultra-modern plant in India, and has additional subsidiaries in France, the US and Germany, thus offering local support to the European and American markets, respectively. Jonathan Kolber, General Partner of Viola, commented today: "Degania constitutes Viola PE's largest investment and also represents the first transaction for the fund in which we receive majority in the Company's board of directors. We have been studying Degania for over a year, and were highly impressed with the Company's strong and experienced management led by CEO Amos Nahir; engineering know-how and manufacturing capabilities; as well as operational excellence – meeting AAA customer’s requirements through competitive-price manufacturing in Israel and India. Based on our studies of the Company, we believe it has a unique value proposition and business model. We look forward to a mutually beneficial partnership with Kibbutz Degania Beit, IGI and the Company's management." Amos Nahir, Degania's CEO for the past 14 years, noted: “We believe the new ownership structure will give our Company an even stronger financial position and enable us to leverage its worldwide potential with an aggressive approach. Our goal is to become a leading global supplier within the medical device industry. We have developed the Company with the support of the Kibbutz and IGI, for which we are thankful. Having Viola PE join together with the existing shareholders will surely contribute to achieving the Company’s global strategic growth plans.”

Most recently, eXelate has been focusing on enhancing these tools to uniquely address the needs of publishers. With the launch of their 
    
      teXi: Data Management and Private Marketplace toolsets for publishers
    
    , eXelate has broken new ground in giving publishers an easy way to centralize data management, privacy and latency monitoring and data monetization functions.ֲ eXelate will be leveraging the proceeds from the new round of investment to continue to enhance its data marketplace footprint, as well as expand the functionality of its robust data management toolset.

    ג€If youג€™re going to enter a new market, whether as an investor or as a business partner, itג€™s best to do it with the company that is not only a leader, but a visionary innovator in that market. eXelate embodies both of these values and thatג€™s why we have chosen to invest in them,ג€ said Mark Siegel, Managing Director, Menlo Ventures. ג€Weג€™re impressed with the strategies the eXelate team has formulated for helping to expand their integral presence in the audience data driven ad market, and how they have tactically and successfully implemented against these strategies, particularly with their focus on publisher-centric offerings.ג€
  
  
    ג€The entire online advertising ecosystem is driven by data, and no company is better positioned to both supply the industryג€™s needs and help publishers manage this data supply than eXelate,ג€ said Shlomo Dovrat, General Partner and Co-Founder, Carmel Ventures. ג€eXelate has established a unique solution to help publishers combat the challenges of data leakage and continue to build new sources of online revenue beyond advertising. We are excited to be continuing our commitment to eXelate and to be joined by Menlo Ventures, which brings significant added value to the company.

  Will Expand its Prepaid Card Services
Enabling Corporations to Transfer Payments to Their Service Providers 


  NEW YORK, NY August 5, 2008– Payoneer, Inc., a provider of co-branded reloadable prepaid MasterCard® cards, announced today that it received an $8 million Series B investment led by Carmel Ventures. Additional investors in the round include Greylock Partners, Crossbar Capital, Zohar Gilon, and others. Funds will be used to accelerate the expansion of Payoneer’s payment service offerings and to enhance its technology with advanced compliance tools that bring a new standard of confidence to international payments. Payoneer’s offerings simplify the process of making international payments by allowing corporations to pay authorized payees worldwide using prepaid MasterCard cards. As part of the funding, Payoneer also announced that it has appointed Avi Zeevi, general partner and co-founder of Carmel Ventures, to Payoneer’s board of directors. International payments are cumbersome and costly, and as more companies do business with authorized individuals and companies overseas, paying them efficiently is a growing business problem. Since 2005, Payoneer has built an international payments infrastructure that lets companies make recurring mass payments to authorized payees on reloadable prepaid MasterCard cards. Authorized payees gain immediate access to their money in their local currency – or, if they choose, in US dollars – while avoiding the hassles associated with lost or stolen checks, hold times and fees, and the unavailability of online payment methods in certain countries. Using Payoneer’s services, corporations have lowered their cost-per-payment to authorized overseas payees by up to 75 percent, and have enhanced service provider retention rates due to the payment method. Payoneer has placed tens of thousands of prepaid cards into circulation for hundreds of companies. “The fast growing global ‘internet economy’ is creating a new service providers’ echo system which drives many more corporations to seek better payment solutions,” said Avi Zeevi, general partner and co-founder of Carmel Ventures. “Investing in Payoneer plays to Carmel’s strengths and expertise in the Financial Technology space. We are impressed with Payoneer’s founding and executive team and we look forward to join them and the existing investors in supporting Payoneer to become a leader in this fast growing market.” “Traditional payment methods are far less desirable to Internet-savvy companies, particularly when they must pay increasing numbers of people outside the US,” said Moshe Mor, partner at Greylock Partners. “We see tremendous opportunity for innovation in this space, and are very pleased with the progress that Payoneer has made to date.” “Good, honest individuals still have to jump through hoops in order to get paid when they happen to live outside the US and provide services to US companies,” said Yuval Tal, CEO of Payoneer. “We will dedicate much of the additional VC funding to developing technology that will provide better electronic ID systems than required by current Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations in the US – and to further refine our simple to use, yet highly compliant international payments platform.”

      STERLING, VA, November 27, 2006ג€” NeuStar, Inc. (NYSE: NSR), a provider of essential communications services to the global communications and Internet industry, announced today that it has acquired Followap, Inc., a UK-based leading provider of mobile instant messaging (IM) products in Europe and Asia, for approximately $139 million in cash.  NeuStar projects Followap revenue to exceed $25 million in 2007 and to more than double in 2008.  NeuStar affirmed the 2006 full-year guidance issued on November 2, 2006, and confirmed that the acquisition of Followap did not impact its 2006 guidance.
    
       
    
    Followap is a leading provider of next-generation communications solutions for network operators, delivering interoperability between operators and Internet portals in five different functional areas: instant messaging, presence, multimedia gateways, inter-carrier messaging hubs, and services for handset clients.  Working with Europeג€™s leading mobile and fixed-line operators, Followap has a customer base of 17 mobile network operators (MNOs) that have over 160 million subscribers.  Customers, such as Vodafone, Turkcell, 3 Group (Hutchison), Wind and Mobinil, all rely on Followap to provide them with innovative solutions to implement the operator-based, Personal IM service, as well as to provide mobile access to leading Internet IM portals. 
    
       
    
    Followap also works closely with leading Internet service providers (ISPs) and specializes in seamlessly connecting mobile subscribers to their favorite portal-based instant messaging applications, in addition to network operator-based services such as Personal IM.  Followapג€™s advanced IM client solutions have recently been adopted by leading handset manufacturers.  The GSM Association has identified Personal IM as a pan-industry, mobile operator-hosted, messaging service that is a critical complement and an upgrade to existing mobile messaging services, including text and multimedia messaging and telephone-number based presence.  Personal IM will enhance services and capabilities for over 1.2 billion mobile messaging users globallyג€”the largest, fully interoperable user community, short of voice telephony, which generates over $60 billion in revenues for mobile operators and sends over 1 trillion messages per year.  As announced at the annual GSMAג€™s 3GSM World Congress 2006 in Barcelona, Personal IM is scheduled for a coordinated mobile industry launch starting in the first quarter of 2007 across major European and Asian markets.
    
       
    
    
      Strategy Behind Acquisition 
    
    
       
    
    The Followap acquisition expands NeuStarג€™s platform for growth especially in mobile, IP and international markets.  Followap furthers NeuStarג€™s strategy by extending and complementing our current beachhead initiatives in new growth markets such as the GSM Association root DNS service, the acquisition of UltraDNS and the development of the SIP-IX service.  
    
       
    
    First, Followap brings a large community of new customers outside of North America.  Second, it makes NeuStar essential to a new, fast growing service for the wireless industry.  And, third, it enables NeuStar to solve immediate infrastructure challenges the MNOs face in delivering advanced, IP-based services.  
    
       
    
    Followap will form the core of NeuStarג€™s Next Generation Messaging group and will complement NeuStarג€™s SIP-IX suite of interoperability product offerings and services.  Combined with NeuStarג€™s technology depth, the Followap service and product suite will enable network operators worldwide to provide mobile instant messaging to their subscribers across networks and ISPs.
    
       
    
    With the addition of Followap, NeuStarג€™s new mobile IM solution suite will now support:
    ֲ§         Multimedia messaging and real-time communications
    ֲ§         Mobile phone number-based addressing
    ֲ§         Presence as well as soft-state availability information; turning the handset phonebook into a buddy list
    ֲ§         Cross-carrier chat sessions and group messaging
    ֲ§         Location-based information services using presence technology
    ֲ§         Seamless interoperability amongst operators and back-ward compatibility with existing mobile messaging services
    
       
    
    
      Commentary from Company Executives & Industry Observers
    
    
       
    
    Jeff Ganek, NeuStarג€™s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, ג€Strong demand is emerging worldwide for Instant Messaging, and leading mobile network operators in Europe already depend on Followapג€™s products to deliver IM.  Mobile network operators can rely on NeuStar and Followap for the necessary technical and service quality to support their growing IM volumes.  By enabling IM, NeuStar will build on Followapג€™s strengths to deliver essential infrastructure services, in Europe and Asia.ג€
    
       
    
    Dotan Volach, Followapג€™s Chief Executive Officer added, ג€We are pleased to join the NeuStar team.  NeuStarג€™s next generation services, including SIP-IX, support and extend Followapג€™s products, and will enable the combined company to become the leading provider of infrastructure services essential to delivering IP data services over mobile networks.ג€
    
       
    
    ג€NeuStar wrote a number of the key next-generation technology standards, such as the SIP protocol, as well as the ENUM-like directory standards for accessing phone number-based routing and mobile number portability data critical for IM interoperability,ג€ said Mark Foster, NeuStar CTO.  Foster continued, ג€Followap brings operator class-leading next-generation messaging products that, alongside NeuStarג€™s track record as a trusted provider of essential interoperability, directory, and managed services, position us collectively to support the full spectrum of industry needs for these vital services.  The combination will offer messaging, presence, dynamic routing, and interworking services to network operators and internet portal providers around the globe.ג€
    
       
    
    According to Pete Nuthall, Mobile & Wireless Industry Analyst of Frost & Sullivan Europe, ג€Mobile IM is the next major global messaging revenue opportunity, as it represents both the functional evolution of SMS and has an existing 1 billion plus global SMS user base into which it will grow.  Followap is a world leader in mobile IM applications, presence, and inter-carrier messaging.  NeuStar’s unique capabilities include deciphering and interpreting billions of connections initiated by thousands of service providers each day in a neutral and efficient manner.  Combining the two is a significant win for the industry.ג€

CTO is considered as one of the last frontiers in interventional cardiology. A long term, chronic, full occlusion in the artery is leading to organ deterioration and is solved today by either long and complex percutaneous approach (with 30-40% failure) or through bypass surgeries. 
EndoCross solution is offering to the operator a simple and easy to use crossing device, using the "wire of choice" of the operator and mimicking his manual operation. The catheter is totally disposable, does not require investment in capital equipment and requires a very short learning curve.
