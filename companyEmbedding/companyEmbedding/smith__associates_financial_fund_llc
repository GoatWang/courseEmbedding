Headed Off to College?  Pack an Estate Plan


Financial Tips for Surviving a “Gray” Divorce


Measuring the Value of a Financial Advisor





by Mark Smith, CFP®, CPA/PFS, CIMA®




by McKenzie Ebbesen, CFP®




by Mark Smith, CFP®, CPA/PFS, CIMA®











This time of year, many parents and their teenagers are thinking ahead to the start of college.  As you help your teenager prepare for the school year, don’t forget to pack one very important item – an estate plan.  In this post, Mark explains why this is important, and shares three specific documents you can start with.




According to a study by the Pew Research Center, divorce cases are increasing across the board, but Baby Boomers appear to be leading the way. We are now seeing an upsurge in so-called “gray” divorce.  In this post, McKenzie shares some positive steps you can take if you experience a divorce later in life, and financial areas you can look into right now in order to be prepared.




Within the financial services sector, advisors spend a lot of time thinking and talking about how best to add value to their clients’ lives. In this post, Mark clearly explains our value proposition, referencing six key areas.  He also shares a short handout that specifically outlines what you see and don’t see when you work with us.

*The Forbes ranking of America's Top Wealth Advisors, developed by SHOOK Research, is based on an algorithm of qualitative and quantitative data, rating thousands of wealth advisors with a minimum of seven years of experience. Ranking algorithm is based on quality of practice, including: telephone and in-person interviews, client retention, industry experience, review of compliance records, firm nominations; and quantitative criteria, including: assets under management and revenue generated for their firms. Investment performance is not a criteria because client objectives and risk tolerances vary, and advisors rarely have audited performance reports. Rankings are based on the opinions of SHOOK Research, LLC which does not receive compensation from the advisors or their firms in exchange for placement on the ranking. Research Summary (as of July 2016): 11,235 Advisor nominations were received, based on thresholds. 4,000 Advisors were invited to complete the online survey. 2,500 Advisors were interviewed by telephone. 425 Advisors were interviewed in person at the Advisors' location. Final list of the top 200 Advisors was then compiled based upon the quantitative criteria. Raymond James is not affiliated with Forbes or Shook Research, LLC. This ranking is not indicative of future investment performance, is not an endorsement, and may not be representative of individual clients' experience. Neither Raymond James nor any of its Financial Advisors or RIA firms pay a fee in exchange for this award/rating.  Barron's Top 1200 Advisors - Winner's Circle, a Barron's research organization, produced the rankings based on data provided by over 4,000 individual advisors and their firms. Advisor data is confirmed via regulatory databases, cross-checks with securities firms and conversations with individual advisors. Among the factors considered for the rankings are assets under management, revenue that the advisors generate for their firms and the quality of their practices. Data points that relate to quality of practice include length of service, designations held, and services beyond investments offered including estates and trusts, and an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record etc. Investment performance is not an explicit component because not all advisors have audited results and because performance figures often are influenced more by clients' risk tolerance than by an advisor's investment picking abilities. The ranking may not be representative of any one client's experience, is not an endorsement, and is not indicative of future performance. Neither Raymond James nor any of its Financial Advisors pay a fee in exchange for this award/rating. Barron's is not affiliated with Raymond James.   Financial Times Top 400 - The FT 400 was developed in collaboration with Ignites Research, a subsidiary of the FT that provides specialized content on asset management. To qualify for the list, advisers had to have 10 years of experience and at least $300 million in assets under management (AUM). The FT then invited a list of just under 1,000 advisors to complete a survey used to obtain more information on the advisors’ practices. 400 qualified advisers were then scored on six attributes: AUM, AUM growth rate, compliance record, experience, industry certifications and online accessibility. AUM is the top factor, accounting for roughly 60-70 percent of the applicant's score. Additionally, to provide a diversity of advisors, the FT placed a cap on the number of advisors from any one state that's roughly correlated to the distribution of millionaires across the U.S. The ranking may not be representative of any one client's experience, is not an endorsement, and is not indicative of future performance. Neither Raymond James nor any of its Financial Advisors pay a fee in exchange for this award/rating. The FT is not affiliated with Raymond James.

How It Works










Your Fidelity investment professional will work with you each step of the way.

Identify preferences – Based on information you provide regarding your needs and preferences, your investment professional will identify two network advisors who may meet the criteria you have specified for your personal situation. The names of additional network advisors may be made available upon your request.*
Select an advisor – Your investment professional will help make the introductions for you and provide guidance about how to select an advisor who can help meet your unique investment needs.
View assets in one place – If you do work with a network advisor, you'll be able to view those assets and all of your accounts in one place on Fidelity.com.
Continued support – Your financial consultant can continue to help you with guidance and planning as part of your overall Fidelity relationship.














Specialized Services










Once you have identified your preferences, your investment professional can refer you to an investment advisor to help meet the particular wealth or asset management needs of you and your family, such as:

Comprehensive tax planning for individuals, families, and small businesses.
Trust and estate planning, including legacy plans and charitable giving.
Executive compensation planning, including stock option management and deferred compensation plans.
Small-business advisory services, including capital growth strategies and succession planning.














Personalized Advice

Professional investment recommendations, including buy and sell decisions on stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Access to emerging markets, commodities, and alternative investments, such as private equity, hedge funds, and limited partnerships.
Custom portfolio construction based on your personal tax situation and liquidity needs.
Individual portfolio management, including domestic and individual equity, and fixed income securities.

Professional standards – Advisors have been approved to participate in Wealth Advisor Solutions based on their position as registered investment advisers in good standing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and/or any applicable state securities regulatory authorities (or they are exempt from such registration).
Pricing structure – Advisors charge fee-based, asset-based, or flat rate investment advisory service fees (which may include hourly fees).
