Saikou Optics is unique in our ability to capture and stream multiple focal lengths nearly simultaneously and to zoom at ultra-high speeds without compromising optical quality, and to dynamically respond to the requirements of a computer vision controller. The greatest value propositions for adoption of Saikou Optics technology are wherever the ability to see and understand everything in an… · More environment is mission critical and depends on computer vision to derive insights and recommend or take actions. These use cases include applications as diverse as mobile sensing systems for autonomous vehicles, stationary wide area surveillance systems, and scientific microscopes used for scanning multiple layers within human cells.Applications of Saikou's technology in early stages of development with strategic partners include: a passive (camera) system for autonomous vehicles; a multi-channel wide-area object tracking system for defense system testing; and, a microscopy imaging system.

“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

Vision — Saikou Optics
































































                  Vision
                



Enabling cameras to see the world in a different way.Saikou Optics is developing the world’s first fully digital, multimodal lens system. Our lens designs will change the way cameras see the world, no longer will they be the analog eye into a digital world. We are enabling sensors  to capture richer and deeper data. Our approach to lens design will trigger a seismic shift in what the world expects from camera systems in every field of application, from cinematography to autonomous vehicles, from running video surveillance systems to performing endoscopic surgery. Saikou Optics smart technologies will propel lenses into the digital age.

Welcome to the Exhibitor Directory




        The new SPIE Exhibitor Directory provides a simple and fast way to find top-tier suppliers. All the organizations 
        in this database have displayed or will display their products or services at an SPIE exhibition, which provides
        credibility and the opportunity to talk face-to-face. There are no free listings or banner ads to clutter your 
        results, so you can create your "short list" of potential suppliers in less time.  Now you can find products and
        companies via keyword search or filter by technology, application, and/or name of exhibition. If you have suggestions 
        for improvement, please email industry@spie.org.
