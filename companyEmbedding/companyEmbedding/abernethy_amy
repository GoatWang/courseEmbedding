Analyze this situation: Mr. R. is an alert, anxious-appearing, frail gentleman, 76 years old, weighing 65 kilograms. He has been admitted to the hospital two days before with complaints of chest pain. His medication orders included Lanoxin 125 mcg daily every morning. This was the only medication ordered for the morning. On hand on the floor in the nursing station was digoxin (Lanoxin) 0.25 mg/tablet.

His wife agreed. He wanted to know if this meant that his heart problem was getting worse.

Synopsis
About this title




Now in its third edition, this market-leading resource retains the core strengths that made previous editions so successful, while providing the most up-to-date coverage of the science of conducting dosage calculations using a ratio-proportion approach! With a comprehensive math review, full-color drug labels, and critical thinking assessments, DOSAGE CALCULATIONS: A RATIO-PROPORTION APPROACH, third edition contains all of the trusted tools needed to show readers how to significantly reduce errors and increase their confidence in dosage calculation. The book carefully examines both basic and advanced calculations, including intravenous medications and those specific to the pediatric patient. It has been revised to reflect the most current drugs and protocol, as well as the newest regulations on medication abbreviations, new medication administration technologies, and safe medication practices, all in an effort to make this a solid resource and reference for anyone in, or entering the field.

It is comprehensive, and there are lots of opportunities for application and practice.""This book includes all of [the] elements I think are essential.""This text provides the necessary information in a format that is easy to follow."
