Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Boyce, David, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around Batavia, NY and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around Batavia, NY. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.

    See the review5.0 out of 5 starsa voice teacher and early music fanByGeorge Peabodyon April 11, 2009Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseA WORLD PREMIERE RECORDING YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS!This disc includes: "David's Lamentation over Saul and Jonathan" and a small-scale 'St. Cecelia's Day' ode as well as two arias and a recitative from the earlier London version of the 'Lamentation'.William Boyce(1711-1779) wrote this work in 1736 at the age of twenty-four years.  It is a beautifully crafted piece introduced by a deeply affecting two-movement Overture in G minor whose initial gesture momentarily recalls one of Bach's  great laments.John Lockman, a poet, was the librettist for this work having written a poem 'David's Lamentation over Saul and Johnathan'.  Lockman's biblical source for his libretto was in Samuel, Chapter one, and it tells the story of the death of Saul slain by the Amalekite, and of David's reaction.One notable feature of this work is that there is no 'dramatic personae'.  The Chorus acts throughout as in Greek Tragedy, commenting on events and providing spiritual and moral reflections, as well as pacing the drama by suspending it at certain moments. In the recitatives Boyce requires the soloist to cope single-handedly with both narration and dialogue between the characters as the story unfolds. The soloists, therefore, by turns take their roles as narrator or protagonist as the drama progresses towards the musical and emotional heart of the work- a duet of sublime beauty, 'Sad Israel, thy beauty's pride'. Solo violin and voices here begin David's 'lament'.Boyce sustains the melancholy, sometimes broodingly intense character of this dramatic scene (not really an Oratorio) wonderfully well, punctuating the sections of an overly 'lament' character with some vigorous passages of 'accompagnato', in which the mighty shadow of Handel is present.The "Ode on St. Cecelia's Day is found in one version only and was written at about the same time as the 'Lamentation'. It is short for this genre, but covers, in abridged from, the elements of the English St. Cecelia ode of the 17th and early 18th centuries.  Their purpose was to survey the influence of the power of music in the affairs of man, allowing the composer opportunities to explore various emotions such as love, war and peace before bringing in St. Cecelia at the end.Although I enjoyed "David's Lamentation" very much, this small ode of St. Cecelia charmed me and mesmorized me from beginning to end.  It is well crafted and is really enhanced by the presence of Michael George, bass, who sings one of the most fabulous and exciting arias I have ever heard (shades of Handel!) I was captivated from beginning to end, and of course his voice is so powerful and resonant, his diction crystal-clear and his emotional investment great, that I can't thing of anyone who is into this genre, that would not be excited upon hearing it.  The trio with boy soprano,Patrick Burrowes, William Purefoy and Michael George was truly memorable as were the choruses, so beautifully rendered by the New College Choir.An outstanding performance herein by the:Hanover Band, the Choir of New College, Oxford and the following skilled soloists: Timothy Roberts,Harpsichord- Richard Edgar-Wilson,Tenor- Michael George, bass baritone- William Purefoy, alto- Andrew Watts, countertenor- and Patrick Burrowes, boy soprano. The singing of the soloists is superb, with flawless diction, exquisite tone quality and dramatic intensity.  The same can be said of the New College Choir, who is always nigh unto perfection and the Hanover Band as always solid and secure in their playing.For the Early Music Lover especially this is GREAT ENTERAINMENT!!!!In short, this is a WORLD PREMIERE RECORDING and if the overture alone does not tempt you, surely the poignant chorus "For Saul, for Jonathan, they fast, they weep" should do the 'trick'!Just a closing comment that may help you to mentally place this in a musical category.  It is described by some musical historians as a Cantata for Soloists, Chorus and Orchestra.22 comments|
