Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

It should be noted that the prevalence of conditions listed below may not be characteristic of the provider's entire patient population, and in some cases information has been redacted from the original data source to protect patient information.Most Frequently SeenMoreMost Frequently SeenThroughout 2014, Dr. Thomas saw the greatest relative rate of patients with Type 2 Diabetes (61% of Medicare patients) compared to averages for all physicians in his state, likely indicating he is experienced in managing treatment and complications associated with this condition.Overview of Type 2 Diabetes:seriousnessModerateprevalenceVery Commonmonetary costModerate

There are two types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 2 diabetes is caused either by the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the body becoming resistant to the insulin that the pancreas does produce. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes result in blood sugar levels that are too high, which can lead to serious health complications.

Full Description


Diabetes mellitus is an incurable condition where a person’s blood sugar levels can become too high.  In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce any insulin, which causes the blood sugar (glucose) levels in the body to rise dangerously high. Nerves, blood vessels, and organs in the body can be damaged when blood glucose levels are too high. By comparison, type 2 diabetes appears later in life. This page focuses on diabetes mellitus type 2.   There are two possible causes of type 2 diabetes:  the pancreas does not create enough insulin; or, the body develops a resistance to insulin   As many as 90% of diabetes cases in adults are type 2 diabetes. It is more common in adults over the age of 40 and in people of African, Afro-Caribbean, Middle Eastern, and South Asian descent.

                        here is members of the Davis Family. Seated from left
                        to right: H.W. Davis, Thomas Wilburn Davis, Narcisis
                        Morgan Davis (second wife), Nancy Alice Davis, Standing:

                        Davis, Lynn Ann Paralee.
The earliest known settlers on the present site of
                        Dora were, no doubt, James M. Davis and Ezekiel Morgan.
                        Sometime soon after the War of 1812 the families of James
                        M. Davis and Ezekiel Morgan along with several other
                        families left Raleigh, North Carolina, and traveled by
                        covered wagon and horseback to Alabama, settling for
                        a time around Blount Springs, then moving again. In the
                        late 1820s or early 1830s, they found a pretty valley
                        with a creek running through it that they named Horse
                        Creek because of all the wild horses that ran along the
                        banks. They decided to settle there for a life of farming.
                        James M. Davis filed claim to government land Tn Section
                        18, Township 15, Range 5, on February 13, 1830. This
                        land was located along Horse Creek and extended west
                        to the Warrior River

                        of Walker County and Dora having- come to this area with
                        his wife Lydia (1781-1851)-* and his family in covered
                        wagons after the War of 1812 opened up this area to be
                        homesteaded. James was a soldier in the Mexican-American
                        War. (An unusual story is told about James and Lydia.
                        When James was a 'soldier, Lydia received word that he
                        had been declared dead. She remarried and had a baby
                        with her new husband. However, James was not dead at
                        all, and one day he came home from the war to find his
                        wife married to another man, and a new child in his home.
                        James did the honorable thing-—he suggested a duel,
                        with Lydia as the prize. The second husband said he would
                        simply disappear if James would promise to take care
                        of Lydia and their baby.)
                        James M. Davis got a Passport into the Indian/Mississippi Territory in 1816. Soldiers escorted him through Indian Territory and he traveled south and west ending up in what was a little creek with wild horses all around. He lived in a stone house above the creek. 
                        James M. Davis filed for government land on February
                        13, 1830. In the early forties he dug coal out of the "bottoms" and
                        banks of the Warrior River and Horse Creek and boated
                        it to lower river markets. He and Lydia had four children:
                        J.T. Davis (1813-1861), Daniel Davis (1816-1874), Peggy
                        Davis Glover, and Sabra Davis Hood. The J.T. Davis and

                        of the Alabama By-Products mines in this area. During

                        Thomas B. married Jus tine Gray. They had one daughter,
                        Diane D. Browning-, and one grandson, Billy Jack. George

                        2. DANIEL DAVIS, second son of
                        James M. Davis, married Louisa Hoover. (Louisa was born
                        in Armenia; saw her mother killed in a massacre, probably
                        in a war between Russia and Persia. Her father escaped
                        with Louisa and her brother and came to the United States
                        on a cattle boat. Louisa was indentured to the family
                        of a physician named Hoover in South Carolina. Daniel
                        met and married her there and brought her back to Dora
                        to live. She outlived her husband by more than twenty
                        years and continued to run the farm with her children's
                        help after Daniel died. Thus she was one of the few women
                        of her time with private property of her own. She was
                        affectionately known as "Aunt Louisa".) Daniel
                        and Louisa had twelve children: John, Josiah, Martin,
                        Joan, Jake, Bill, Mary, Sarah, Lucinda, Jane, Martha—married
                        Burwell B. Posten, and James Wesley—married Sarah
                        Elizabeth Snow.
JAMES WESLEY DAVIS, son of                        Daniel and Louisa, was born in 1841. James Wesley married
                        Sarah Elizabeth Snow, daughter of the Reverend William
                        Henry Snow and Mary Ann Chilton Snow. On September 21,
                        1861, he enlisted at Jasper as a private in Company I,
                        Fiftieth Alabama Infantry, under Captain B.M. Long. He
                        was wounded in Atlanta on May 12, 1864, and after recovering
                        from this wound he re-enlisted in Company G, Fifty-sixth
                        Alabama Calvary, and served until the close of the war.
                        (There is an interesting story told about his re-enlistment.
                        After he was wounded in the battle of Atlanta, he went
                        home where he found his brother Martin to be AWOL and
                        in danger of getting shot as a deserter. Their mother
                        was so ashamed of Martin that she made James Wesley go
                        back and fight in his place. James Wesley re-enlisted
                        under Martin's name and finished
                        the war as Martin Davis. Later Martin collected a pension
                        on James' service.) James Wesley and Sarah Elizabeth
                        had eight children: Matilda Norman, Daniel Monroe, Mary
                        Angeline, Martha M., Lucy L., Queen Esther Belle, Henry
                        Etta, and James Grover. Both James Wesley and Sarah are
                        buried at Davis cemetery in Dora.

                        a doctor in Cordova for a while. Dr. Daniel and Laura
                        Davis had eleven children: Florine married Kelly Harris,
                        no children. John and Alice died in infancy. Henry married
                        Willie DeWeese. They had one daughter and four grandchildren.
                        Mary married Otis Smith, two children. George married

                        Cousins had one son and two grandchildren.
MATILDA NORMAN DAVIS SINGLETON, daughter of James Wesley
                        Davis, was born in 1876.
                        Although her father didn't encour age education for women,
                        she completed one year at Mississippi
                        Female College in Hattiesburg, then taught school for
                        a while at Barney. She married Edmund Singleton, originally
                        from England, in 1898. Edmund had come to Dora to purchase
                        coal mining mineral rights from Matilda's father. They
                        lived a short time in Jasper, but Edmund was away a lot
                        and soon his wife moved back to her family home, vowing
                        never to leave.
                        Edmund's job as an auditor with the Pratt Coal Company
                        gave him reason to be absent a great deal, so Matilda
                        sold milk, butter, and eggs to supplement their income.
                        Edmund and Matilda had five children: Edmund Davis married
                        Virginia Lee

                        Lawrence Norberg, two children and four
                        grandchildren; James Wesley married Lucille Cunningham,
                        two children: James and Elizabeth and two grandchildren:
                        Iris and Melissa; Margaret Hannah married Herbert Joseph
                        Kuntz, five children, several grandchildren.

New Wilburn & Wilburn DVD/CD combo “Live in the Smokies”





Welcome to the Official online home of Wilburn & Wilburn, the Father – Son team of Jonathan and Jordan Wilburn…continuing the tradition for three generations. Jonathan spent the first 16 years of his Southern Gospel Music career singing with his family, the Wilburns, one of Gospel Music’s most beloved and respected families. In 1996 Jonathan would move to Gadsden, Alabama where he would anchor the lead position with Gold City for the next 12 years. Jonathan’s awards, accolades and accomplishments in Southern Gospel Music are too numerous to mention and Fans are thrilled and honored that Jonathan is returning to the stage. 
He brings with him, no stranger to Gospel Music, his son Jordan. “There are so many people who need to be encouraged in this harsh world we live in, and the gospel of Christ is the only true way they can really be lifted up! Though we are not perfect, God knows our heart, and the yearning we have to see broken people made whole again. Addiction, sorrow, and trouble are not just reserved for the unsaved. They can also be found in the lives of many Christians today. Our purpose is to preach the word through song, so that the unsaved might come to know the awesome God we serve, and to encourage the saved during their time of trouble and struggle. Souls are dying, men and women are crying. Who will lead them to the cross? Win the lost at any cost! “
Wilburn & Wilburn are now taking bookings for Concerts, Revivals and Church Services, if you are interested in booking Wilburn & Wilburn please go to the contact page and send them a message or give them a call. Thank you so much for stopping by the website.
