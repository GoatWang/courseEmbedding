Translating science into innovative diagnostic solutions
















WE HAVE CHANGED OUR NAME
Motion Intelligence Inc. is now Quadrant Biosciences Inc.



We believe the name change better reflects the expanding scope of our research and business interests in the areas of functional assessment and epigenetic diagnostics. What started as a company focused on concussion management has quickly blossomed into a diversified translational medicine venture, with a world class epigenetic bioinformatics platform and active projects in such areas as ASD, geriatric fall risk, Parkinson’s Disease, ADHD, and the gut microbiome.














Better assessment tools mean healthier adults and kids
The difference is in the tools for diagnosis. Quadrant Biosciences works with top academic institutions, medical researchers and engineers to translate breakthrough findings into thoughtfully developed and scientifically sound assessment applications.

Our two evolutionary advancements in concussion assessment and autism detection will have a significant impact on the way clinicians approach the diagnosis and treatment of these serious conditions going forward. Supported through private and state funding, these key technologies will be available in market in 2017.














 

Quadrant Biosciences is pleased to have been selected as a StartupNY company.













Our Research Partners

Quadrant Biosciences is likewise pleased to be associated with several highly regarded research and educational institutions.

Our Goal: Developing smarter assessment solutions
















Planning to Launch in 2017
Quadrant Biosciences is striving to address two of the most important and talked-about health issues facing parents and children today with key advancements in how they are evaluated: Concussion and Autism Spectrum Disorder.














Situation: Concussion
This year in the US alone, 1.6 to 3.8 million athletes will experience a sports-related concussion. Despite increased public awareness, the standard tools used to evaluate and treat a concussion — self-reported symptoms and expert opinion — offer poor reliability and sensitivity. Consequently, many of these injuries are misdiagnosed, creating a heightened risk of serious secondary injuries if the athlete prematurely returns to play.Understandably, physicians are frustrated with the absence of credible tools to objectively and quantitatively assess concussion injuries and the critical return-to-play decision; parents are worried about the health of their children and the unseen consequences of their injuries; and athletes are concerned about the extent of their injuries and unclear about the timeline for recovery.Quadrant Biosciences is currently working on solutions to this problem on two fronts: functional assessment and epigenetic biomarkers. 










Solution: The ClearEdge Assessment System
Introducing the ClearEdge Assessment System, a new standard of care that will integrate clinical best practices into a single system with cloud-based analytics. ClearEdge will offer clinicians a suite of testing applications that are:Comprehensive — Designed to incorporate the clinical assessment of patient symptoms, physical performance and cognitive functionsObjective — Patient test results are quantitatively analyzed relative to prior performance and peer group statistics; this system uses advanced malingering-detection and effort-assessment techniques to limit possible test manipulationClinically reliable — The preliminary test-retest reliability assessment indicates that the system will be appropriate for clinical decision-makingEvolutionary — Academic research is translated to clinical practice; the inclusion of dual-task testing and effort assessment is a first in the industryCost Effective — The system’s low cost of acquisition and short testing interval (approximately 20 minutes) facilitate time and revenue efficiencies using existing CPT codesPortable — The entire system fits in a briefcase; ClearEdge testing can occur almost anywhere














Solution: Concussion Biomarker in Saliva
There has been a big push by researchers to find a reliable biomarker test to objectively diagnose concussion, but thus far it has remained elusive. However,  research we are conducting in cooperation with Penn State College of Medicine and SUNY Upstate Medical University, may change that. Focusing on epigenetic microRNA in the saliva, we have identified a novel and accurate biomarker for concussion in children. Among the significant findings of this research include:Saliva a Rich Source - microRNA’s have been found in relative abundance in the saliva which, when coupled with their unique epigenetic properties, make them attractive biomarker candidatesAccurate Differentiation - Six microRNAs had parallel changes in CSF and saliva and could accurately separate concussion and control casesPredictive of Symptom Duration - The study also showed compelling data that this biomarker may be a better predictor of symptom (headache, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, etc) duration than current standard concussion assessments.Results of this research were presented at the 2017 Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting in San Francisco in May. 














Situation: Autism
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a medical condition that affects a person’s communication abilities and social skills, and often causes repetitive patterns of behavior and a narrow range of interests. The number of children diagnosed annually with ASD has increased significantly between 2000 and 2010, from one in 150 to one in 68.Although there is no known cure for autism, early intervention with behavioral therapies (e.g., Applied Behavioral Techniques) has been shown to reduce the severity of symptoms and the disabling aspects of the condition. However, early intervention requires early diagnosis, and existing diagnostic tests lack the essential specificity to ASD to make them a useful tool for early screening.










Solution: Autism Screening Test
In cooperation with SUNY Upstate Medical Center and Penn State College of Medicine, Quadrant Biosciences has developed a unique test that facilitates the early diagnosis of ASD. Our autism screening test, which involves specific biomarkers, has been yielding impressive sensitivity and specificity numbers. This groundbreaking technology is expected to be commercially available in 2017.

SYRACUSE, N.Y., June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Motion Intelligence Inc. announced that it has changed its company name to Quadrant Biosciences Inc.  The Syracuse, New York-based neuroscience company is involved in the development of functional assessments and epigenetic diagnostic solutions for large-scale health issues.  The new name better reflects the expanding scope of its research and business interests in these two areas. 








Quadrant Biosciences is a Start-up New York company located in the Institute for Human Performance on the SUNY Upstate Medical University campus. Founder and CEO, Richard Uhlig, explained the reasons behind the name change. "In the relatively short life of our company, we have gone from a singular focus on functional concussion assessment to a multi-faceted involvement in such diverse areas as Autism Spectrum Disorder, geriatric fall risk, Parkinson's Disease, ADHD, and the gut microbiome.  Changing the name to Quadrant Biosciences Inc., which references an ancient navigational instrument, reflects our exploration of new and uncharted areas of biological research and technology."
Having their headquarters situated within a well-regarded medical university has played a significant role in this expansion.  "Being co-located at the Institute for Human Performance at SUNY Upstate Medical University has allowed us to interact with top notch clinicians and researchers on a daily basis," said Uhlig. "This has created a fertile, symbiotic environment for the development and commercialization of the latest scientific and medical discoveries – a great example of translational research in practice."
The company has been recently involved in a number of important research findings, among them the identification of epigenetic concussion biomarkers in saliva. The results of those studies, cooperative projects with researchers from Penn State Medical Center and SUNY Upstate Medical University, were presented at this year's International Brain Injury Association Meeting in New Orleans and the Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting in San Francisco.
"I feel honored and humbled to work alongside so many smart and dedicated people," said Uhlig. "With the science in these areas, as well as research tools like NextGen sequencing, developing at unprecedented rates, it's a real exciting time for us."
