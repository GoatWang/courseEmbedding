Conscious Capital for Healthcare

In the practice of Medicine, the patient always comes first. For years the principals at Spindletop have practiced this core value in all of our interactions with our portfolio companies, our investors, our colleagues, and our employees. Our core value of Generosity recognizes that by doing well financially, we know that we are also doing good, providing benefits for our academic institutions, community, and patients worldwide. We recognize that there are many ways to create value and generate asymmetric returns. We believe that by sharing a long term vision with exemplary companies, driven by purpose and built on a strong foundation of exceptional leadership and culture, we will create significant value for all stakeholders.
Spindletop Capital recognizes that the one common characteristic between many of the most successful companies including Amazon, Whole Foods, 3M, Disney, UPS, Starbucks, and Southwest Airlines is their practice of Conscious Capitalism. As noted by Raj Sisodia and his co-authors Wolfe and Sheth in their book Firms of Endearment: How World-Class Companies Profit from Passion and Purpose, “Today’s greatest companies are fueled by passion and purpose, not cash. They earn large profits by helping all their stakeholders thrive: customers, investors, employees, partners, communities, and society. These rare, authentic firms of endearment act in powerfully positive ways that stakeholders recognize, value, admire, and even love. They make the world better by the way they do business-and the world responds.” From 1998-2013, Sisodia and his colleagues found that firms driven by purpose and passion outperformed the S&P 500 by 14x (up 1681% in 15 years).
Conscious Capitalism recognizes that all stakeholders are interconnected: management, shareholders, investors, customers, vendors and communities. The four basic tenants of a Conscious Business, as defined by Whole Foods co-Founder John Mackey and Raj Sisodia in their book Conscious Capitalism are, “Purpose, Stakeholder Orientation, Conscious Leadership, and Conscious Culture.” Businesses that inspire (Higher Purpose), benefit all stakeholders including their employees, vendors, customers, community, investors (Stakeholder Orientation), run by leaders focused on alignment of interests that create a culture for the business to thrive will be extremely successful by any measure.
We encourage you to learn more about Conscious Capitalism and view Dr. Sisodia’s talk Reimagining Capitalism.

From Our Partners
Spindletop partners with exceptional leaders to invest in transformational healthcare companies.




“ A successful leadership environment is one that steps back from the whole system, builds a more collaborative and innovative organism, that competitively sustains itself over the long term. Spindletop exhibits this model through its strategic, sector and functional sets of competencies, which are particularly additive to the long term success of its partnership Companies.”
– Brett Craig, CEO of QSpex Technologies




“Any successful partnership is rooted much deeper than a simple quest for a return on investment. Spindletop has proven to walk lock step with HNI on its path to truly transform how healthcare is provided in the inpatient setting.”
– Michael Gonzales, CEO and President of HNI Healthcare




“Spindletop has been an excellent collaborative partner – using their extensive network and business-building skills, they help companies navigate complex issues to a successful outcome.”
– Garheng Kong, Managing Partner at HealthQuest Capital




“ Evan Melrose, Spindletop’s founder, has been a long term partner and advisor. He led one of BioForm’s early rounds, and provided guidance, wisdom and a long term perspective throughout our work to grow the company over several years. Evan and the team at Spindletop provide strategic guidance to portfolio companies, and bring to their companies a range of relationships in industry, medicine, academic centers, and the investment community that are invaluable to an entrepreneur.”
– Steve Basta, CEO AlterGInc




“Evan has been a key contributor to the success of Ortho Kinematics. He has worked tirelessly on behalf of the company, contributing his energy, contacts, and insights to help the company at each stage. He has a great mix of medical, technical, operating, and financial savvy, which is a rare combination. Rarer still is his willingness to do real work on behalf of his companies–on several occasions he has literally cleared his calendar to be available when we needed him. ”
– Adam Deitz, Founder and CTO of OrthoKinematics




“Evan and the Spindletop team approach their investments collaboratively, when necessary providing additional strategic and/or financial advisory resources to make sure early to mid-stage companies are preparing properly for what is coming around the next corner. ”
– David Rubin, Managing Director of Merck Global Health Innovation Fund
