DENVER, May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Farmland Partners Inc. (NYSE:    FPI) (the "Company") today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.








First Quarter Highlights

Reported operating revenues of $7.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, a 52% increase over the same period last year 
Completed acquisitions of 34,357 acres for an aggregate value of $360.5 million, bringing the Company's portfolio to nearly $1.0 billion in diversified farmland assets 
Terminated the Prudential Sub-Advisory agreement and other property management agreements as of March 31, 2017 completing the integration of the American Farmland Company ("AFCO") properties into the Company's existing portfolio and saving approximately $8 million of future fees through October 2019 
Reported AFFO per share of $0.01 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 
Declared a dividend of $0.1275 per share ($0.51 annualized) for the first quarter of 2017 – a 4.72% distribution rate based on the Company's closing stock price on Monday, May 8, 2017

"The substantial quarter-over-quarter revenue increase is indicative of the growth we achieved in the last twelve months," said Paul Pittman, the Company's CEO. "A combination of one-time expenses and understated revenue recognition due to the timing of the close of the AFCO merger as well as the effective dates of other new leases during the quarter negatively affected our reported financial performance measures."
Second Quarter 2017 Dividend Declaration 
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1275 per share to be paid on July 14, 2017 to stockholders of record at close of business on June 30, 2017. The annualized dividend of $0.51 per share represents an annual distribution rate of 4.72% based on the Company's closing stock price on Monday, May 8, 2017.
New Indebtedness
During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company increased total borrowings to $437.8 million by entering into two new  agreements with MetLife Agricultural Investments ("MetLife"), which provide for a total of $35.5 million of term loans, and five revolving credit facilities arranged by Rutledge Investment Company ("Rutledge"), with an aggregate capacity of $120 million. Four of the revolving credit facilities with Rutledge were assumed by the Company at the closing of the AFCO merger. A fifth facility, totaling $30 million, was entered into with Rutledge at the closing of the AFCO merger. As of March 31, 2017, the first four Rutledge facilities were fully drawn at $90 million, and the remaining facility had a balance of $2.4 million with capacity of $27.6 million.
During the three months ended March 31, 2017 the Company converted $105.7 million of MetLife term loans from variable to fixed interest rates. 
Acquisition Activity
The Company has completed nearly $370 million of acquisitions since January 1, 2017.
First Quarter 2017 Property Acquisitions 

21 properties in six states totaling 17,817 acres with a total enterprise value of approximately $262 million as a result of the merger with AFCO 
Eleven acquisitions in Illinois, South Carolina, Michigan, Colorado, California, Georgia and Kansas totaling 16,540 acres for an aggregate purchase price of $98.5 million

Second Quarter 2017 Property Acquisitions To Date

Three acquisitions in South Dakota, Illinois and Georgia totaling 1,829 acres for an aggregate purchase price of $7.6 million

In addition, subsequent to March 31, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase one property totaling 1,477 acres for a purchase price of $5.0 million, comprised of cash and shares of restricted stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017.
Operating Results
The Company owns or has under contract over 154,000 acres in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Virginia. 
The Company recorded total operating revenues of $7.1 million and net operating income of $5.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to total operating revenues of $4.7 million and net operating income of $4.3 million for the same period in 2016. The Company recorded net loss of $2.0 million and basic net loss available to common stockholders of $0.10 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to net loss of $1.9 million and basic net loss available to common stockholders of $0.15 per share for the same period in 2016. The Company received cash rents totaling $17.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to receiving $10.7 million in cash rents in the three months ended March 31, 2016.
See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a complete definition of net operating income and the financial table accompanying this press release for reconciliations of total operating revenues to net operating income.
In the first quarter of 2017, the Company did not recognize full revenue for the quarter for a number of leases due to mid-quarter start dates of new or renewed leases, including the leases related to the properties integrated into the Company's portfolio in connection with the AFCO merger. Additionally, the Company incurred several one-time expenses related to the termination of the Prudential Sub-Advisory agreement and the acquisition and due diligence costs in connection with the AFCO merger. Please refer to the First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call Supplement for further detail.
Adjusted Funds from Operations and Adjusted EBITDA
AFFO was $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2016. AFFO per fully diluted share was $0.01 for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $0.04 for the first quarter of 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA was $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company considers the following non-GAAP measures as useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its performance: FFO, AFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of the Company's operating performance. FFO, AFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company.
FFO
The Company calculates FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate related depreciation, depletion and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management presents FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the Company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The Company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the Company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the Company does, and, accordingly, the Company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. 
AFFO
The Company calculates AFFO by adjusting FFO to exclude the income and expenses that the Company believes are not reflective of the sustainability of the Company's ongoing operating performance, including, but not limited to, real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs and stock-based compensation. For this quarter, excluded expenses include the payments related to the Prudential Sub-Advisory Agreement and corresponding termination payment as well as acquisition and due diligence costs in connection with the closing of the AFCO merger.
Changes in GAAP accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in FFO that do not correlate with the sustainability of the Company's operating performance.  Therefore, in addition to FFO, the Company presents AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted, both of which are non-GAAP measures.  Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company's operational performance than FFO. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of the Company's operating performance. Even AFFO, however, does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts, especially in connection with full-year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms. Management considers AFFO per share, fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to GAAP earnings per share. AFFO per share, fully diluted provides additional insight into how the Company's operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess the Company's performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted and, accordingly, the Company's AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted may not always be comparable to AFFO and AFFO per share amounts calculated by other REITs. AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to net income (loss) earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") is a key financial measure used to evaluate the Company's operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, cash flows from operating activities or net income, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that EBITDA is a standard performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors in the Company's industry. However, while EBITDA is a performance measure widely used across several industries, the Company does not believe that it correctly captures the Company's business operating performance because it includes non-cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand the Company's business operating performance.  Therefore, in addition to EBITDA, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure.
The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by adjusting EBITDA for certain items such as stock-based compensation and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs that the Company considers necessary to understand its operating performance. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the Company's ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of the Company's operating performance. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. 
Net Operating Income 
The Company calculates net operating income as total operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements and other revenue) less property operating expenses (property expenses and real estate taxes). Since net operating income excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expenses, other income and losses and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and leasing farmland real estate, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income. However, net operating income should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other income and losses.

DENVER, Feb. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Farmland Partners Inc. ("FPI") (NYSE:    FPI) today announced the completion of its previously announced merger with American Farmland Company ("AFCO"), forming the largest public farmland real estate investment trust in the United States with a total market capitalization of approximately $400 million. The transaction was previously approved by both companies' stockholders at their respective special meetings held on January 31, 2017. The combined company, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, retained the Farmland Partners name and trades under the existing ticker symbol "FPI" on the New York Stock Exchange.








Commenting on the merger, Paul Pittman, FPI Chairman and CEO, said, "We are now the largest, most diversified, most liquid REIT investing in farmland – and we look forward to continued accretive growth." 
Leadership
Paul A. Pittman continues to serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors for the combined company. Luca Fabbri continues to serve as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer for the combined company. Robert L. Cowan, former President and Chief Investment Officer of AFCO, joined the combined company as its President. Concurrently with the completion of the merger, the number of directors on FPI's Board of Directors was increased to eight, and D. Dixon Boardman, former Chairman of the Board of Directors of AFCO, and Thomas S.T. Gimbel, former Chief Executive Officer and director of AFCO, joined the six existing members on FPI's Board of Directors. 
Anticipated Synergies
The combined company is expected to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting a public company platform. As a result of these cost savings and higher capitalization rates associated with specialty crops, FPI expects the transaction to be approximately 10% accretive to FPI's AFFO per share in 2017, growing to 20% accretive as synergies are fully realized.
Operations
The combined company is the largest public farmland real estate investment trust in the nation, spanning more than 144,000 acres across 16 states. On a consolidated basis, the combined portfolio consists of approximately 75% primary row crop farmland and 25% specialty crops (fresh fruits and vegetables and permanent crops) by value. This composition of farmland closely tracks the aggregate value of all U.S. agricultural production, which FPI believes offers stockholders well diversified exposure to high-quality U.S. farmland. FPI generally does not operate properties; it leases its farmland to some of the leading producers in the nation. FPI now has over 100 tenant farmers who grow more than 26 major commercial crops, resulting in broad diversification across the combined company's portfolio.
The Merger
As a result of the merger, each former share of AFCO common stock was converted into 0.7417 shares of newly issued FPI common stock and each unit of limited partnership interest in AFCO's operating partnership was converted into 0.7417 common units of limited partnership interest in FPI's operating partnership. Continuing FPI stockholders and former AFCO common stockholders hold approximately 60.89% and 39.11%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company. Effective as of the completion of the merger, shares of AFCO common stock are no longer traded on the NYSE MKT.
Vote Results 
Approximately 54.65% of the outstanding shares of FPI common stock voted at the FPI special meeting, with approximately 96.22% of the votes cast in favor of the issuance of shares of FPI common stock in connection with the proposed merger.
Approximately 64.61% of the outstanding shares of AFCO common stock voted at the AFCO special meeting, with approximately 99.64% of the votes cast in favor of the proposed merger.
Advisors
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated acted as financial advisor, and Morrison & Foerster LLP and Venable LLP acted as legal advisors, to FPI. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. acted as financial advisors, and Goodwin Procter LLP acted as legal advisor, to AFCO. 
About Farmland Partners Inc.
Farmland Partners Inc. is an internally managed real estate company that owns and seeks to acquire high-quality North American farmland and makes loans to farmers secured by farm real estate. As of the date of this release, FPI owns or has under contract over 144,000 acres in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. FPI elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014.
Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding the expected portfolio growth, the elimination of duplicative costs, anticipated synergies and accretion to FPI's AFFO per share. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
