ESG Completes First OPC Milestone On Schedule, Within Budget

2 days ago

                Panama City, FL, Eastern Shipbuilding has successfully completed its Initial Critical Design Review (ICDR) milestone with the United States Coast Guard on 21 July, 2017 for the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) Program.   ESG’s accomplishment is noteworthy as it occurred on schedule and within the budget constraints set forth by USCG acquisition, and cleared the way to proceed to the next critical milestone known as Final Critical Design Review (FCDR). This accomplishment comes after a weeklong group of discussions, demonstrations, and design presentations by ESG’s design team to the USCG Ship Design Team, Project Management Staff, and Department of Homeland Security.
            



U.S. Sanctions Vens as Pressure Builds on Maduro

2 days ago

                The Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 senior Venezuelan officials as the country's opposition launched a two-day strike on Wednesday, heaping pressure on unpopular President Nicolas Maduro to scrap plans for a controversial new congress.   Venezuela's long-time ideological foe the United States targeted the country's army and police chiefs, the national director of elections, and a vice president of the state oil company for alleged corruption and rights abuses.   U.S. President Donald Trump spared Venezuela for now from broader sanctions against its vital oil industry, although such actions were still under consideration.   U.S.

US-built Liquefied Gas Barge Delivered

3 days ago

                Harvest, an ABS-classed articulated tug barge (ATB) purpose-built to transport liquefied anhydrous ammonia, has been delivered to a subsidiary of Savage Companies by U.S. shipbuilder Vigor.    Harvest is the first complex liquefied ammonia transport barge built in the U.S. since 1982.   “The delivery of this ATB represents a landmark achievement for all of the project stakeholders as well as the U.S. shipbuilding industry,” said ABS Americas Division President Jamie Smith. “The first-of-its-kind in over three decades, the Harvest will help reshape the U.S. fleet and support safer trading in U.S. waters.
            




The Marshall Islands Move to Head of the Class

3 days ago

                Leveraging 27 worldwide offices, the RMI Registry has been gaining market share year-on-year. Surging tonnage and a solid record for safety has pushed the registry to the head of the class.   When the Marshall Islands Registry announced that it had become the world’s second largest – at a whopping 223,262,177 deadweight tons – the registry’s leadership was quick to emphasize quality as the leading reason. International Registries (IRI) President Bill Gallagher didn’t discount the importance of the deadweight milestone, but quickly moved the conversation towards why it had happened.

Transocean Partners LLC launch IPO
Transocean Partners LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company formed by Transocean Ltd., announced today that it has commenced an initial public offering of 17,500,000 common units representing limited liability company interests pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All of the common units are being offered by Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd. The underwriters of the offering are expected to be granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,625,000 common units from Transocean Partners Holdings Limited. The common units are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RIGP.” The common units being offered represent a 25.4 percent limited liability company interest in Transocean Partners LLC, or a 29.2 percent limited liability company interest if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units. Transocean Ltd., through Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, will own the remaining limited liability company interests in Transocean Partners. Transocean Partners LLC will initially take majority holdings in the ‘Discoverer Inspiration’ and ‘Discoverer Clear Leader’ drillships and the ‘Development Driller III’ semisub units. The newly listed company also has the first right to offer for ownership of the newbuilds, ‘Deepwater Invictus’, ‘Deepwater Thalassa’, Deepwater Proteus’, Deepwater Pontus’, Deepwater Poesidon’ and ‘Deepwater Conqueror’ units, should Transocean Ltd decide to sell the assets.



11 Mar 2010

Discoverer Inspiration Begins Five-Year Contract With Chevron
Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) today announced that the newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship Discoverer Inspiration has commenced operations for Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico under a five-year drilling contract. The dynamically positioned double-hulled Discoverer Inspiration includes the most advanced drilling capabilities in the offshore drilling industry. The vessel is an enhanced version of Transocean's three predecessor Enterprise-class drillships, which have set deepwater drilling records in recent years, including the world water-depth drilling record of 10,011 feet set by the Discoverer Deep Seas while working for Chevron in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
