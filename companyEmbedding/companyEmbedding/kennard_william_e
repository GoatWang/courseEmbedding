Early life and education[edit]
Kennard is a graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School.
Biography[edit]
Carlyle group[edit]
Prior to becoming Ambassador, Kennard was Managing Director of The Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with over $100 billion under management. Kennard joined The Carlyle Group in May 2001, where he led investments in the telecommunications and media sectors.
Work with the FCC[edit]
Before his appointment as FCC Chairman, Kennard served as the FCC’s general counsel from 1993 until 1997. He joined the FCC from the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand (now DLA Piper) where he was a partner and member of the firm’s board of directors.
Before joining The Carlyle Group, Kennard served as chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from November 1997 to January 2001. He presided over the agency at an historic time. During his tenure, he shaped policies that created an explosion of new wireless phones, brought the Internet to a majority of American households, and resulted in billions of dollars of investment in new broadband technologies. At the same time, he implemented bold new policies to bridge the digital divide in the United States and around the world.
Kennard is well known for his advocacy for people at risk of being stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide. He implemented the FCC’s e-rate program, which brought the Internet to almost every school and library in the United States. Under Kennard’s leadership, the FCC dramatically expanded access to communications technologies for people with disabilities. The FCC also adopted policies to increase telephone service to rural areas, especially to Native Americans living on tribal lands. He reached out to create more ownership and employment opportunities for women and minorities.
As FCC chairman, Kennard promoted the benefits of technology worldwide. He pioneered an innovative FCC Development Initiative to assist countries in the developing world to participate more fully in the global growth of digital technology. Through this initiative, Kennard signed the first partnership agreements on behalf of the FCC with ten countries on four continents to share U.S. regulatory experience with emerging regulatory authorities.
U.S. News & World Report dubbed Kennard a “consumer champion for the digital age.” He has received many honors and awards for his accomplishments, including honorary degrees from Howard University, Gallaudet University and Long Island University and awards from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the Easter Seals Foundation, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
Kennard currently serves on the boards of directors of AT&T Inc., Ford Motor Company, MetLife Inc. and Duke Energy. Previously, he served on the boards of directors of The New York Times Company, Sprint Nextel Corporation (national US wireless carrier), Handspring, Inc. (manufacturer of the Treo and other wireless devices), eAccess Ltd. (national Japanese wireless carrier), as well as on the boards of several companies owned by The Carlyle Group.
Work as EU ambassador[edit]
William E. Kennard was the first U.S. Ambassador to the European Union to work with the institutions created by the EU’s Lisbon Treaty,[4] including the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the President of the European Council, and the European External Action Service. He also strengthened ties and encouraged dialogue with the increasingly powerful European Parliament.
During his time in Brussels, Ambassador Kennard made reinvigorating the U.S.-EU economic relationship and eliminating regulatory barriers his top priorities. He was a key force behind the February 2013 decision to launch negotiations on an ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which aims to expand trade and investment across the Atlantic and contribute to the development of rules that will strengthen the multilateral trading system. He also worked to revitalize the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) so that it could better fulfill its mission of promoting economic growth through increased trade and job creation.
Ambassador Kennard helped cement close U.S.-EU coordination on a range of common foreign policy priorities, including the Balkans, Libya and the transitions in the Middle East, and the adoption of historic non-proliferation sanctions against Iran and North Korea. He worked to ensure that the EU “pivoted” with the U.S. when it came to dealing with Asia and integrating emerging powers into the global system. He was a tireless advocate of the need for the EU and U.S. to work out compatible data privacy regimes in a manner that protects the personal data of citizens while facilitating the flow of commerce and allowing for effective law enforcement cooperation.
He was also the first U.S. Ambassador to the EU to actively engage with European audiences through social media. One notable event took place in February 2013, when Ambassador Kennard and EU Ambassador to the U.S. João Vale de Almeida co-hosted a “Transatlantic Twittersation,” a virtual conversation whose hashtag #AskAmbs reached 1,400,000 impressions worldwide.
Boards and memberships[edit]
Kennard also serves on the boards of directors of nonprofit and charitable organizations. He currently serves as a Fellow of the Yale Corporation (Yale University) and is a member of the boards of directors of the International African American Museum and the Center for a New American Security. He also serves on Secretary of State John Kerry's Foreign Policy Advisory Board.
Accolades[edit]
In May 2012, the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union awarded Ambassador Kennard its highest honor, the Transatlantic Business Award, for his contribution to improving transatlantic relations, removing barriers to trade, and promoting issues and policies that support U.S. businesses operating in Europe.

Kennard is well known for his advocacy for people at risk of being stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide. He implemented the FCC’s e-rate program, which brought the Internet to almost every school and library in the United States. Under Kennard’s leadership, the FCC dramatically expanded access to communications technologies for people with disabilities. The FCC also adopted policies to increase telephone service to rural areas, especially to Native Americans living on tribal lands. He reached out to create more ownership and employment opportunities for women and minorities.
As FCC chairman, Kennard promoted the benefits of technology worldwide. He pioneered an innovative FCC Development Initiative to assist countries in the developing world to participate more fully in the global growth of digital technology. Through this initiative, Kennard signed the first partnership agreements on behalf of the FCC with ten countries on four continents to share U.S. regulatory experience with emerging regulatory authorities.
U.S. News & World Report dubbed Kennard a “consumer champion for the digital age.” He has received many honors and awards for his accomplishments, including honorary degrees from Howard University, Gallaudet University and Long Island University and awards from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the Easter Seals Foundation, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
Kennard currently serves on the boards of directors of AT&T Inc., Ford Motor Company, MetLife Inc. and Duke Energy. Previously, he served on the boards of directors of The New York Times Company, Sprint Nextel Corporation (national US wireless carrier), Handspring, Inc. (manufacturer of the Treo and other wireless devices), eAccess Ltd. (national Japanese wireless carrier), as well as on the boards of several companies owned by The Carlyle Group.
Work as EU ambassador[edit]
William E. Kennard was the first U.S. Ambassador to the European Union to work with the institutions created by the EU’s Lisbon Treaty,[4] including the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the President of the European Council, and the European External Action Service. He also strengthened ties and encouraged dialogue with the increasingly powerful European Parliament.
During his time in Brussels, Ambassador Kennard made reinvigorating the U.S.-EU economic relationship and eliminating regulatory barriers his top priorities. He was a key force behind the February 2013 decision to launch negotiations on an ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which aims to expand trade and investment across the Atlantic and contribute to the development of rules that will strengthen the multilateral trading system. He also worked to revitalize the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) so that it could better fulfill its mission of promoting economic growth through increased trade and job creation.
Ambassador Kennard helped cement close U.S.-EU coordination on a range of common foreign policy priorities, including the Balkans, Libya and the transitions in the Middle East, and the adoption of historic non-proliferation sanctions against Iran and North Korea. He worked to ensure that the EU “pivoted” with the U.S. when it came to dealing with Asia and integrating emerging powers into the global system. He was a tireless advocate of the need for the EU and U.S. to work out compatible data privacy regimes in a manner that protects the personal data of citizens while facilitating the flow of commerce and allowing for effective law enforcement cooperation.
He was also the first U.S. Ambassador to the EU to actively engage with European audiences through social media. One notable event took place in February 2013, when Ambassador Kennard and EU Ambassador to the U.S. João Vale de Almeida co-hosted a “Transatlantic Twittersation,” a virtual conversation whose hashtag #AskAmbs reached 1,400,000 impressions worldwide.
Boards and memberships[edit]
Kennard also serves on the boards of directors of nonprofit and charitable organizations. He currently serves as a Fellow of the Yale Corporation (Yale University) and is a member of the boards of directors of the International African American Museum and the Center for a New American Security. He also serves on Secretary of State John Kerry's Foreign Policy Advisory Board.
Accolades[edit]
In May 2012, the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union awarded Ambassador Kennard its highest honor, the Transatlantic Business Award, for his contribution to improving transatlantic relations, removing barriers to trade, and promoting issues and policies that support U.S. businesses operating in Europe.

Early life and education[edit]
Kennard is a graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School.
Biography[edit]
Carlyle group[edit]
Prior to becoming Ambassador, Kennard was Managing Director of The Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with over $100 billion under management. Kennard joined The Carlyle Group in May 2001, where he led investments in the telecommunications and media sectors.
Work with the FCC[edit]
Before his appointment as FCC Chairman, Kennard served as the FCC’s general counsel from 1993 until 1997. He joined the FCC from the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand (now DLA Piper) where he was a partner and member of the firm’s board of directors.
Before joining The Carlyle Group, Kennard served as chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from November 1997 to January 2001. He presided over the agency at an historic time. During his tenure, he shaped policies that created an explosion of new wireless phones, brought the Internet to a majority of American households, and resulted in billions of dollars of investment in new broadband technologies.

Accolades[edit]

William E. Kennard
Member, Board of Directors, Ford Motor Company
William E. Kennard was elected to the Ford Motor Company board of directors in 2015. He serves on the nominating and governance committee.
Kennard is non-executive chairman and cofounder of Velocitas Partners, an asset management firm, and is a member of the operating executive board of Staple Street Capital, a private equity firm. He serves on the board of AT&T, MetLife and Duke Energy Corporation. He has a rich history with telecommunications and media industries, having served as director of several public companies including Sprint Corporation, FON Group (formerly Sprint Nextel Corporation), The New York Times Company and Dex Media, as well as a number of private companies.

Kennard served as United States Ambassador to the European Union from 2009 to 2013, working to promote transatlantic trade and investment and to eliminate regulatory barriers to commerce. He was a key force behind President Barack Obama’s decision in 2013 to launch negotiations on the ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that aims to expand trade and investment across the Atlantic.

From 2001 to 2009, Kennard was managing director of global private equity firm The Carlyle Group, leading investments in the telecommunications and media sectors. From 1997 to 2001, he was chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, shaping policies that created an explosion of new wireless phones, brought the Internet to a majority of American households, and incentivized billions of dollars of investment in new broadband technologies. At the same time, he implemented bold new policies to bridge the digital divide in the United States and around the world.

U.S. News and World Report dubbed Kennard a “consumer champion for the digital age.” He has received honorary degrees from Howard University, Gallaudet University and Long Island University, and awards from Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Easter Seals Foundation, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union.

Kennard has served on several nonprofit boards including Yale University Council, Gallaudet University, Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies and One Economy Corporation. Kennard serves as a fellow of the Yale Corporation and is a member of Secretary of State John Kerry’s Foreign Affairs Policy Board.

 Biography Of William E. Kennard



















As chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from November, 1997 to January, 2001, William E. Kennard presided over the FCC at an historic time. During his tenure, he shaped policies that created an explosion of new wireless phones, brought the Internet to a majority of American households, and resulted in billions of dollars of investment in new broadband technologies. At the same time, he implemented bold new policies to bridge the digital divide in the United States and around the world.
During his tenure, William E. Kennard fought to bring the benefits of a more competitive marketplace to all consumers. His procompetitive implementation of the historic Telecommunications Act of 1996 contributed to the development of a competitive local telephone industry in the United States which has attracted over $50 billion in revenues since 1996. He also shaped the outcome of the most significant communications mergers in history, such as AOL-Time Warner, Worldcom-MCI, CBS-Viacom, Verizon-GTE and SBC-Ameritech.
As FCC chairman, Kennard promoted the benefits of competition and deregulation worldwide. He pioneered an innovative Development Initiative to assist countries in the developing world to participate more fully in the global information infrastructure. Through this initiative, Kennard signed the first partnership agreements on behalf of the FCC with ten countries on four continents to share U.S. regulatory experience with emerging regulatory authorities.
Kennard is well-known for his advocacy for people at risk of being stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide. He aggressively implemented the FCC’s e-rate program by investing over $6 billion to bring the Internet to 95% of K-12 schools and 58,000 libraries in the United States. During his tenure, the FCC dramatically expanded access to communications technologies for people with disabilities. The FCC adopted policies to increase telephone service to rural areas, especially for Native Americans living on tribal lands. Kennard also reached out to create more ownership and employment opportunities for women and minorities.
U.S. News and World Report dubbed Kennard a “consumer champion for the digital age.” He has received many honors and awards for his accomplishments as chairman, including awards from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the Easter Seals Foundation, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and honorary degrees from Howard University, Long Island University and Gallaudet University.
William Kennard is currently a Senior Fellow at the Aspen Institute, Communications and Society Program, in Washington, D.C. The Aspen Institute is a non-profit organization which convenes seminars and policy programs to address the foremost challenges of the new century. Kennard is a graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School. He resides in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Deborah Diane Kennedy, and their son, Robert.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

It is a product of their having lived in the settlement of Kenwood in Kenton in the county of  Devon. The surname Kennard belongs to the large category of  Anglo-Saxon habitation names, which are derived from pre-existing names for towns, villages, parishes, or farmsteads.Kennard Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Kennard was first found in  Gloucestershire where they held a  family seat from very ancient times, some say well before the  Norman Conquest and the arrival of Duke William at Hastings in 1066 A.D.Kennard Spelling VariationsKennard Spelling VariationsUntil the dictionary, an invention of only the last few  hundred years, the English language lacked any comprehensive system of spelling rules.

The recorded variations of Kennard include Kenwood, Kentwood, Kenward, Kentward, Kenswood and others.Kennard Early HistoryKennard Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Kennard research.

Although the search for opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad took the lives of many because of the cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels, the opportunity perceived in the growing colonies of North America beckoned. Many of the settlers who survived the journey went on to make important contributions to the transplanted cultures of their adopted countries.

It is a product of their having lived in the settlement of Kenwood in Kenton in the county of  Devon. The surname Kennard belongs to the large category of  Anglo-Saxon habitation names, which are derived from pre-existing names for towns, villages, parishes, or farmsteads.Kennard Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Kennard was first found in  Gloucestershire where they held a  family seat from very ancient times, some say well before the  Norman Conquest and the arrival of Duke William at Hastings in 1066 A.D.Kennard Spelling VariationsKennard Spelling VariationsUntil the dictionary, an invention of only the last few  hundred years, the English language lacked any comprehensive system of spelling rules. Consequently,  spelling variations in names are frequently found in early  Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents. One person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. The recorded variations of Kennard include Kenwood, Kentwood, Kenward, Kentward, Kenswood and others.Kennard Early HistoryKennard Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Kennard research.

Although the search for opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad took the lives of many because of the cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels, the opportunity perceived in the growing colonies of North America beckoned. Many of the settlers who survived the journey went on to make important contributions to the transplanted cultures of their adopted countries.

FCC Chairman Kennard's 5/5/98 Speech


[ Text Version | WordPerfect Version ]



                            Remarks 
                               by 
                        William E. Kennard 
                            Chairman 
               Federal Communications Commission 
                               to 
							National Cable Television Association
                          Atlanta, GA
                          May 5, 1998
                                
                   (As prepared for delivery)


	Thank you, Decker, for those kind words.  It's great to be here in Atlanta with you all. I've
enjoyed being here and spending time with you.
	Let me begin by joining in the chorus of congratulations to Bob Miron on his stewardship
as NCTA chairman during the past year. 
	And I also want to take a moment to offer my personal thanks to someone who recently
left the FCC, someone who brought dedication and energy to a difficult job.  And that's Meredith
Jones.  As you all know, Meredith recently stepped down as Chief of our Cable Bureau.  I want
to thank Meredith for her tireless efforts and wish her the very best of luck in the future.
	And what a thrill to have Bill Gates here this week.  When I heard Bill Gates was here to
make a major presentation to this convention in Atlanta, I couldn't help but think - what a great
movie that would make:  Gone With The Windows.  
	I hope Bill is still here.  My friend Joel Klein at the Justice Department asked me to give
Bill a message -- tell him, "Bill -- yes we are on for tennis on Saturday, and no, you can't be the
only server."  Joel said Bill would know what that meant.
	Seriously, it is a great honor to be Chairman of the FCC, particularly at this moment in our
history.  I often reflect on how best I can use this position to serve our country.  I believe that it
comes down to two things:  choice and opportunity.
	I want to talk about that today:  choice and opportunity, and what I believe those ideas
mean for you in the cable television business and for the consumers you serve.
	Choice is a simple concept.  It means doing all that we can to maximize the quantity and
quality of choices available to consumers.
	Of one thing I am certain:  a free and unfettered marketplace, in which all providers have
ready access to the consumer, is the best way to foster choice.  It unleashes the capital and
creativity that has made our communications marketplace the very finest in the world.
	Competition is the engine of choice, because competition drives down prices, fuels
innovation and maximizes choice.
	Opportunity is also a simple concept.  Opportunity means that we must ensure that all
Americans get the benefit of choice.  Everybody.  Whether you live in an affluent suburb, a
distressed inner city, or an isolated rural area.  You should have choice.  Because as technology
increasingly defines each person's potential in society, we need to ensure that each and every
person has access to technology.  As a country, we cannot afford to leave anybody behind. 
	During my six months as chairman of the FCC, I have been able to spend time with many
of the leaders in the cable industry, many of the people in this room.  I've shared some thoughts
with you about these issues.  I appreciate your time and your openness and your candor.
	Here's some of the things I've learned.
	This industry is healthy.  Cable stocks are up 155% over last year.
	The cable industry is making huge investments in upgrades, expanding capacity to bring
broadband to the home.
	In 1997, cable companies invested over six billion dollars in infrastructure improvements. 
Around 55% of cable homes are passed today by 550 to 750 Megahertz plant.  By the end of
1998, two-way systems are expected to pass almost 45 million homes. 
	You continue to cluster systems to develop the economies you need for increased
investment.  Cable continues to increase audience share and advertising revenue.
	And Wall Street is bullish on cable. Not only because the product that you deliver today
has become a staple in most American homes, but also because of the potential you have to
provide new services to America tomorrow.  
	That, in my view, is your greatest potential -- to provide wonderful new choice and
opportunity for all Americans.  Today your industry is poised at the beginning of its digital future
-- a future defined by your ability to provide Americans with a wider pipe to pump bits of
information into their homes.
	And, I hope that today's cable industry, and my chairmanship, are remembered for having
ushered in an unprecedented world of choice in entertainment, education, news, information, and
services that are delivered into homes across America to improve the quality of life for all
Americans.  Let's make that our shared legacy.
	From my perspective, the terrific thing about where cable is today, and where it is going,
is that your path is being fueled largely by competition.  Direct broadcast satellites have a digital
product; you are developing one too.  The telephone companies are racing to bring a high speed
Internet access product to the home.  And you want to beat them there.
	That's the way it's supposed to work.  Competition fueling choice. 
	When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it envisioned a world in
which the cable and telephone industries would compete in each others' markets.  It hasn't
happened as fast as some expected.  And not many people thought at that time that the true
catalyst for competition would be Internet access.  But the race is on.
	Now it's not my job to pick who should win this race.  My job is to make sure that there is
a race, and one in which no competitor is advantaged or disadvantaged by government.
	Cable enters this race with some very attractive attributes.
	You've got infrastructure.  Your fiber and coaxial plant can carry information up to one
thousand times faster than simple copper pair.
	And you have pioneering companies that have shown how convergence can work.  Cox,
TCI, Comcast, Time Warner, MediaOne and others are deploying cable modems.  Cox and
Cablevision are bundling Internet access with cable and telephone service.
	And now I hear that you have formed the Cable Broadband Forum to push ahead and get
the word out to consumers.  This is great news.  The cable industry is clearly embracing the future
and bringing it to America.
	Competition is fueling this investment, but digital technology makes it possible.
	I believe that digital conversion is the most important force today in communications. 
When the history of communications in this last decade of the 20th century is written, it will no
doubt be about many of the people in this room.  
	But it will also be, first and foremost, about digital conversion.
	Too often, digital conversion is talked about as a broadcast phenomenon, the assumption
being that the digital needs of broadcasters and cable operators are pretty much indistinguishable.
	You know that isn't true.  Cable is and has been in the forefront of digital conversion.  	Digital, after all, doesn't only mean sharper pictures.  It means new programming.  More
channels.  More services, telephony, Internet access.  New services that will make cable even
more attractive to today's subscribers and continue to lure new ones.
	So what should the role of government be in the transition to digital?  It's a question that
we grapple with every day at the FCC.  
	I believe the role of government should be to foster competition and get out of the way.  I
mean that.  So how do we do it?
	First, we recognize that there are things that government is not very well equipped to do. 
Setting detailed technical standards.  Micromanaging the programming or services you deliver.
Regulation is always a poor substitute for a competitive marketplace.  But it is the only solution if
the market fails to generate competition, choice and opportunity. 
	And so we face some critical choices ahead as the industry rolls out digital.
	This will not be as simple as the conversion from black and white to color because the
conversion to digital involves industries working together.  When RCA introduced color TV 45
years ago, the industry was more integrated.  RCA provided the equipment, but it also provided
the programming that made that equipment attractive.
	But today no industry will be able to roll out digital unilaterally.  Industries -- competitors
-- will have to work together to find technical solutions for things like the set-top box.  You will
have to work together to propose solutions for things like must-carry.  And you will have to find
marketing solutions so consumers can easily adapt to the new technologies.
	My preference is to allow the market to work these solutions out, but fundamentally, my
job is to do everything I can to promote choice and competition.  If the industries don't move
quickly to reach solutions, then government must step in.
	For example, Congress told the FCC to make sure set-top boxes are "commercially
available."  And so next month I will propose an order to implement this requirement.
	I am glad to see that the cable industry is talking to the manufacturing community to work
out technical solutions for set-top boxes.  And I hope that you do reach a consensus.  But you
must do so soon -- because time is running out.
	That order must not be the end of our journey.  As you roll out these boxes, will we at the
FCC hear complaints from some who say that the box denies them access to the customer?  I
hope not.  And I hope you will work with us on this point.  These boxes must promote choice for
the American public.
	So here's my message to you on set-top boxes and a lot of other things:  the best way to
keep us out of your business is to promote choice. 
	Here's another example: Congress asked the FCC to look at must-carry for the digital
world.  Here again, I encourage the cable and broadcast industries to work together on the must-carry issues, many of which go to the transition.  
	But digital broadcasts begin in November, so these issues must be worked out soon.
Otherwise, the FCC will have to take the lead. 
	Of course, these issues become easier to resolve, and the role of government lessened, if
there is competition.
	So I call on the cable industry to work toward a competitive marketplace. 
	I call on you to support local signal carriage for DBS.
	I call on you to develop set-top boxes that do not disadvantage others who want access to
consumers.
	I call on you to work with us to craft program access rules that work better.  Rules that
promote competition without discouraging innovation.
	And I call on you to show restraint when it comes to rate increases.  Americans should be
able to afford these new services.  Competition is the key to making this possible.
	In my meetings with many of you over the past months, you have told me that you aren't
afraid of competition.
	I will take you at your word. 
	When the Commission sought to break open the local telephone marketplace to
competition, cable was an ally.  You know how to fight to open up markets.  Work with me to
bring competition to multichannel video markets.
	Now, I have watched the explosion in the programming side of this industry.  Two
hundred programming networks offer subscribers an abundance of programming, for both the
general and niche audiences.
	Five all-news channels, 24-hour public affairs programming, and bold new networks for
children -- like "Noggin" -- offer cable viewers, like me, a wealth of choice.
	Cable has changed the way Americans get information and entertainment, and those
changes continue. 
	But cable also has a responsibility.
	A responsibility to bring technological advances to America's schoolchildren.  I want to
thank cable for its enthusiastic support of the FCC's efforts to bring America's school children the
benefits of cable, and for your own efforts through Cable in the Classroom and cable's High Speed
Education connection -- a pledge to equip one site in every school passed by cable with high
speed Internet access.  This effort is fundamental to the enrichment of our most important
citizens, our children.
	Getting our classrooms wired for the 21st century was one of the most important parts of
the 1996 Act.  In pursuing that statutory goal, I have taken a lot of heat from those who don't
want America to make this investment in our kids.  Well, I say we can't afford not to invest in our
children.  And I applaud the cable industry for joining me in that quest.
	And I ask you to join me in another quest -- to reach out to the disabled community.
	January 1, 2000, is the next deadline as we ramp up our closed captioning requirements,
but nobody says you have to wait that long.  There are millions of Americans with hearing
disabilities who are anxious to get more enjoyment out of cable TV even sooner.  They are
waiting for you to bring it to them.  So I am asking you to accelerate your closed captioning
efforts.
	And we should not stop there. Video description, for example, would bring television to
persons with visual disabilities.   You have a great product to share with these folks, and I hope
you will do so.
	And I cannot speak of responsibility without talking about job opportunities.
	The communities you serve are made up of rich and poor, people of all colors, people with
disabilities.
	You have, more so than others, brought minorities and women into your ranks.
	This industry can take pride in the work of the Walter Kaitz Foundation.  Since 1981, this
foundation has recruited minorities from diverse professional backgrounds and provided them
opportunities in the cable industry. 
	But there is still a long way to go.  You know this.
	Bob Johnson told me that back when he first founded Black Entertainment Television, he
used to come to these conventions and people who didn't even know him would come up and say
"Hey, you must be Bob Johnson!"  Now, that probably doesn't happen to Bob anymore when he
comes here.  But you all know that much more should be done to make your industry a better
reflection of the communities you serve.
	MSOs like Cox, TCI, and Time Warner have assured me that they will continue to expand
opportunities for minorities and women.  Why do they do this?
	Not to please people in Washington.  But because it's the right thing to do.  It helps them
infuse their companies with new talent.
	It helps them show their employees that they will be treated fairly.
	And it shows the communities in which they operate that they are committed to serving all
people.
	It's the right thing to do.  It's good business.
	I commend the commitment these companies have made, and ask others to do the same. 
And I know that because these commitments are made from the top, they will happen.
	Cable celebrates a big birthday this year.  Fifty years ago pioneers in the cable industry ran
those first cables from mountaintops to remote communities.  They started the industry that you
celebrate today.
	Of course, things have changed.
	But no change will be more striking than the changes we'll see in the first few years of the
next century.
	I am convinced that your industry can be a leader in bringing the richness of broadband
technology to America's homes.  
	I am convinced that this industry can do so in a way that maximizes choice for consumers.
	I am convinced that this industry can lead the way in providing opportunity for all
Americans.
	So I ask you today to join me in working to bring our country choice and opportunity.  If
we do that, Americans will enjoy the very best that your industry has to offer.
	Thank you.

Early life and education[edit]
Kennard is a graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School.
Biography[edit]
Carlyle group[edit]
Prior to becoming Ambassador, Kennard was Managing Director of The Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with over $100 billion under management. Kennard joined The Carlyle Group in May 2001, where he led investments in the telecommunications and media sectors.
Work with the FCC[edit]
Before his appointment as FCC Chairman, Kennard served as the FCC’s general counsel from 1993 until 1997. He joined the FCC from the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand (now DLA Piper) where he was a partner and member of the firm’s board of directors.
Before joining The Carlyle Group, Kennard served as chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from November 1997 to January 2001. He presided over the agency at an historic time. During his tenure, he shaped policies that created an explosion of new wireless phones, brought the Internet to a majority of American households, and resulted in billions of dollars of investment in new broadband technologies. At the same time, he implemented bold new policies to bridge the digital divide in the United States and around the world.
Kennard is well known for his advocacy for people at risk of being stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide. He implemented the FCC’s e-rate program, which brought the Internet to almost every school and library in the United States. Under Kennard’s leadership, the FCC dramatically expanded access to communications technologies for people with disabilities. The FCC also adopted policies to increase telephone service to rural areas, especially to Native Americans living on tribal lands. He reached out to create more ownership and employment opportunities for women and minorities.
As FCC chairman, Kennard promoted the benefits of technology worldwide. He pioneered an innovative FCC Development Initiative to assist countries in the developing world to participate more fully in the global growth of digital technology. Through this initiative, Kennard signed the first partnership agreements on behalf of the FCC with ten countries on four continents to share U.S. regulatory experience with emerging regulatory authorities.
U.S. News & World Report dubbed Kennard a “consumer champion for the digital age.” He has received many honors and awards for his accomplishments, including honorary degrees from Howard University, Gallaudet University and Long Island University and awards from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the Easter Seals Foundation, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
Kennard currently serves on the boards of directors of AT&T Inc., Ford Motor Company, MetLife Inc. and Duke Energy. Previously, he served on the boards of directors of The New York Times Company, Sprint Nextel Corporation (national US wireless carrier), Handspring, Inc. (manufacturer of the Treo and other wireless devices), eAccess Ltd. (national Japanese wireless carrier), as well as on the boards of several companies owned by The Carlyle Group.
Work as EU ambassador[edit]
William E. Kennard was the first U.S. Ambassador to the European Union to work with the institutions created by the EU’s Lisbon Treaty,[4] including the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the President of the European Council, and the European External Action Service. He also strengthened ties and encouraged dialogue with the increasingly powerful European Parliament.
During his time in Brussels, Ambassador Kennard made reinvigorating the U.S.-EU economic relationship and eliminating regulatory barriers his top priorities. He was a key force behind the February 2013 decision to launch negotiations on an ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which aims to expand trade and investment across the Atlantic and contribute to the development of rules that will strengthen the multilateral trading system. He also worked to revitalize the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) so that it could better fulfill its mission of promoting economic growth through increased trade and job creation.
Ambassador Kennard helped cement close U.S.-EU coordination on a range of common foreign policy priorities, including the Balkans, Libya and the transitions in the Middle East, and the adoption of historic non-proliferation sanctions against Iran and North Korea. He worked to ensure that the EU “pivoted” with the U.S. when it came to dealing with Asia and integrating emerging powers into the global system. He was a tireless advocate of the need for the EU and U.S. to work out compatible data privacy regimes in a manner that protects the personal data of citizens while facilitating the flow of commerce and allowing for effective law enforcement cooperation.
He was also the first U.S. Ambassador to the EU to actively engage with European audiences through social media. One notable event took place in February 2013, when Ambassador Kennard and EU Ambassador to the U.S. João Vale de Almeida co-hosted a “Transatlantic Twittersation,” a virtual conversation whose hashtag #AskAmbs reached 1,400,000 impressions worldwide.
Boards and memberships[edit]
Kennard also serves on the boards of directors of nonprofit and charitable organizations. He currently serves as a Fellow of the Yale Corporation (Yale University) and is a member of the boards of directors of the International African American Museum and the Center for a New American Security. He also serves on Secretary of State John Kerry's Foreign Policy Advisory Board.
Accolades[edit]
In May 2012, the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union awarded Ambassador Kennard its highest honor, the Transatlantic Business Award, for his contribution to improving transatlantic relations, removing barriers to trade, and promoting issues and policies that support U.S. businesses operating in Europe.

Early life and education[edit]
Kennard is a graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School.
Biography[edit]
Carlyle group[edit]
Prior to becoming Ambassador, Kennard was Managing Director of The Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with over $100 billion under management. Kennard joined The Carlyle Group in May 2001, where he led investments in the telecommunications and media sectors.
Work with the FCC[edit]
Before his appointment as FCC Chairman, Kennard served as the FCC’s general counsel from 1993 until 1997. He joined the FCC from the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand (now DLA Piper) where he was a partner and member of the firm’s board of directors.
Before joining The Carlyle Group, Kennard served as chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from November 1997 to January 2001. He presided over the agency at an historic time. During his tenure, he shaped policies that created an explosion of new wireless phones, brought the Internet to a majority of American households, and resulted in billions of dollars of investment in new broadband technologies. At the same time, he implemented bold new policies to bridge the digital divide in the United States and around the world.
Kennard is well known for his advocacy for people at risk of being stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide. He implemented the FCC’s e-rate program, which brought the Internet to almost every school and library in the United States. Under Kennard’s leadership, the FCC dramatically expanded access to communications technologies for people with disabilities. The FCC also adopted policies to increase telephone service to rural areas, especially to Native Americans living on tribal lands. He reached out to create more ownership and employment opportunities for women and minorities.
As FCC chairman, Kennard promoted the benefits of technology worldwide. He pioneered an innovative FCC Development Initiative to assist countries in the developing world to participate more fully in the global growth of digital technology. Through this initiative, Kennard signed the first partnership agreements on behalf of the FCC with ten countries on four continents to share U.S. regulatory experience with emerging regulatory authorities.
U.S. News & World Report dubbed Kennard a “consumer champion for the digital age.” He has received many honors and awards for his accomplishments, including honorary degrees from Howard University, Gallaudet University and Long Island University and awards from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the Easter Seals Foundation, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

Early life and education[edit]
Kennard is a graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School.
Biography[edit]
Carlyle group[edit]
Prior to becoming Ambassador, Kennard was Managing Director of The Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with over $100 billion under management. Kennard joined The Carlyle Group in May 2001, where he led investments in the telecommunications and media sectors.
Work with the FCC[edit]
Before his appointment as FCC Chairman, Kennard served as the FCC’s general counsel from 1993 until 1997. He joined the FCC from the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand (now DLA Piper) where he was a partner and member of the firm’s board of directors.
Before joining The Carlyle Group, Kennard served as chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from November 1997 to January 2001. He presided over the agency at an historic time. During his tenure, he shaped policies that created an explosion of new wireless phones, brought the Internet to a majority of American households, and resulted in billions of dollars of investment in new broadband technologies. At the same time, he implemented bold new policies to bridge the digital divide in the United States and around the world.
Kennard is well known for his advocacy for people at risk of being stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide. He implemented the FCC’s e-rate program, which brought the Internet to almost every school and library in the United States. Under Kennard’s leadership, the FCC dramatically expanded access to communications technologies for people with disabilities. The FCC also adopted policies to increase telephone service to rural areas, especially to Native Americans living on tribal lands. He reached out to create more ownership and employment opportunities for women and minorities.
As FCC chairman, Kennard promoted the benefits of technology worldwide. He pioneered an innovative FCC Development Initiative to assist countries in the developing world to participate more fully in the global growth of digital technology. Through this initiative, Kennard signed the first partnership agreements on behalf of the FCC with ten countries on four continents to share U.S. regulatory experience with emerging regulatory authorities.
U.S. News & World Report dubbed Kennard a “consumer champion for the digital age.” He has received many honors and awards for his accomplishments, including honorary degrees from Howard University, Gallaudet University and Long Island University and awards from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the Easter Seals Foundation, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
Kennard currently serves on the boards of directors of AT&T Inc., Ford Motor Company, MetLife Inc. and Duke Energy. Previously, he served on the boards of directors of The New York Times Company, Sprint Nextel Corporation (national US wireless carrier), Handspring, Inc. (manufacturer of the Treo and other wireless devices), eAccess Ltd. (national Japanese wireless carrier), as well as on the boards of several companies owned by The Carlyle Group.
Work as EU ambassador[edit]
William E. Kennard was the first U.S. Ambassador to the European Union to work with the institutions created by the EU’s Lisbon Treaty,[4] including the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the President of the European Council, and the European External Action Service. He also strengthened ties and encouraged dialogue with the increasingly powerful European Parliament.
During his time in Brussels, Ambassador Kennard made reinvigorating the U.S.-EU economic relationship and eliminating regulatory barriers his top priorities. He was a key force behind the February 2013 decision to launch negotiations on an ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which aims to expand trade and investment across the Atlantic and contribute to the development of rules that will strengthen the multilateral trading system. He also worked to revitalize the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) so that it could better fulfill its mission of promoting economic growth through increased trade and job creation.
Ambassador Kennard helped cement close U.S.-EU coordination on a range of common foreign policy priorities, including the Balkans, Libya and the transitions in the Middle East, and the adoption of historic non-proliferation sanctions against Iran and North Korea. He worked to ensure that the EU “pivoted” with the U.S. when it came to dealing with Asia and integrating emerging powers into the global system. He was a tireless advocate of the need for the EU and U.S. to work out compatible data privacy regimes in a manner that protects the personal data of citizens while facilitating the flow of commerce and allowing for effective law enforcement cooperation.
He was also the first U.S. Ambassador to the EU to actively engage with European audiences through social media. One notable event took place in February 2013, when Ambassador Kennard and EU Ambassador to the U.S. João Vale de Almeida co-hosted a “Transatlantic Twittersation,” a virtual conversation whose hashtag #AskAmbs reached 1,400,000 impressions worldwide.
Boards and memberships[edit]
Kennard also serves on the boards of directors of nonprofit and charitable organizations. He currently serves as a Fellow of the Yale Corporation (Yale University) and is a member of the boards of directors of the International African American Museum and the Center for a New American Security. He also serves on Secretary of State John Kerry's Foreign Policy Advisory Board.
Accolades[edit]
In May 2012, the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union awarded Ambassador Kennard its highest honor, the Transatlantic Business Award, for his contribution to improving transatlantic relations, removing barriers to trade, and promoting issues and policies that support U.S. businesses operating in Europe.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
