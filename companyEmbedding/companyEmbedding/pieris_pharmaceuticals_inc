Pipeline
Overview








Pieris has established a proprietary portfolio of unique product opportunities in the immunology-related areas of immuno-oncology and asthma, while also having developed programs in other areas including anemia. Based on the promise of our unique therapeutic approach in immuno-oncology and respiratory disease, we intend to make these two core therapeutic areas of the Company, with each indication now anchored by a major alliance: AstraZeneca in respiratory disease and Servier in immuno-oncology.
Beyond its strategic alliances with AstraZeneca and Servier, Pieris also maintains multi-program R&D collaborations with Roche, Daiichi Sankyo and Sanofi to bring its proprietary Anticalin-based therapeutics to patients in a variety of indications. To maximize the value of our pipeline, we are continuing to explore new partnerships to support the development and commercialization of the technology.  As part of the company’s ongoing transformation into an immunology-focused organization, it entered into a Japanese partnership for its anemia program, PRS-080, and will explore out-licensing opportunities in other territories following the completion of an ongoing Phase IIa study for this program.

Pieris Drug Pipeline
Pieris pipeline includes multiple fully proprietary as well as partnered programs in a number of different therapeutic areas. Our most advanced Anticalin program PRS-080 (hepcidin antagonist to treat anemia), our advanced respiratory program PRS-060 (1st-in-class inhaled IL4Ra antagonist to treat asthma) and several of our immuno-oncology (IO) multispecific programs (PRS-300 series), led by PRS-343 (a HER2/4-1BB bispecific), are examples of our fully proprietary programs. As we continue to build our IO and Respiratory franchises, we aim to ultimately develop Pieris into a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company by retaining commercial rights to several of these programs in major markets. For this purpose, we are also joining forces with other pharmaceutical companies, as exemplified by our strategic co-development IO alliance with Servier, with PRS-332 (PD1-based dual checkpoint inhibitor) as the lead program of this collaboration, to which we retain full US rights. Our pipeline also includes several programs that are developed by our partners including Roche, Daiichi Sankyo and Sanofi Aventis.

Libraries

At Pieris, one size does not fit all when it comes to library development and Anticalin screening. The company's Anticalin libraries are sourced from different human lipocalins, specifically tear lipocalin and hNGAL, and are created by diversifying the core lipocalin binding pocket, which include rationally designed variable loop regions and ligand-binding regions within the beta barrel, to ensure that Anticalin proteins exhibit an optimized drug developability profile in terms of stability, specificity and affinity.
Pieris' discovery platform benefits from its newest iteration of libraries, which have a diversity of up to 1 x 1011. Pieris' libraries have a solid expression profile and deliver highly potent and stable functional Anticalin proteins.

PIERIS PHARMACEUTICALS REPORTS FULL-YEAR 2016 
FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CORPORATE UPDATE 
COMPANY TO HOST AN INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL ON 
THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 2017 AT 10:00 AM EDT 
BOSTON, MA, March 22, 2017  Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PIRS), a clinical-stage biotechnology company
advancing novel biotherapeutics through its proprietary Anticalin® technology platform for cancer and other diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2016 and provided an update on the Companys
recent developments.  2016 was a highly productive year for Pieris marked by: i) broad advancement of our proprietary clinical and preclinical
programs, ii) completion of a $16.5 million private placement financing that strengthened our shareholder base, iii) achievement of several milestones in our collaborative programs, and iv) expansion of our Board of Directors and the
appointment of a Chief Business Officer. At several R&D conferences throughout the year, including in the fourth quarter at the annual meeting of the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC), we presented preclinical data demonstrating a
differentiated mode of action for PRS-343, our lead 4-1BB (CD137)-based HER-2 bispecific immuno-oncology program, which remains
on track for Phase I initiation in the first half of this year, said Stephen Yoder, President and CEO. Our targeted, inhaled asthma program, PRS-060, which engages the IL4a receptor, is
differentiated from systemically administered therapies, and is on track to enter a Phase I study in mid-2017. Pieris has also completed dosing of all patients in a Phase Ib single ascending dose study of our
most advanced program, PRS-080, in dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients and expects to present this data in the first half of this year. 
With these accomplishments behind us, we started 2017 on a very strong note, as we have already consummated a multi-target, multi-year, transformative
partnership in the immuno-oncology space with Servier, the second largest pharmaceutical company in France. This alliance includes our dual checkpoint inhibitor, PRS-332, as well as four additional bispecific
programs and may be expanded to eight total programs. Notably, Pieris has the option to co-develop and retain full US rights for four of these programs, including
PRS-332, and is eligible to receive up to approximately $1.8 billion in total potential milestones, and up to low double-digit royalties on potential future product sales, in addition to having received
an upfront payment of approximately $31.0 million. We also recently announced a regional partnership in Japan with Aska Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for PRS-080, which will allow us to invest in manufacturing
efficiencies and

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
