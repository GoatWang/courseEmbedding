John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. Appoints Christopher Gardier As Vice President Of Consumer Sales






Business Wire




Aug 11, 2010 9:03 AM EDT













 


















































  Christopher Gardier , a leading sales executive with a long history in the snack and consumer packaged goods industry, is the new vice president of consumer sales for John B. Sanfilippo & Son (NASDAQ: JBSS), www.jbssinc.com. Gardier is assuming the role from Ron Williamson, current vice president of consumer sales, who is retiring this fall after a successful fourteen year tenure with JBSS.  Gardier has broad experience in building and leading high-performance sales teams, with expertise in direct store delivery, distribution systems, broker management, operations trade marketing, category management and strategic planning.  He comes to JBSS from the Hain Celestial Group, the nation’s leading manufacturer and marketer of branded natural and organic food and personal care products. At Hain, Gardier was vice president of retail sales in the natural division, where he led a national sales team for the natural product channel with annual revenues of $315 million.  “I feel privileged to join an organization that has enjoyed a long history of success in the snack food industry,” Gardier says. “And, I look forward to building a high performance, customer-centered sales culture in which our retail customers recognize us as the leaders in providing superior nut products and programs that exceed consumer expectations.”  Gardier’s previous experience also includes senior management positions at Pepperidge Farm, Frito-Lay and Kraft Foods.  “We are extremely confident in Chris’s ability to lead and strengthen our sales organization,” says JBSS CEO Jeffrey Sanfilippo. “His record of hands-on leadership and strategic planning is impressive and innovative. He also brings a cutting-edge understanding of causal data that can be used to develop action plans that generate results. Every member of our sales organization will benefit from his mentorship.”  “The addition of Chris to JBSS’s consumer sales effort epitomizes how, over the last six months and with our five year strategic plan in mind, we have been substantially enhancing our sales and marketing capabilities with high quality and highly experienced new team members,” says Rob Sarlls, senior vice president of consumer sales, strategy and business development. “I look forward to his leadership in increasing excellence from our sales team along with enhancing our relationships with customers and prospects.”
