His focus on execution, driving customer loyalty, and maximizing employee satisfaction align well with senior management’s priorities and are critical qualities to ensure the long term success of Green Bancorp. Today, we are in the midst of a return to growth and Terry’s expertise will be vital to the successful execution of our strategy,” said Geoff Greenwade, President of Green Bancorp and CEO of Green Bank.
“This is a very exciting time to be joining Green Bancorp given the significant opportunity that lays ahead. The Company is well positioned to take advantage of the vibrant Texas economy which offers numerous avenues for expansion. I am looking forward to working with the executive management team and the entire Green Bancorp family as we strive to capitalize on those opportunities that we see in front of us,” commented Terry Earley.
Mr. Earley brings a wealth of experience to his new role at Green Bancorp. With over 25 years of banking experience Mr. Earley has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Rocky Mountain Bank and Rocky Mountain Capital, located in Jackson, Wyoming, as CFO of Bancorp of the Southeast, LLC, located in Ponte Vedra, Florida, and as CFO and Chief Operating Officer of RBC Bank (USA). Most recently, Mr. Earley was the Executive Vice President and CFO of Yadkin Financial Corporation and will now relocate from North Carolina to Texas for his new role with Green Bancorp.
