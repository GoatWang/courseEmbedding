About Us















 Anchor name: #djrf_


















Our Story
In 1979, QAD was founded by Pamela Lopker, who was later joined by her husband Karl Lopker, as a small startup solution to address a large gap in complete, integrated business software for manufacturing companies.
We began with a few local customers, supporting them from our headquarters in Santa Barbara, California. But as our customers took their brands to the next level—international—we adapted quickly to keep up. Today we support customers in over 100 countries around the world. Our products have gone global, too, and we have spent years innovating and growing our offering as our customers expand their businesses overseas.
You’ll often hear us say that at the heart of QAD is a strong and loyal customer community. We really believe that to create the best full-featured manufacturing ERP software for our customers we need to work together. We pride ourselves on our customer engagement and our commitment to continually evolve as the manufacturing industry changes.
It’s been over three decades; we still focus solely on manufacturing—we live and breathe it every day alongside you. Become an Effective Enterprise with us.

QAD is a company that provides enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to manufacturing companies.[1]
History[edit]
QAD was formed in 1979 by Pamela Lopker, who remained president and chairman. QAD initially developed proprietary software applications for manufacturing companies in southern California. In 1984, QAD announced MFG/PRO. MFG/PRO was built using the Progress Software Corporation's Fourth Generation Language (4GL) and relational database. MFG/PRO was one of the first software applications built for manufacturers following the APICS principles. MFG/PRO was also one of the first applications to support closed loop Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II), as well as operating in open systems. QAD software supports Lean Manufacturing principles and inter-operates with other systems via open standards. In 2003, a product called Supply Visualization was first hosted in multi-tenant configuration for QAD customers and those customers' suppliers making QAD an early player in providing SaaS software for manufacturing. Supplier Portal (previously called Supply Visualization and Supply Chain Portal) continues to allow customers and their authorized suppliers to share information about inventory, scheduling, purchase orders, shipments, Kanbans, and much more.
QAD stock began trading as of its initial public offering (IPO) on August 6, 1997.[2]
2006 - QAD announced a user interface called .NET UI.
2006 - QAD acquired Precision Software, a company delivering transportation, global trade and supply chain management software to businesses.
2006 - QAD acquired Bisgen Ltd., a UK-based company whose product is tailored to the unique sales force and marketing automation needs of manufacturers.
2006 - QAD acquired FBO Systems, Inc., a Georgia-based company and leading provider of enterprise asset management (EAM) products and professional services.
2007 - QAD renamed its core product suite from MFG/PRO to QAD Enterprise Applications.
2008 - QAD launched a significant enhancement to its core suite with the release of the Enterprise Edition of QAD Enterprise Applications.
2008 - QAD acquired FullTilt Solutions’ product suite, including Perfect Product Suite, called master data management (MDM) for Internet-enabled commerce.
2012 - QAD acquired CEBOS, a provider of quality management and management system standard software and services.
In 2012 QAD acquired DynaSys, a European provider of collaborative demand and supply chain planning software.
QAD sells its products and services to companies in six main manufacturing industries: automotive, consumer products, high technology, food and beverage, industrial equipment and life sciences. The company’s product suite is called QAD Enterprise Applications (known as MFG/PRO prior to 2007). QAD Enterprise Application is designed to streamline the management of manufacturing operations, supply chains, financials, customers, technology, and business performance.[3] QAD Cloud ERP is marketed as software as a service (Saas) using cloud computing. For the full year ended January 31, 2015, total revenue was $295.1 million.[4]
