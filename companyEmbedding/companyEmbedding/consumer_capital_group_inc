(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the operations and financial condition reported in the audited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and related notes included in this report, and those in the Original Annual Report. Those statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature should be considered to be forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain. Actual results and the timing of the events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the "Cautionary Note on Forward Looking Statements" set forth elsewhere in this Amendment No. 1 to the Original Annual Report.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:  Certain statements made in this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A are "forward-looking statements" (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements use words such as "believe," "expect," "should," "strive," "plan," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate" or similar expressions. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current beliefs, assumptions, and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. You should carefully read the risk factor disclosure contained in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Amendment No.1 on Form 10-K/A, where we discuss many of the important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Our plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions of the continuing expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately, and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe our assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, other than as required by law. In light of these assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur and actual results and events may vary significantly from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Overview  We have been primarily engaging in internet financing services since first quarter of 2015. Prior to that, we operated an online retail platform in China at www.ccmus.com through Arki (Beijing) E-Commerce Technology Corp., our wholly owned subsidiary, and an online retail platform at www.ccgusa.com in the United States. In addition to e-commerce services, we tried to develop a debit card business, through America Arki Fuxin Network Management Co. Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary. Prior to April 2014, we also operated our meat distribution business through Beijing Beitun Trading Co., Ltd., our 51% owned subsidiary. Through Beijing Beitun Trading Co., Ltd., we purchased meats from suppliers and distributed them to restaurants and food producers in China. On April 1, 2014, the Company sold its entire 51% equity of Beijing Beitun Trading Co. Ltd. As a result of the sale of our equity in Beitun Trading, we no longer operate in the distribution of meat products. Because of the lack of sales generated on our two online retail platforms, we also ceased our E-commerce business in first quarter of 2015.  We currently operate our business through our variable interest entity, America Arki Network Service Beijing Co., Ltd, which holds 51% interest in America Arki (Tianjin) Capital Management Partnership, a wealth management firm, and Shanghai Zhong Hui Financial Information Service Corp., an online consumer finance platform that matches mass retail investors and companies that needs to raise capital through debt or equity financing.  USE OF ESTIMATES  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The Company's functional currency is the local currency in the PRC, the Chinese Yuan (RMB). The financial statements of the Company are translated into United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, FOREIGN CURRENCY MATTERS, using year-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues, costs, and expenses and historical rates for equity. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in determining comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the cumulative translation adjustment of $(44,436) and $131,528, respectively, was classified as an item accumulated of other comprehensive income in the stockholders' equity (deficit) section of the consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the foreign currency translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (deficit) was a loss of $191,032 and a gain of $68,198, respectively.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.  E-commerce Revenue Recognition  We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the net amount of sales earned as commissions. We are not the primary obligor nor are we subject to inventory risk as the agreements with our suppliers specify that they have the responsibility to provide the product or service to the customer. Also, the amounts we earn from our vendors/suppliers is based on a fixed percentage and bound contractually. Additionally, the Company does not have any obligation to resolve disputes between the vendors and the customers that purchase the products on our website. Any disputes involving damaged, non-functional, product returns, and/or warranty defects are resolved between the customer and the vendor. The Company has no obligation for right of return and/or warranty for any of the sales completed using its website. Since we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we record our revenues as commissions earned on a net basis.  Our sales are net of promotional discounts and rebates and are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Revenues are recorded net of sales and consumption taxes. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as daily sweepstakes reward opportunities that is based on volume of purchases, and other similar offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in "Net revenues."  We record deferred revenue when cash is received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of goods. Deferred revenue is also recorded to account for the seven day grace period offered to customers for potential product disputes, if any. Deferred revenue was $0 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.  P2P platform Servicing fee income  Borrowers typically pay us a servicing fee on each payment received. The service fees compensate us for the costs we incur in servicing the related loan, including managing funding from investors, payments to investors and maintaining borrower' account portfolios. We record servicing fees paid by borrower as a component of operating revenue when received. Deferred revenue was $3,720,050 as of December 31, 2015.  Interest income on loans  Interest on loan receivables is accrued monthly in accordance with their contractual terms and recorded in accrued interest receivable. The Company does not charge prepayment penalty from customers.  Distribution Revenue Recognition  We record product sales and shipping revenues, net of return allowances, when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue, are estimated using historical experience. Revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales and consumption taxes.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  On April 1, 2014, the Company sold its entire 51% equity interest of Beijing Beitun Trading Co. Ltd. ("Beitun") to Yifan Zhang for $41,030 (RMB255,000). Yifan Zhang is the daughter of Ms. Wei Guo, the shareholder and managing director of Beitun. See "Note 21 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  We consider all investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily represent funds invested in bank checking accounts, money market funds and domestic Chinese bank certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no cash equivalents.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  The Company's financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, advance to suppliers, prepaid expenses, other receivables, other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, other payables, related party payables, convertible note, short term debt and derivative liabilities. These financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values. For fair value measurement, US GAAP establishes a three-tier hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:  Level 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  Level 2 include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.  Level 3 unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.  Fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, advance to suppliers, prepaid expenses, other receivables, other assets, account payable, accrued liabilities, other payables, convertible note and short term debt approximates their fair value due to their short-term maturities.  The Company's Level 3 valuation relates to derivative liabilities measured using management's estimates of fair value as well as other significant inputs, such as volatility and risk free interest rate, which may be unobservable. See Note 15.  The Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts presented in these financial statements using available market information and appropriate methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The estimates presented in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.  Management believes it is not practical to estimate the fair value of related party payables because the transactions cannot be assumed to have been consummated at arm's length, the terms are not deemed to be market terms, there are no quoted values available for these instruments, and an independent valuation would not be practical due to the lack of data regarding similar instruments, if any, and the associated potential costs.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, "Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity". The amendments in the ASU change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area. It also addresses sources of confusion and inconsistent application related to financial reporting of discontinued operations guidance in U.S. GAAP. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. In addition, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The amendments in the ASU are effective in the first quarter of 2015 for public organizations with calendar year ends. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets. This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchanged for those goods or services. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Accounting for Share-based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period". The guideline requires performance targets, which affect vesting and can be achieved after the requisite service period, to be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If achievement of the performance target becomes probable before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these changes to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern". The amendment in the ASU provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.  In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity". The amendments clarify how current US GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. Specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features, including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of the host contract. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. The amendments in this ASU also clarify that, in evaluating the nature of a host contract, an entity should assess the substance of the relevant terms and features (i.e., the relative strength of the debt-like or equity-like terms and features given the facts and circumstances) when considering how to weight those terms and features. Specifically, the assessment of the substance of the relevant terms and features should incorporate a consideration of: (1) the characteristics of the terms and features themselves (for example, contingent versus noncontingent, in-the-money versus out-of-the-money); (2) the circumstances under which the hybrid financial instrument was issued or acquired (e.g., issuer-specific characteristics, such as whether the issuer is thinly capitalized or profitable and well-capitalized); and (3) the potential outcomes of the hybrid financial instrument (e.g., the instrument may be settled by the issuer issuing a fixed number of shares, the instrument may be settled by the issuer transferring a specified amount of cash, or the instrument may remain legal-form equity), as well as the likelihood of those potential outcomes. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that are issuers of, or investors in, hybrid financial instruments that are issued in the form of a share. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.

 Competitive Advantages

Business-to-consumer ecommerce is just starting out in China—our website is one of the players in this space. Our unique incentive and sweepstake programs have distinguished us in this burgeoning sector by enriching the experiences of our merchants and customers. Merchant Benefits: 

Our incentive program constitutes a potent marketing mechanism for merchants as it enables them to set purchase price amounts. 
Merchants are awarded cash for every successful referral. 
China’s emergent middle-class is spreading throughout China—our website provides merchants with comprehensive retail channels and geographical breadth. 
Merchants have autonomy and flexibility in how they fulfill and ship goods to customers. 
Customer Benefits: 

Customers receive an indirect discount through incentive points based on their membership level and purchasing history with the merchant. 
Our sweepstakes program lets members participate in daily cash drawings. 
Our Benefits: 

These low cost programs effectively tap into the group-buying dynamic. 
Since the larger the volume of sales on a given day the greater the prize money, our customers are motivated to get their family and friends to become members of and make purchases through Consumer Capital’s website. 
Our business-to-consumer approach to ecommerce allows us to avoid the overhead and operational difficulties of supply chains. 
Our website is an effective mechanism in support of the government’s policies to boost consumption.

	EXPLANATORY
	NOTE





	 





	Consumer Capital Group, Inc. (the
	“Company”) is filing this Amendment No. 2 to its Comprehensive Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended
	December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 (“Amendment No. 2”) to amend the Comprehensive Annual Report which was
	originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 2, 2016 and subsequently amended
	on July 19, 2016 (collectively the “Annual Report”). The sole purpose of this Amendment No. 2 is to amend certain
	figures stated in the “Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income”, which was mistakenly stated
	as result of clerical errors. The revision of the figure does not materially impact other numbers stated in Company’s consolidated
	financial statements.





	 




	Pursuant
	to Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Amendment No.2 also contains
	new certifications pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Accordingly, Amendment No.2 includes the
	currently dated certifications as exhibits.




	 




	Except
	as described above, no attempt has been made in this Amendment No. 2 to modify or update the other disclosures in the Annual Report.
	Amendment No. 2 continues to speak as of the date of the Annual Report, and the Company has not updated the disclosures contained
	therein to reflect any events which occurred at a date subsequent to the filing of the Annual Report. Accordingly, Amendment No. 2
	should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	 



	Board
	of Directors and Stockholders of

	Consumer Capital Group, Inc



	 



	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consumer Capital Group, Inc (the “Company”) as of December
	31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in owners’ equity
	and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
	management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.



	 



	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
	are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of their internal
	control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
	designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
	also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements,
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
	statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.



	 



	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
	of Consumer Capital Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
	years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	DECEMBER 31, 2015 and DECEMBER 31, 2014




	 



	NOTE
	1 — ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 



	ORGANIZATION



	 



	Consumer
	Capital Group, Inc. (“CCG” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 2008. The accompanying
	consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and an affiliated
	PRC entity (“Affiliated PRC Entity”) that is controlled through contractual arrangements. On February 5, 2010, in
	connection with the execution of a Stock Right Transfer Agreement, America Pine Group Inc. transferred both 100% of the stock
	rights of its wholly owned subsidiary Arki (Beijing) E-commerce Technology Co., Ltd. and 100% of its stock rights of America Pine
	(Beijing) Bio-Tech to Consumer Capital Group, Inc., a California corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“CCG
	California”).



	 



	On
	February 4, 2011, pursuant to a Plan and Agreement of Merger by and among Mondas Minerals Corp., its wholly owned subsidiary,
	CCG Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“CCG Delaware”), CCG California, and Scott D. Bengfort, Mondas Minerals
	Corp. merged its wholly-owned subsidiary CCG Delaware into CCG California, with CCG California surviving and CCG Delaware ceasing
	to exist. On February 7, 2011, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary by the name of “Consumer Capital Group Inc.”
	(“CCG Name Sub”) in Delaware solely for purposes of changing its corporate name to “Consumer Capital Group Inc.”
	in conjunction with the closing of the Merger. On February 17, 2011, the Company changed its name to Consumer Capital Group Inc.
	pursuant to a Certificate of Ownership filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware by merging CCG Name Sub into the Company
	with the Company surviving and CCG Name Sub ceasing to exist. Unless the context specifies otherwise, references to the “Company”
	refers to CCG California prior to the Merger and the Company, its subsidiaries and Affiliated PRC Entity combined after the Merger.
	The Company is principally engaged in the development and operation of its nationwide online retailing platform “Chinese
	Consumer Market Network” at

	www.ccmus.com,

	which provides a variety of manufacturers and distributors a platform
	to promote and sell products and services directly to consumers. The Company’s principal operations and geographic markets
	are in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).



	 



	Post
	Merger, Consumer Capital Group Inc. is authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share.
	On February 4, 2011, Consumer Capital Group Inc. effected a reverse stock split (the “Stock Split”), as a result of
	which each 21.96 shares of Consumer Capital Group’s common stock then issued and outstanding was converted into one share
	of Mondas Minerals’ common stock.



	 



	Immediately
	prior to the Merger, Consumer Capital Group, Inc. had 390,444,109 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding. In connection
	with the Merger, Mondas Minerals issued 17,777,778 shares of its common stock in exchange for the issued and outstanding shares
	of common stock of CCG California. Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, there were 2,500,000 issued and outstanding
	shares of the Company’s common stock, 60% of which were held by the then-principal stockholder, CEO, and sole director of
	the Company, Mr. Bengfort. As a part of the Merger, CCG paid $335,000 in cash to Mr. Bengfort in exchange for his agreement to
	enter into various transaction agreements relating to the Merger, as well as the cancellation of 1,388,889 shares of the Company’s
	common stock directly held by him, constituting 92.6% of his pre-Merger holdings of Company common stock.



	 



	DEBIT
	CARD PROGRAM



	 



	The
	Company cooperates with a Chinese bank named Fuxin bank to issue cobranded debit cards. Retail store vendors throughout China
	are signed up to the Company’s debit card program. The Company charges each participating vendor a percentage of transactions
	with that vendor. Each vendor will receive a percentage of future transactions of the cards issued by the vendor. Cardholders
	will receive certain amounts of cash refund from participating vendors and earn points to be spent on

	www.ccmus.com

	. For
	the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, no revenue from this business model has been realized or booked as other income. Such
	operation has been ceased in 2015 subsequently.



	 



	BEITUN



	 



	The
	Company owned a 51% majority interest in an operating subsidiary, Beijing Beitun Trading Co., Ltd. (“Beitun”). Beitun,
	a PRC trading and distribution company, engages in the wholesale distribution of various food and meat products. It was established
	on April 24, 2000 and operates in the PRC. Its customers consist of retail restaurants and food producers located through the
	PRC.



	 



	On
	April 1, 2014, the Company disposed of its entire 51% equity interest in Beitun.

	SHANGHAI
	ZHONGHUI



	 



	On
	December 23, 2014, the Company and Shanghai Zhonghui Financial Information Services Corp., a company established under the laws
	of People’s Republic of China, entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which
	the Company agreed to acquire 51% of the capital stock of Shanghai Zhonghui (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the term
	of the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share
	(the “Common Stock”), to certain individuals affiliated with Shanghai Zhonghui (the “Affiliates”), valued
	at $1.00 per share for a total of $5,000,000 or approximately 31,000,000 RMB, to exchange 51% of the capital stock of Shanghai
	Zhonghui. As incentive for the closing of the Acquisition, the Company also agreed to issue to the Affiliates 5,000,000 additional
	shares of the Common Stock.



	 



	Established
	on May 26, 2014, under the PRC laws, Shanghai Zhonghui offers financing and investment opportunities for small to medium sized
	business and investors, including outsource of financial information technologies, investment management, investment consulting,
	as well as other related asset management services in China.

	In
	order to comply with the PRC law and regulations which prohibit foreign control of companies involved in internet content, the
	Company operates its website using the licenses and permits held by Arki Network Service, a 100% PRC owned entity. The equity
	interests of Arki Network Service are legally held directly by Mr. Jianmin Gao and Mr. Fei Gao, shareholders and directors of
	the Company. The effective control of Arki Network Service is held by Arki Beijing and Arki Fuxin through a series of contractual
	arrangements (the “Contractual Agreements”). As a result of the Contractual Agreements, Arki Beijing and Arki Fuxin
	maintain the ability to control Arki Network Service, and are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits from Arki
	Network Service and are obligated to absorb all of Arki Network Service’ expected losses. Therefore, the Company consolidates
	Arki Network Service in accordance with SEC Regulation SX-3A-02 and Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810,
	Consolidation.

	Mr. Fei Gao, collectively, for their capital contributions to Arki Network Service, as required by the PRC. The term of the loan
	is for ten years from the date of execution until the date when Arki Fuxin requests repayment. Arki Fuxin may request repayment
	of the loan with 30 days advance notice. The loan is not repayable at the discretion of the shareholders and is eliminated upon
	consolidation.

	Service. The purchase price will be set off against the loan repayment under the loan agreement. Arki Fuxin may exercise such
	option at any time until it has acquired all equity interests of Arki Network Service or freely transferred the option to any
	third party and such third party assumes the rights and obligations of the option agreement.

	from the performance of this agreement. This agreement has a term of ten years from the effective date and can only be terminated

	transfer or assign the shares or the rights and obligations in the share pledge agreement or create or permit any pledges which
	may have an adverse effect on the rights or benefits of Arki Fuxin without Arki Fuxin’s preapproval. Arki Fuxin is entitled
	to transfer or assign in full or in part the shares pledged. In the event of default, Arki Fuxin as the pledge, will be entitled

	NOTE
	2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	RECLASSIFICATIONS



	 



	Certain
	prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact
	on net earnings and financial position.



	 



	PRINCIPLES
	OF CONSOLIDATION



	 



	The
	consolidated financial statements of 2015 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries based in the PRC,
	which include America Pine Beijing, Arki Beijing, Arki Fuxin, 50.82% majority ownership in Shanghai Zhonghui, and 51% majority
	ownership in Arki Tianjin. The consolidated financial statements of 2014 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
	subsidiaries based in the PRC, which include America Pine Beijing, Arki Beijing, and Arki Fuxin, and 51% majority ownership in
	Beitun, prior to April 1, 2014, the disposal date. As a result of contractual arrangements with Arki Network Service, the Company
	consolidates Arki Network Service in accordance with SEC Regulation SX-3A-02 and Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	810, Consolidation. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.



	 



	USE
	OF ESTIMATES



	 



	The
	preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates.



	 



	FOREIGN
	CURRENCY TRANSLATION



	 



	The
	Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The Company’s functional currency is the local currency in the PRC,
	the Chinese Yuan (RMB). The financial statements of the Company are translated into United States dollars in accordance with ASC
	830, Foreign Currency Matters, using year-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for
	the period for revenues, costs, and expenses and historical rates for equity. Translation adjustments resulting from the process
	of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in determining comprehensive income. As
	of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the cumulative translation adjustment of $(44,436) and $131,528, respectively, was
	classified as an item accumulated of other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity (deficit) section of the consolidated
	balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the foreign currency translation adjustment to accumulated other
	comprehensive income (deficit) was $(191,030) and $68,198, respectively.



	 



	In
	accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the Company translated the assets and liabilities into US $ using the rate
	of exchange prevailing at the applicable balance sheet date and the statements of income and cash flows are translated at an average
	rate during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded in investors’ equity as part of
	accumulated other comprehensive income.

	REVENUE
	RECOGNITION



	 



	We
	recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable,
	and collectability is reasonably assured.



	 



	E-commerce
	Revenue Recognition



	 



	We
	evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the net amount of sales earned as commissions. We are not the primary obligor nor
	are we subject to inventory risk as the agreements with our suppliers specify that they have the responsibility to provide the
	product or service to the customer. Also, the amounts we earn from our vendors/suppliers is based on a fixed percentage and bound
	contractually. Additionally, the Company does not have any obligation to resolve disputes between the vendors and the customers
	that purchase the products on our website. Any disputes involving damaged, non-functional, product returns, and/or warranty defects
	are resolved between the customer and the vendor. The Company has no obligation for right of return and/or warranty for any of
	the sales completed using its website. Since we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage,
	a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we record our revenues as commissions earned on a net basis.



	 



	Our
	sales are net of promotional discounts and rebates and are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers.
	Revenues are recorded net of sales and consumption taxes. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage
	purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers,
	such as daily sweepstakes reward opportunities that is based on volume of purchases, and other similar offers. Current discount
	offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in “Net revenues.”



	 



	We
	record deferred revenue when cash is received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of goods. Deferred revenue
	is also recorded to account for the seven day grace period offered to customers for potential product disputes, if any. Deferred
	revenue was $0 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.



	 



	Servicing
	fee income



	 



	Borrowers
	typically pay us a servicing fee on each payment received. The service fees compensate us for the costs we incur in servicing
	the related loan, including managing funding from investors, payments to investors and maintaining borrower’ account portfolios.
	We record servicing fees paid by borrower as a component of operating revenue when received. Deferred revenue was $3,720,050 as
	of December 31, 2015.



	 



	Interest
	income on loans



	 



	Interest
	on loan receivables is accrued monthly in accordance with their contractual terms and recorded in accrued interest receivable.
	The Company does not charge prepayment penalty from customers.



	 



	DISCONTINUED
	OPERATIONS



	 



	On
	April 1, 2014, the Company sold its entire 51% equity interest of Beijing Beitun Trading Co. Ltd. (“Beitun”) to Yifan
	Zhang for $41,030 (RMB255,000). Yifan Zhang is the daughter of Ms. Wei Guo, the shareholder and managing director of Beitun. See
	Note 21 — Discounted Operations for additional information.



	 



	REWARD
	PROGRAMS



	 



	Reward
	Programs are limited to customers residing in China. Customers may earn reward points from the purchase of merchandise and services
	from the Company. Points are earned based on the amount and types of merchandise and services purchased. Customers residing in
	China may redeem the reward points for drawings into our daily “Lucky Drawing” sweepstakes for chances to win cash
	prizes or used for other promotion programs conducted by vendors. In addition, customers may attain a tiered membership status
	based on the value of merchandise and services purchased over the past twelve months. Membership status entitles the holder to
	certain discounts on future purchases of selected items on our website. We accrue for the estimated cost of redeeming the benefits
	at the time the benefits are earned by the customer. These benefit expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were
	$0, respectively, and recorded as selling expense.

	NON-CONTROLLING
	INTEREST



	 



	Noncontrolling
	interests in our subsidiary is recorded as a component of our equity, separate from the parent’s equity. Purchase or sales
	of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Results of operations
	attributable to the noncontrolling interest are included in our consolidated results of operations and, upon loss of control,
	the interest sold, as well as interest retained, if any, will be reported at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.



	 



	COMPREHENSIVE
	INCOME (LOSS)



	 



	Comprehensive
	income (loss) is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions
	to owners. Among other disclosures, Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 220, Comprehensive Income, requires that all items
	that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial
	statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. For the years presented, the Company’s
	comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the consolidated
	statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).



	 



	INCOME
	TAXES



	 



	Provisions
	for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported earnings before income taxes based on current tax law
	and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining
	deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items
	of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.
	Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.



	 



	The
	accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement
	of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized
	and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent
	that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination
	is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense.



	 



	We
	have implemented certain provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure
	for uncertainty in tax positions, as defined. ASC 740 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects
	of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. We adopted the provisions of ASC 740 as of January
	1, 2007, and have analyzed filing positions in each of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) jurisdictions
	where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. We have identified the
	PRC as our “major” tax jurisdiction. Generally, we remain subject to PRC examination of our income tax returns annually.
	We believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments
	that will result in a material change to our financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have
	been recorded pursuant to ASC 740. In addition, we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC
	740. Our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with income-based tax audits is to record such items as a component
	of income taxes. Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate based
	on rates established within the PRC and, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period.
	Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative
	adjustment. Income taxes payable as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $570,425.19 and $Nil, respectively.



	 








	 


	F-

	EARNINGS
	(LOSS) PER SHARE



	 



	We
	calculate basic earnings (loss) per share by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
	for the period, without considering common stock equivalents. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
	average number of common shares outstanding for the period and the weighted average number of dilutive common stock equivalents,
	such as options and warrants. Options and warrants are only included in the calculation of diluted EPS when their effect is not
	anti-dilutive. The Company had no dilutive securities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015
	and 2014, basic and diluted income(loss) per share were the same due to the Company’s loss position.



	 



	CASH
	AND CASH EQUIVALENTS



	 



	We
	consider all investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily
	represent funds invested in bank checking accounts, money market funds and domestic Chinese bank certificates of deposit. At December
	31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no cash equivalents.



	 



	LOAN
	RECEIVABLE



	 



	Loan
	receivable primarily represents the principle of loan lent to the borrowers. Management regularly reviews aging of loan receivables
	and changes in payment trends and records allowance when management believes collection of amounts due are at risk. Loan receivables
	considered uncollectible are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection.



	 



	ALLOWANCE
	FOR LOAN LOSSES



	 



	The
	allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated.
	Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Company’s past
	loan loss history, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability
	to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and
	other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to
	significant revision as more information becomes available.



	 



	The
	Company calculates the provision amount as below:



	 







	1.




	General
	Reserve — is based on total loan receivable balance and to be used to cover unidentified
	probable loan loss. The General Reserve is required to be no less than 1% of total loan
	receivable balance.





	 


	 


	 









	2.




	Special
	Reserve — is fund set aside covering losses due to risks related to a particular
	country, region, industry, borrower or type of loans. The reserve rate could be decided
	based on management estimate of loan collectability.





	 



	INTEREST
	RECEIVABLE



	 



	Interest
	receivable represents the amount of interest that has been earned as of the balance sheet date, but which has not yet been received
	in cash. Management regularly reviews aging of interest receivables and changes in payment trends and records allowance when management
	believes collection of amounts due are at risk. Interest receivable considered uncollectible are written off after exhaustive
	efforts at collection.



	 



	DEFERRED
	COST



	 



	Deferred
	cost represents the deferred service charge paid or payable to a related party which is calculated based on the service fee the
	Company received.



	 








	 


	F-

	15



	 







	 




	 



	LOANS
	FROM INDIVIDUALS



	 



	Loans
	from individuals primarily represent the principle of lending funds received from the individuals through the Company’s
	internet platform. The interest rates of such loans ranged from 11% to 17.5% per annum with a term lasting from 3 months to 12
	months.



	 



	PROPERTY
	AND EQUIPMENT, NET



	 



	Property
	and equipment is recorded at cost and consists of computer equipment, office equipment and furniture and is depreciated using
	the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets (generally three years or less). Costs incurred
	for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and expenditures for major replacements and improvements are capitalized
	and depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives.



	 



	IMPAIRMENT
	OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS



	 



	We
	evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to
	market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate their net book value may not be recoverable. When these
	events occur, we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over
	their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying
	amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded
	in the period in which the determination is made. The Company’s management currently believes there is no impairment of
	its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company’s
	products will continue. Either of these could result in the future impairment of long-lived assets.



	 



	SEGMENT
	REPORTING



	 



	The
	Company follows ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, who has been identified as the
	executive chairman of the board of directors and the chief executive officer, reviews the individual results of the e-commerce
	and distribution businesses when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing the performance of the Company as a
	whole and hence, the Company has two reportable segments before the disposition of the Company’s distribution business.
	The Company’s operating businesses are organized and based on the nature of markets and customers. As the Company’s
	long-lived assets are substantially all located in the PRC and substantially all the Company’s revenues are derived from
	within the PRC, no geographical segments are presented.



	 



	FAIR
	VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



	 



	The
	Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, advance to suppliers, prepaid expenses,
	other receivables, other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, other payables, related party payables, convertible note,
	short term debt and derivative liabilities. These financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values. For fair
	value measurement, US GAAP establishes a three-tier hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies
	in measuring fair value:



	 



	Level
	1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.



	 



	Level
	2 include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.



	 



	Level
	3 unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.



	 



	Fair
	value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
	measuring fair value.



	 



	The
	carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, advance to suppliers, prepaid expenses, other receivables, other
	assets, account payable, accrued liabilities, other payables, convertible note and short term debt approximates their fair value
	due to their short-term maturities.

	The
	Company’s Level 3 valuation relates to derivative liabilities measured using management’s estimates of fair value
	as well as other significant inputs, such as volatility and risk free interest rate, which may be unobservable. See Note 15.



	 



	The
	Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts presented in these financial statements using available market information
	and appropriate methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates
	of fair value. The estimates presented in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be
	realized in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material
	effect on the estimated fair value amounts.



	 



	Management
	believes it is not practical to estimate the fair value of related party payables because the transactions cannot be assumed to
	have been consummated at arm’s length, the terms are not deemed to be market terms, there are no quoted values available
	for these instruments, and an independent valuation would not be practical due to the lack of data regarding similar instruments,
	if any, and the associated potential costs.



	 



	SHARE-BASED
	COMPENSATION



	 



	We
	apply ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees to account for our service providers’ share-based payments. We
	gave Common stock of to service providers to retain their assistance in becoming a U.S. public company, assistance with public
	company regulations, investors’ communications and public relations with broker-dealers, market makers and other investment
	professionals. The cost of the equity based payments is recognized ratably over the service period. We have elected to recognize
	compensation expense using the straight-line method for all equity awards granted with graded vesting based on service conditions.
	Share-based compensation expenses amounted to $0 for the both years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.



	 



	DERIVATIVE
	LIABILITIES



	 



	Fair
	value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments, such as ratchet provisions or conversion features in
	convertible debt or equity instruments, and measurement of their fair value. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company
	uses the Black-Scholes pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible
	debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement.
	If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments
	as derivative financial instruments.



	 



	Once
	derivative liabilities are determined, they are adjusted to reflect fair value at the end of each reporting period. Any increase
	or decrease in the fair value is recorded in results of operations as a change in fair value of derivatives. In addition, the
	fair value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants, are also valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model.



	 



	DEBT
	DISCOUNT



	 



	The
	Company records debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt. These costs are amortized to interest
	expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts
	is immediately expensed.



	 



	CONCENTRATION
	OF CREDIT RISK



	 



	Assets
	that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents,
	and accounts receivable. The maximum exposure of such assets to credit risk is their carrying amounts as of the balance sheet
	dates. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were deposited in
	financial institutions located in the PRC, which management believes are of high credit quality. Management believes the credit
	risk on bank deposits is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating
	agencies, or state-owned banks in China. Cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with state-owned
	banks within the PRC and the United States of America. Balances at financial institutions or state owned banks within the PRC
	are not covered by insurance. Non-performance by these institutions could expose the Company to losses for amounts in excess of
	insured balances. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our bank balances with the banks in U.S. exceeded the insured amount by $119,569
	and $7,937, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our bank balances with the Banks in the PRC amounted to $641,229 and
	$32,792, respectively, which are uninsured and subject to credit risk. We have not experienced nonperformance by these institutions.



	 








	 


	F-

	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
	loan receivable from borrowers and the related accrued interest receivable. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has one significant
	borrower, which accounted for 92% of total loan receivable balance. The aforementioned borrower paid service fee and interest
	regularly according to the contract during the reporting period, and the Company believed that the default risk from this borrower
	is low in the foreseeable future.



	 



	CURRENCY
	CONVERTIBILITY RISK



	 



	We
	transact all of our business in RMB, which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. On January 1, 1994, the PRC government
	abolished the dual rate system and introduced a single rate of exchange as quoted daily by the People’s Bank of China (the
	“PBOC”). However, the unification of the exchange rates does not imply that the RMB may be readily convertible into
	U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions continue to take place either through the PBOC or
	other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the PBOC.



	 



	Approval
	of foreign currency payments by the PBOC or other institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers’
	invoices, shipping documents and signed contracts.



	 



	Additionally,
	the value of the RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and international economic and political developments
	affecting supply and demand in the PRC foreign exchange trading system market.



	 



	FOREIGN
	CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK



	 



	From
	July 21, 2005, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies.
	While the international reaction to the RMB appreciation has generally been positive, there remains significant international
	pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant
	appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar.



	 



	BUSINESS
	RISK



	 



	Foreign
	ownership of Internet-based businesses is subject to significant restrictions under current PRC laws and regulations. Foreign
	investors are not allowed to own more than a 50% equity interest in any entity with an Internet content distribution business.
	Currently, the Company conducts its operations in China through a series of contractual arrangements entered into among Arki (Beijing)
	E-Commerce Technology Corp., America Arki (Fuxin) Network Management Co. Ltd. and America Arki Network Service Beijing Co., Ltd.
	The relevant regulatory authorities may find the current ownership structure, contractual arrangements and businesses to be in
	violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations. If so, the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion
	in dealing with such violations.



	 



	LITIGATION



	 



	From
	time to time, we may become involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions. We estimate the range of liability related
	to any pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the
	loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the
	range, we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following
	conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that
	an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss
	can be reasonably estimated.

	RELATED
	PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	 



	A
	related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of the Company’s securities including such person’s
	immediate families, (ii) the Company’s management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by
	or is under common control with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions
	of the Company. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations
	between related parties.



	 



	NOTE
	3 — RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



	 



	In
	April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, “

	Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment
	(Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity

	”. The amendments
	in the ASU change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area. It also addresses
	sources of confusion and inconsistent application related to financial reporting of discontinued operations guidance in U.S. GAAP.
	Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations.
	In addition, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement
	users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The amendments in
	the ASU are effective in the first quarter of 2015 for public organizations with calendar year ends. Early adoption is permitted.
	The Company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.



	 



	In
	May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

	”. This ASU affects
	any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer
	of non-financial assets. This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most
	industry-specific guidance. The ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type
	and Production-Type Contracts. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
	of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
	in exchanged for those goods or services. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
	2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact
	of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.



	 



	In
	June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, “

	Accounting for Share-based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide that
	a Performance Target Could be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period

	”. The guideline requires performance targets,
	which affect vesting and can be achieved after the requisite service period, to be treated as a performance condition. As such,
	the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should
	be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the
	compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If achievement of the
	performance target becomes probable before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost
	should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The amendments are effective for interim and annual
	periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new
	standard on its consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these changes to have a material impact on the
	Company’s consolidated financial statements.



	 



	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “

	Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as
	a Going Concern

	”. The amendment in the ASU provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties
	in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s
	ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide
	certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
	The amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after
	December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its
	consolidated financial statements.

	In
	November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16, “

	Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract
	in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity

	”. The amendments clarify
	how current US GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid
	financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. Specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider
	all relevant terms and features, including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the
	nature of the host contract. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the
	economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics
	and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. The amendments in this ASU also clarify that, in evaluating the nature of
	a host contract, an entity should assess the substance of the relevant terms and features (i.e., the relative strength of the
	debt-like or equity-like terms and features given the facts and circumstances) when considering how to weight those terms and
	features. Specifically, the assessment of the substance of the relevant terms and features should incorporate a consideration
	of: (1) the characteristics of the terms and features themselves (for example, contingent versus noncontingent, in-the-money versus
	out-of-the-money); (2) the circumstances under which the hybrid financial instrument was issued or acquired (e.g., issuer-specific
	characteristics, such as whether the issuer is thinly capitalized or profitable and well-capitalized); and (3) the potential outcomes
	of the hybrid financial instrument (e.g., the instrument may be settled by the issuer issuing a fixed number of shares, the instrument
	may be settled by the issuer transferring a specified amount of cash, or the instrument may remain legal-form equity), as well
	as the likelihood of those potential outcomes. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that are issuers of, or investors
	in, hybrid financial instruments that are issued in the form of a share. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business
	entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. For all other entities,
	the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior
	periods. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.



	 



	In
	February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, “Consolidation

	(Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

	”.
	The amendments in this Update affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain
	legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. Specifically, the amendments:
	1. Modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting
	interest entities. 2. Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. 3. Affect the
	consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related
	party relationships. 4. Provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities
	that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment
	Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. The ASU will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
	adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

	NOTE
	7 — ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES



	 



	The
	allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated.
	Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Company’s past
	loan loss history, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability
	to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and
	other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to
	significant revision as more information becomes available.



	 



	The
	allowance is calculated at portfolio-level since our loans portfolio is typically of smaller balance homogenous loans and is collectively
	evaluated for impairment.



	 



	The
	allowance consists of the combination of a quantitative assessment component based on statistical models, a retrospective evaluation
	of actual loss information to loss forecasts, value of collaterals and could include a qualitative component based on management
	judgment.



	 



	Finally,
	as appropriate, the Company also considers individual borrower circumstances and the condition and fair value of the loan collateral,
	if any.

	In
	addition, the Company also calculates the provision amount as below:



	 




	General reserve


	 


	1% on total loan amounts at the end of year




	Specific reserve


	 


	5% on specific loan amounts at the end of year




	 



	While
	management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary
	based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance.



	 



	The

	NOTE
	8 — LOAN IMPAIRMENT



	 



	A
	loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect
	the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered
	by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal
	and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified
	as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into
	consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for
	the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest
	owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for corporate and personal loans by either the present value of expected
	future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
	dependent.



	 



	An
	allowance for loan losses is established for an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Currently,
	estimated fair values of substantially all of the Company’s impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value
	of the loan’s collateral which approximates to the carrying value due to the short term nature of the loans.



	 



	Loans
	with modified terms are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the Company grants such borrowers concessions and it is
	deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally
	involve a temporary below market rate reduction in interest rate or an extension of a loan’s stated maturity date. Non-accrual
	troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments, under the modified terms, are
	current for six consecutive months after modification. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired.



	 



	Even
	though the Company allows a one-time loan extension with a period up to the original loan period, which is usually twelve months.
	The principal of the loan remains the same and the interest rate is fixed at the current interest rate at the time of extension.
	Therefore, there were no troubled debt restructurings during the year ended December 31, 2015.

	NOTE
	14 — CONVERTIBLE NOTES



	 



	On
	June 14, 2013, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Asher Enterprises, Inc. (“Asher Enterprises”)
	pursuant to which the Company sold and issued to Asher Enterprises a promissory note with a principal amount of $78,500 (the “Asher
	Note 1”). The cash proceeds of the promissory note were received on July 9, 2013.



	 



	The
	Asher Note 1 matured on April 10, 2014 and compounds annually and accrues at 8% per annum from the issue date through the maturity
	date or upon acceleration or prepayment. The holder is entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid amount at
	any time on or after 180 days following the issuance date into the Company’s common stock, par value, $0.0001 per share,
	at an initial conversation price equal to 61% of the average of the three (3) lowest closing bid price for the Company’s
	common stock, during the ten (10) trading days ending on the latest trading day prior to the date a conversion notice delivered
	to the Company by the holder. The Note is not convertible by the holder if upon the conversion the holder and its affiliates would
	own in excess of 9.99% of our outstanding common stock.



	 



	On
	October 14, 2013, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Asher Enterprises pursuant to which the Company
	sold and issued to Asher Enterprises a promissory note with a principal amount of $42,500 (the “Asher Note 2”). The
	cash proceeds of the promissory note were received on November 14, 2013.



	 



	The
	Asher Note 2 matured on July 16, 2014 and compounds annually and accrues at 8% per annum from the issue date through the maturity
	date or upon acceleration or prepayment. The holder is entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid amount at
	any time on or after 180 days following the issuance date into the Company’s common stock, par value, $0.0001 per share,
	at an initial conversation price equal to 58% of the average of the three (3) lowest closing bid price for the Company’s

	to the Company by the holder. The Note is not convertible by the holder if upon the conversion the holder and its affiliates would
	own in excess of 9.99% of our outstanding common stock.



	 



	According
	to the agreements, upon default and the receipt of default notice from the debt holder, each note shall become immediately payable
	for an amount which is the greater of 1) 150% times the sum of the then outstanding principal amount of the note, plus accrued
	and unpaid interest on the unpaid amount to the date of payment, plus default interest or 2) the “parity value” of
	the default sum to be paid, where parity value means (a) the highest number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
	treating the trading day immediately preceding the payment date as the conversion date, multiplied by (b) the highest closing
	price for the common stock during the period beginning on the date of first occurrence of the event of default and the ending
	one day prior to the payment.

	The
	Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15 “

	Derivatives and Hedging

	”
	and determined that the instrument should be classified as liabilities once the conversion option becomes effective after 180
	days of debt issuance debt due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the
	above conversion options.



	 



	On
	January 10, 2014, Asher Note 1 of $78,500 became convertible. On the same day, Asher Enterprises converted $15,000 of convertible
	loan Asher Note 1 into 4,098 shares of common stock at conversion price of $3.66 per share. On August 28, 2014, Asher Enterprises
	converted $12,000 of convertible loan Asher Note 1 into 12,942 shares of common stock at conversion price of $0.93 per share.
	On October 1, 2014, Asher Enterprises converted $2,000 of convertible loan Asher Note 1 into 32,468 shares of common stock at
	conversion price of $0.06 per share. On October 15, 2014, Asher Enterprises converted $15,000 of convertible loan Asher Note 1
	into 72,886 shares of common stock at conversion price of $0.21 per share. On October 20, 2014, Asher Enterprises converted $15,000
	of convertible loan Asher Note 1 into 43,103 shares of common stock at conversion price of $0.35 per share. On November 19, 2014,
	Asher Enterprises converted $15,000 of convertible loan Asher Note 1 into 59,976 shares of common stock at conversion price of
	$0.25 per share. On December 9, 2014, Asher Enterprises converted the remaining $14,500 of convertible loan Asher Note 1 into
	81,967 shares of common stock at conversion price of $0.18 per share. The interest payable related to Asher Note 1 for an amount
	of $3,140 was also converted into 17,750 shares of common stock at conversion price of $0.18 on the same day.



	 



	On
	May 5, 2014, Asher Note 2 of $42,500 became convertible. Asher Enterprises converted the convertible note in full amount in 2015.
	See Note 22.



	 



	The
	Company has received the default notices for both notes on November 12, 2014 (the “Default Date”). Upon the
	receipt of default notice, the Company was subject to default term from the date of default and all the default interest will
	be subject to conversion at the debt holder’s request. The Company recognized a loss on debt default of $31,250 on the
	Default Date.



	 



	As
	described in Note 15, the embedded conversion feature qualified for liability classification at fair value. As a result, the
	Company recorded debt discounts of $30,991 to Asher Note 1 and $42,500 to Asher Note 2 at the dates the notes became
	convertible. In connection with the default of Asher Note 1 and 2, the increased principal of the two notes also contained
	embedded conversion feature. Accordingly, a debt discount of $31,250 was recorded on the Default Date. The initial carrying
	value of the Convertible Debt is accreted to its stated amount on maturity using the effective interest method. Amortization
	of the discount was recorded as a component of interest expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive income.
	Amortization of debt discount amounted to $104,741 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
	Contractual interest expense for the two Asher convertible notes amounted to $6,540 and $4,168 for the year ended December
	31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.



	 



	The
	Company recorded debt discount relating to its derivative debt to the extent of gross proceeds raised in its debt financing transactions,
	and immediately expensed the remaining value of the derivative if it exceeded the gross proceeds of the note. The Company recorded
	a derivative expense of $117,006 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The derivative expense was
	included in change in fair value of derivative liabilities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.



	 



	As
	of December 31, 2014, the principal and interest of Asher Note 1 have been fully converted into 325,190 common shares of the Company.
	The balance of Asher Note 2 was $63,750 as of December 31, 2014 based on the effective interest method and was fully converted
	into the Company’s common stock subsequent to December 31, 2014.



	 



	During
	the period from February 25, 2015 to March 11, 2015, Asher Enterprises fully converted $63,750 of Asher Note 2 and associated
	interest of $3,400 into 414,361 shares of common stock at conversion price in the range from $0.1334 to $0.2127 per share.

	NOTE
	15 — DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



	 



	The
	Company issued convertible notes with certain reset provisions (See Note 14). The Company accounted for the reset provisions in
	accordance with ASC 815-40, which requires the Company to bifurcate the embedded conversion options as liability at the date the
	note becomes convertible and to record changes in fair value relating to the conversion option liability in the consolidated statements
	of comprehensive loss as of each subsequent balance sheet date. The debt discount related to the convertible note is amortized
	over the life of the note using the effective interest method.



	 



	The
	conversion option embedded in the convertible debt contains no explicit limit to the number of shares to be issued upon settlement
	and as a result is classified as a liability under ASC 815. The following table sets forth the Company’s consolidated financial
	assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31,
	2014. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of inputs that is significant to the fair

	The
	Company’s conversion option liabilities are valued using pricing models and the Company generally uses similar models to
	value similar instruments. Where possible, the Company verifies the values produced by its pricing models to market prices. Valuation
	models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit spreads, measures of volatility
	and correlations of such inputs. An active stock market did not exist until the second half year of 2014, and as such, it involved
	some management judgment when using pricing models. Such instruments are typically classified within Level 3 of the fair value
	hierarchy.



	 



	The
	table below shows the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model inputs used by the Company to value the derivative liability, as well
	as the determined value of the option derivative liability as of the measurement dates.

	Beginning
	January 1, 2008, the new Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) law has replaced the old laws for Domestic Enterprises (“DES”)
	and Foreign Invested Enterprises (“FIEs”). The new standard EIT rate of 25% replaces the 33% rate applicable to both
	DES and FIEs.



	 



	The
	new EIT Law also imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate
	holding company outside of China, if such immediate holding company is considered as a non-resident enterprise without any establishment
	or place within China or if the received dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate holding
	company within China, unless such immediate holding company’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China
	that provides for a different withholding arrangement. Such withholding income tax was exempted under the previous income tax
	regulations.

	Accounting
	for Uncertainty in Income Taxes



	 



	The
	Company adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes on January 1, 2007. The provisions clarify the
	accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with the
	standard “Accounting for Income Taxes,” and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for
	financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
	provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest
	and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.



	 



	The
	Company may from time to time be assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions. In the event it receives an assessment
	for interest and/or penalties, it will be classified in the financial statements as tax expense.



	 



	The
	PRC tax law provides a (3-5 years) statute of limitation and the Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination
	by tax authorities during that period. All penalties and interest are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2015
	and 2014, there were no penalties and interest.



	 



	Based
	on the Company’s evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition
	in its financial statements.

	20 — DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS



	 



	On
	April 1, 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell and transfer its entire 51% equity interests in Beitun.



	 



	Under
	the term of the agreement to dispose Beitun, the Company agreed to receive $41,030 (RMB 255,000) in cash consideration from
	Yifan Zhang for the sale of its 51% equity interest in Beitun. Yifan Zhang is the daughter of Ms. Wei Guo, the Shareholder
	and Managing Director of Beitun. As of December 31, 2014, the Company did not receive the cash payment from Yifan Zahng, and
	did not expect the proceeds in future. Therefore, it was expensed and recorded as part of “Loss on disposal of
	subsidiary”.



	 



	The
	results of operations of Beitun, for all periods, were separately reported as “discontinued operations”. The loss
	on disposal of Beitun totaled $47,871, which was reported as “Loss on disposal of subsidiary” for the year ended December
	31, 2014.

	NOTE
	21 — SUBSEQUENT EVENT



	 



	As
	of this report date, RMB 71.6 million loans to one of the Shanghai Zhonghui’s borrowers have been overdue. The

	Company
	is in the process of negotiating repayment arrangement with this borrower. Since all the overdue loans were secured by
	pledged of the operating assets of the borrower, of which the appraisal value is much higher than the amount of overdue
	loans, the Company believes that the current provision is sufficient.


	 



	Except
	the above, there were no events or transactions other than those disclosed in this report, if any, that would require recognition
	or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.
