DNP Select Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: DNP), our first  fund product, is a diversified, closed-end investment company that began  operations in January 1987.  The Fund has  a primary investment objective that focuses on current income and long-term  growth of income.  Capital appreciation is  a secondary objective.  The Fund invests  primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities of  companies within the global utilities industry.

Duff & Phelps Global Utility Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: DPG) is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company investing primarily in equities of domestic and foreign utilities that was initially  offered to the public in July 2011.  The  Fund’s investment objective is to seek total return, resulting primarily from (i) a high level of  current income, with an emphasis on providing tax-advantage dividend income,  and (ii) growth in current income, and secondarily from capital appreciation.
Duff & Phelps  Select Energy MLP Fund Inc. (NYSE: DSE) is a non-diversified, closed-end  management company that was organized in June, 2014.  The Fund’s investment objective is to seek a  high level of total return resulting from a combination of current tax-deferred  distributions and capital appreciation.   The Fund invests at least 80% of its managed assets in select energy  Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) which offer exposure to the ongoing energy  renaissance and the reshaping of the U.S. energy economy. 
 
Duff & Phelps Utility and Corporate Bond Trust Inc. (NYSE: DUC) is a diversified, closed-end investment company, first offered its  common stock to the public in January of 1993.   The primary investment objective is high current income  consistent with investing in fixed income securities of investment grade quality.  The Fund’s investment process is focused on  utility and corporate fixed income securities.

DTF Tax-Free Income Inc. (NYSE: DTF) is a  diversified, closed-end investment company that was organized in November,  1991.  This Fund’s investment objective  is current income that is exempt from regular U.S. federal income  tax consistent with the preservation of capital.  The Fund invests in a diversified  portfolio of investment-grade tax-exempt fixed income securities that are  issued by states, counties and municipalities within the United States.

History[edit]
1932–1992[edit]
Duff & Phelps was founded in 1932 to provide investment research. Since that time, the firm expanded into corporate finance and investment management as well as credit rating. In 1979, Duff & Phelps expanded into investment management (creating what would become Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co. (DPIMC), which was spun off into its own company in 2009 and is no longer a part of the Duff & Phelps Corporation).
In 1984, the company was nearly acquired by Security Pacific Corp. in a $35 million transaction. However, the deal was called off in early 1985 Security Pacific Corp. because of restraints put on the deal by the Federal Reserve Board, which would have precluded the company from issuing public credit ratings.[1][2][3]
The company was acquired five years later, in 1989, in a $146 million management buyout. The buyout was backed by Freeman, Spogli & Co., a private equity firm, which controlled approximately two-thirds of the company, and management and employees owning the remaining third of the company's equity. The transaction was highly leveraged, financed with 79% bank borrowings and 15% coupon high-yield bonds.[4] The company was taken public for the first time in 1992 through an initial public offering of stock on the New York Stock Exchange.[5]
Since 1993[edit]
By the mid-1990s, Duff & Phelps, which was operating as a publicly traded company, began to focus on its core investment management, financial advisory and corporate finance operations. As a result, in October 1994, the Duff & Phelps's credit rating business, Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co., was spun off to its shareholders and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[6] In 2000, Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. was acquired by Fitch Group, which later eliminated the use of the Duff & Phelps name.[7]
In 2004, Lovell Minnick Partners sponsored a management buyout of the company, the second time the company had undergone a leveraged buyout transaction, acquiring the company from its then owner, Webster Financial Corporation. As part of the transaction, the company was merged with Stone Ridge Partners, a middle-market investment banking firm.[8][9] In 2005, the company raised equity from Vestar Capital Partners to support the company's acquisition strategy that included the purchase of Standard & Poor's Corporate Value Consulting business as well as Valuemetrics, a financial advisory firm specializing in valuation services founded in 1981.[10]
In 2006, it acquired specialty restructuring firm Chanin Capital Partners, LLC.
In 2007, Duff & Phelps completed its second initial public offering raising $133 million and listing the company's shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The IPO provided a partial exit for its two private equity financial sponsors.[11][12] Also in 2007, the firm formed a strategic alliance with Tokyo-based Shinsei Bank. The firm has continued its acquisition strategy acquiring Dubinsky & Co., a financial consulting company and Kane Reece Associates.[13] In 2010, the firm acquired the consulting business of Dynamic Credit Partners, bringing specialized talent in complex fixed income securities analysis, valuation and litigation support. [1]
In 2007, Duff & Phelps acquired Rash & Associates, a nationwide provider of property tax management services, enhancing the firm’s property tax consulting business.
In 2009, Duff & Phelps acquired Lumin Expert Group, a financial consulting firm specializing in intellectual property dispute support and expert testimony.
In June 2010, Duff & Phelps announced it acquired Cole & Partners, a Toronto-based independent financial advisory practice. The acquisition established a Canadian presence for Duff & Phelps and enhanced the firm’s dispute consulting, valuation and corporate finance advisory services. In December, the firm acquired June Consulting Group, a Houston-based advisor to corporate legal departments on technical and operational issues.
In July 2011, Duff & Phelps announced it acquired Growth Capital Partners, a Texas-based investment banking firm focused on transactions in the middle market.
In October 2011, Duff & Phelps acquired MCR, a UK-based corporate restructuring and turnaround firm focused on insolvency administration and independent business reviews. The acquisition expanded Duff & Phelps' presence in Europe and enhanced the firm's Global Restructuring Advisory practice.
In December 2011, Duff & Phelps agreed to acquire Pagemill Partners, a Silicon Valley-based investment banking and valuation services firm. The acquisition enhanced Duff & Phelps’ Mergers and Acquisitions practice and further developed the firm’s technology industry expertise.
2012[edit]
Duff & Phelps were appointed Administrators to Rangers F.C., in February 2012, the largest football insolvency in the UK.
Following the negotiation of an agreement with the playing squad to sacrifice salaries to help the club, the Administrators completed a sale of the club to the Sevco Scotland Ltd which later renamed The Rangers Football Club Ltd, headed by Charles Green, on 14 June 2012.
In May 2012, Duff & Phelps acquired Harvester Forensics Limited, a leading investigative and advisory firm based in Toronto.
In October 2012, Duff & Phelps acquired Ceteris, a global economic consulting firm providing transfer pricing expertise along with strategic economic analysis and tax valuation services, and iEnvision Technology, an advisory firm that provides law firms and corporate legal departments with Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) solutions.
On December 30, 2012, Duff & Phelps, announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement under which a consortium, comprising controlled affiliates of or funds managed by The Carlyle Group, Stone Point Capital LLC, Pictet & Cie and Edmond de Rothschild Group.
2013[edit]
In April 2013, Duff & Phelps began a partnership with the consortium of financial sponsors and transitioned from a public to private entity.
2014[edit]
In July 2014, Duff & Phelps acquired the Restructuring and Insolvency Division of RSM Farrell Grant Sparks (“RSM FGS”), one of the largest dedicated restructuring and insolvency teams operating in the Republic of Ireland. The acquisition expanded Duff & Phelps’ Global Restructuring Advisory Practice to include more than 200 professionals across Europe, the U.S. and Canada.
2015[edit]
In 2015, Duff & Phelps made two significant acquisitions that significantly expanded the geographic footprint of the firm and broadened its service offering. The first was of Kinetic Partners, a UK-based financial regulatory consulting firm with 200 employees. As a result of this acquisition, Duff & Phelps launched its Financial Regulatory and Compliance practice.
The second acquisition was of American Appraisal, a Milwaukee-based valuation company with nearly 1,000 employees globally. This acquisition broadened the type of valuation work Duff & Phelps did in the U.S., specifically in fixed asset management and insurance solutions (FAMIS). In addition to the new locations in the U.S., the acquisition established new locations for the firm in Europe and Asia. The American Appraisal acquisition also included the Real Estate Advisory Group (REAG) business.
In December 2015, Duff & Phelps announced that the University of California’s Office of the Chief Investment Officer would make a significant minority investment in the firm. As part of the transaction, The Carlyle Group and Duff & Phelps’ senior management group increased its investment. Stonepoint Capital LLC, Edmond de Rothschild Group and Pictet Group sold their equity interest in Duff & Phelps.
2016[edit]
In January 2016, Duff & Phelps acquired CounselWorks, LLC, a provider of compliance and regulatory services to clients in the alternative asset management sector. CounselWorks joined the firm’s existing Compliance and Regulatory Consulting practice.
In April 2016, Duff & Phelps acquired Tregin Solutions, Inc, a legal management consulting firm that assists corporate legal departments and law firm with process, technology and strategy solutions. Tregin Solutions joined Duff & Phelps’ existing Legal Management Consulting practice.
In May 2016, Duff & Phelps acquired Corporate Finance Ireland (CFI), a leading corporate finance firm in the Republic of Ireland. The acquisition expanded Duff & Phelps' Irish business to include over 70 professionals specializing in restructuring, insolvency, M&A, compliance and regulatory consulting, fairness opinions, private capital raising and real estate advisory.

Vanguard bond funds


94% of our low-cost bond funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Find income and stability with bond funds
Get higher potential for income



Bond mutual funds give your portfolio the opportunity to earn income, unlike money market funds (which focus on protecting your cash) and stock funds (which aim for long-term growth).

Add stability to your portfolio



When included in a well-balanced portfolio, bond funds can help balance the risks associated with stock funds.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds in a single fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds.

Get broad exposure to the bond markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the bond portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of bonds in a single, diversified fund.






Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund holds more than 5,000 domestic investment-grade bonds.

Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund holds about 3,000 non-U.S. bonds.

How to choose a bond fund



There are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right bond fund for your portfolio:

Am I investing outside of an IRA or other retirement account?



If you're in one of the highest tax brackets and investing outside of your retirement account, you may be able to reduce your tax exposure with a tax-exempt bond fund.
Find out if tax-exempt mutual funds are right for you
Cut your federal tax bill with a national tax-exempt fund. Get added state-tax savings if you live in:

				California

				Massachusetts

				New Jersey

				New York

				Ohio

				Pennsylvania


See a list of Vanguard tax-exempt bond funds


Do I want domestic or international bonds?



Investing in both U.S. and international bond funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

How much risk am I comfortable with?



Knowing the general traits used to identify the different bonds within a bond fund can help you determine your overall tolerance for risk.

Average maturity. Bond funds come with short-, intermediate-, or long-term maturities. The longer the maturity, the more sensitive the fund is to changes in interest rates.

Credit quality. Bonds that are backed by the government or one of its agencies have the best "creditworthiness" and a lower chance of default than most corporate bonds. Corporate bonds with high credit quality are considered investment-grade bonds, and those below investment-grade are considered high-yield ("junk") bonds.



Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While this gives you the chance to beat the benchmark, any actively managed fund could just as easily miss the mark.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Do I want to keep pace with inflation?



Inflation-protected bond funds invest in government bonds and are routinely adjusted for inflation.

footnote*For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 51 of 54 Vanguard bond funds outperformed their Lipper peer-group averages. Results will vary for other time periods.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
	Bond funds are subject to interest rate risk, which is the chance bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates, and credit risk, which is the chance a bond issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Investments in bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk.
	Vanguard average stock fund expense ratio: 0.12%; industry average stock fund expense ratio: 0.69%. Vanguard average bond fund expense ratio: 0.09%; industry average bond fund expense ratio: 0.60%. Vanguard average money market fund expense ratio: 0.14%; industry average money market fund expense ratio: 0.30%. All averages are asset-weighted. Industry averages exclude Vanguard.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fund Overview
Duff & Phelps Utility and Corporate Bond Trust Inc. (the "Fund"), a diversified closed-end investment company, first offered its common stock to the public in January of 1993.
Investment objective
The Fund's investment objective is high current income consistent with investing in securities of investment grade quality. DUC utilizes a bank loan to leverage the common stockholders’ investment.
The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in a diversified portfolio of Income Securities. As used in the Fund's prospectus, Income Securities consist of Utility Income Securities, Corporate Income Securities, Mortgage-Backed Securities and Asset-Backed Securities (each as defined in the prospectus). In normal market conditions, at least 80% of the Fund's total assets will be invested, in the aggregate, in Utility and Corporate Bonds, and at least 25% of the Fund's total assets will be invested in Utility Income Securities.
Important Risk Considerations
Credit & Interest: Debt securities are subject to various risks, the most prominent of which are credit and interest rate risk. The issuer of a debt security may fail to make interest and/or principal payments. Values of debt securities may rise or fall in response to changes in interest rates, and this risk may be enhanced with longer-term maturities.
Industry/Sector Concentration: A fund that focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector will be more sensitive to conditions that affect that industry or sector than a non-concentrated fund.
Foreign Investing: Investing internationally involves additional risks such as currency, political, accounting, economic, and market risk.
No Guarantee: There is no guarantee that the portfolio will meet its objective.
Leverage: When a fund leverages its portfolio, the value of its shares may be more volatile and all other risks may be compounded.
This information does not represent an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell securities of the Fund.
1Net Asset Value vs. Market Price: Net Asset Value (NAV) represents the total value of all assets held by the Fund (minus its total liabilities), divided by the total number of common shares outstanding. The net asset value returns reflect the performance of the manager. Market price is the price at which investors may purchase or sell shares of the Fund. Market price is determined in the open market by buyers and sellers, based on supply and demand. The Fund’s Market Price fluctuates throughout the day and may differ from its underlying NAV. Shares of the Fund may trade at a premium (higher than) or a discount (lower than) to NAV. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the Fund’s net asset value could decline. The Fund has no control over the market price.    2Percentages based on total investments rather than total net assets.  The portfolio is actively managed and subject to change.
3The ratings issued by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations assess the credit worthiness of a corporation’s or government’s debt issues.  The ratings apply to the Fund’s holdings and not the Fund itself.  The lower rating of Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC is used.  If a particular security is rated by either Moody’s or S&P, but not both, then the single rating is used.  If a particular security is not rated by either Moody’s or S&P, a rating from Fitch Ratings Ltd. is used, if available.  Ratings are subject to change.  AAA, AA, A, and BBB are investment grade ratings; BB and below are below-investment grade ratings.
