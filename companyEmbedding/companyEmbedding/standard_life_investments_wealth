Our chargesShould your clients decide to allocate a proportion of their assets for Standard Life Wealth to manage, we want to make sure that you understand what services they’re paying for. We’re only too aware of the impact that costs can have on performance and believe that our simple charging structure differentiates us from many of our peers. We believe in clarity and transparency.
We apply our standard annual management fee on the value of your client’s portfolio. This is a clean fee and is charged quarterly, in arrears. There are no initial or exit fees.
Adviser charging
Standard Life Wealth will facilitate client agreed adviser charging arrangements.

Governance

Our team



Our team
As one of the largest institutional investors in the UK, it’s only fitting we should have dedicated governance and stewardship teams to focus on developing and implementing a professional approach to the field.
In fact, our teams have been around for a considerable time. Our governance and stewardship team was set up in 1992, and we’re seen as one of the leading UK institutions in this area.
A reputation  that opens doors
Our financial strength and professional reputation encourage companies’ management to consider our views, and take them into account where possible.
Our governance and stewardship team works closely with the companies we invest in, promoting compliance with UK and international codes of corporate governance. Companies are also required to demonstrate that they manage their social and environmental impacts effectively. By holding frequent one-to-one meetings with directors of companies and company secretaries, we’re able to raise any concerns with them directly. We also publicise our concerns where appropriate – you’ll find examples of this in the Letters, Statements & Articles section.

The UK Stewardship Code



The UK Stewardship Code - Compliance and Contacts
Standard Life Investments is a strong supporter of the principles of good stewardship that are set out in the Stewardship Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2010, and updated in September 2012. We believe that it is mutually beneficial for companies and long-term investors such as Standard Life Investments to have a relationship based on accountability, engagement and trust. Such a relationship helps to ensure that each has a good understanding of the other's views and expectations and it enables us to exercise constructive influence as and when appropriate. We believe that this serves to enhance the long-term value of our clients' investments and to protect their interests when necessary.
Likewise, it is very important that we are accountable to our clients for our stewardship of their assets. Accordingly, we seek to have a transparent and open dialogue with them about how we engage with the companies in their portfolios. Their feedback helps to shape our views and approach.
We are signatories to the Stewardship Code. We comply fully with all the Code's principles in respect of our UK equity investments, as described in the links below. We shall continue to take steps to strengthen our stewardship capabilities in line with the Code in respect of our European equity investments. We shall also use our best endeavours to apply the spirit of the Code's principles in respect of our other global equity investments on a case-by-case basis.

Principle 1 – How we discharge our stewardship responsibilities
Principle 2 – Our policy for managing conflicts of interests
Principle 3 – How we monitor our investee companies
Principle 4 – Our guidelines for escalating engagement
Principle 5 – Our willingness to act collectively with other investors
Principle 6 – Our policy on voting and voting disclosure
Principle 7 – How we report on stewardship to our clients
