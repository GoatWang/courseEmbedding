DENVER & MONTREAL--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX: TPX), today announced that 
      Tracey Joubert, current Chief Financial Officer of the Company’s US 
      business, has been appointed as Molson Coors’ new Chief Financial 
      Officer, effective immediately.
    

      President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, Mark Hunter, 
      stated, “We are very excited to have Tracey join our executive 
      leadership team as our new CFO. I have had the privilege of working 
      closely with Tracey for several years and am confident she is very 
      knowledgeable about the Molson Coors organization, our commercial 
      strategy and where we are heading as a bigger, better business. We are 
      also fortunate that she is well known to our investor community as a 
      highly qualified and respected financial leader who has overseen the 
      successful growth of our US business. We fully expect this to be a 
      seamless transition as we continue to accelerate our First Choice agenda 
      and deliver long term shareholder value.”
    

      Joubert offered, “I am very excited to lead the finance function at 
      Molson Coors. I am very familiar with the company and very supportive of 
      its plans. With the full acquisition of MillerCoors, it’s a critical 
      point in the bigger and stronger Molson Coors and I am ready to bring 
      the financial discipline and leadership necessary to deliver the growth 
      our employees and shareholders expect.”
    

      Joubert has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial 
      Officer for MillerCoors since 2012. Previously, she was Vice President 
      of finance, planning & analysis and controller for MillerCoors and 
      before that as Director of finance and group services at Miller Brewing 
      Company. She came to Miller from SAB Limited in Johannesburg, South 
      Africa, where she served as financial manager, technical accounting, and 
      was later promoted to financial manager, finance services. Prior to 
      joining SAB Limited, she was financial manager at Barloworld, Ltd. and 
      articled at KPMG South Africa. Joubert holds bachelor’s degrees in 
      commerce and accounting from the University of Witwatersrand in South 
      Africa. She also serves on the Board of Directors of the Terrapin Beer 
      Company and Coors Distributing Company.
    

      Mauricio Restrepo has resigned from his position as Chief Financial 
      Officer of Molson Coors Brewing Company, effective immediately. Mr. 
      Restrepo resigned because of matters regarding personal conduct 
      unrelated to the operations or financial statements of the Company.

Forward-Looking Statements


This press release includes statements that constitute 
      “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal 
      securities laws. Generally, the words “believe,” "expect,” 
      "intend,” "anticipate,” “project,” “will,” and similar expressions 
      identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historic in 
      nature. Although the Company believes that the assumptions upon 
      which its forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, it can 
      give no assurance that these assumptions will prove to be correct. 
      Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from the Company’s historical experience, and present projections and 
      expectations are disclosed in the Company’s filings with the Securities 
      and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These factors include, among 
      others, our ability to successfully integrate the acquisition of 
      MillerCoors; our ability to achieve expected tax benefits, accretion and 
      cost savings and synergies; impact of increased competition resulting 
      from further consolidation of brewers, competitive pricing and product 
      pressures; health of the beer industry and our brands in our markets; 
      economic conditions in our markets; additional impairment charges; our 
      ability to maintain manufacturer/distribution agreements; changes in our 
      supply chain system; availability or increase in the cost of packaging 
      materials; success of our joint ventures; risks relating to operations 
      in developing and emerging markets; changes in legal and regulatory 
      requirements, including the regulation of distribution systems; 
      fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; increase in the cost of 
      commodities used in the business; the impact of climate change and the 
      availability and quality of water; loss or closure of a major brewery or 
      other key facility; our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, 
      including executing and realizing cost savings; our ability to 
      successfully integrate newly acquired businesses; pension plan costs; 
      failure to comply with debt covenants or deterioration in our credit 
      rating; our ability to maintain good labor relations; our ability to 
      maintain brand image, reputation and product quality; lack of 
      full-control over the operations of MillerCoors and other risks 
      discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this press 
      release are expressly qualified by such cautionary statements and by 
      reference to the underlying assumptions. You should not place undue 
      reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date 
      they are made. We do not undertake to update forward-looking 
      statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
      otherwise.
