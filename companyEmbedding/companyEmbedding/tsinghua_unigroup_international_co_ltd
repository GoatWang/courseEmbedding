Company officials[edit]
Hu Haifeng (Chinese: 胡海峰), son of Hu Jintao, former Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party, was appointed in 2009[citation needed] as the Party Committee Secretary of Tsinghua Holdings, often regarded as the de facto highest role of the company.
The current Party Committee Secretary of Tsinghua Holdings was Long Dawei (Chinese: 龙大伟),[2] which also served as the vice-chairman. The current chairman was Xu Jinghong (Chinese: 徐井宏).[3]
Rong Yonglin (Chinese: 荣泳霖) was the former chairman of the holding.[4]
History[edit]
Tsinghua Holdings was formally formed in 2003 (but tested as a test bed in 2001)[5] in response to the 2001 policy of setting firewall between university and university-owned enterprises;[6] all the shares of those subsidiaries of Tsinghua University were transferred to Tsinghua Holdings. In the announcement of the State Council of China in 2001, the plan was aimed to separate ownership and management, which professional business manager would be employed, as well as separation of assets of operating business and non-operating business. The university itself did not invested in other company anymore, but through the holding. The role of the university was supervising the holding via nominating board of directors to supervise it business plan, major investment, salary structure and other roles.[7]
The predecessor of Tsinghua Holdings was incorporated in 26 August 1992 (as Chinese: 北京清华大学企业集团), which the university used an established company to become a new holding company in 2001 for its subsidiaries. According to 2010 Annual Report of Tsinghua Holdings, some assets that non related to its business scope were transferred back to the university.[8]

Chengzhi Shareholding[edit]
Chengzhi Co., Ltd was set up in Jiangxi province; its controlling shareholder is Tsinghua Holdings, and it was part of the corporate structure used in the acquisition of Shijiashuang Yongsheng Huatsing Liquid Crystal Co.[9]
Tsing Capital[edit]
Tsing Capital describes itself as the exclusive clean tech venture capital arm of Tsinghua Holdings.[10]
Tsinghua Tongfang[edit]
Tsinghua Tongfang Co., Ltd. is widely involved in consumer electronics and energy, with interests ranging from software outsourcing, through the manufacture of PC hardware, to the use of fly ash and the manufacture of LEDs. A particular field was the Nuctech Container Inspection System.
Tsinghua Unigroup[edit]
Tsinghua Unigroup is 51% owned by Tsinghua Holdings and 49% owned by Beijing Jiankun Investment Group; this latter group is controlled by Zhao Weiguo who is also chairman and CEO of Tsinghua Unigroup. In late 2013 it made two acquisitions (Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics) each of which involved a payment larger than its market cap, suggesting that it is acting on behalf of a fund elsewhere. This is believed to be part of a Chinese-government attempt to consolidate the fabless semiconductor sector.[11][12] In April 2016, Tsinghua Unigroup announced it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Portland, Ore.-based Lattice Semiconductor through share purchases on the open market.[13] In Nov. 30, 2016 Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. announced an agreement to form a joint-venture with ChipMOS Taiwan.
Unisplendour[edit]
Unisplendour was one of the components merged into Tsinghua Holdings when it was created; it was founded in 1988 and renamed Unisplendour in 1993. It now appears to be another conglomerate, doing everything from operating a hotel at the East Gate of Tsinghua University[14] to doing large-scale software development for municipal and provincial governments across China, constructing infrastructure for highways, and producing scanners, laptops and digital cameras.[15] In 2015, Unisplendour acquired 15% of Western Digital, expanding into the storage market as well.[16]

Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. Key Developments

Tsinghua Unigroup Seeks Acquisitions
Mar 28 17
Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. has clinched as much as CNY 150 billion of financing from two Chinese government-backed investors, amassing a pool of funds to pursue acquisitions and build a world-class semiconductor industry.


Tsinghua Unigroup Reportedly Seeking IPO Of Unigroup Spreadtrum In 2018
Feb 23 17
Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. is reportedly seeking IPO of  Unigroup Spreadtrum RDA in 2018. Tsinghua Unigroup is pushing for an initial public offering of its mobile chip unit, Unigroup Spreadtrum RDA, in 2018, sources told Nikkei Asian Review. "The company is currently talking to accountants and lawyers to prepare for its initial public offering in China though they have not quite decided which stock exchange they want to choose for listing," said a person familiar with the matter. "Tsinghua Unigroup has always wanted to have Unigroup Spreadtrum RDA go public." The person together with another industry source said the IPO was set to be launched in 2018. A Tsinghua Unigroup spokesperson confirmed to Nikkei Asian Review that his group was working to bring Unigroup Spreadtrum RDA public, but declined to provide details on the schedule. Although the deal is still subject to external factors and the company has not decided where to list, there is little doubt that it will be one of the most prominent and closely watched IPOs to hit the market.


Toshiba Reportedly Seeks To Sell Stake In Its Chip Unit
Feb 6 17
Toshiba Corporation (TSE:6502) intention to spin off and sell a portion of its chip unit has been hindered by potential buyers' lack of interest in the small stake on offer, Nikkei Asian Review reports. Toshiba has received investment proposals from about five parties, down from the 10 or so that had originally shown interest in a purchase, the report says. Among those who indicated interest are Western Digital Corporation (NasdaqGS:WDC), Micron Technology, Inc. (NasdaqGS:MU) and Bain Capital, LP, the report notes. SK Hynix Inc. (KOSE:A000660) has submitted an initial bid to acquire a stake in Toshiba Corp's memory chip business, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The  person said it has not been decided how much a stake SK Hynix will acquire in Toshiba's memory business as the deal is in early stages. A SK Hynix spokesman declined to comment, and Toshiba could not be immediately reached for comment. Possible suitors from China, including Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd., did not express interest, the report says. The deadline for proposals to buy a stake probably fell around Friday, the report notes.

Company officials[edit]
Hu Haifeng (Chinese: 胡海峰), son of Hu Jintao, former Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party, was appointed in 2009[citation needed] as the Party Committee Secretary of Tsinghua Holdings, often regarded as the de facto highest role of the company.
The current Party Committee Secretary of Tsinghua Holdings was Long Dawei (Chinese: 龙大伟),[2] which also served as the vice-chairman. The current chairman was Xu Jinghong (Chinese: 徐井宏).[3]
Rong Yonglin (Chinese: 荣泳霖) was the former chairman of the holding.[4]
History[edit]
Tsinghua Holdings was formally formed in 2003 (but tested as a test bed in 2001)[5] in response to the 2001 policy of setting firewall between university and university-owned enterprises;[6] all the shares of those subsidiaries of Tsinghua University were transferred to Tsinghua Holdings. In the announcement of the State Council of China in 2001, the plan was aimed to separate ownership and management, which professional business manager would be employed, as well as separation of assets of operating business and non-operating business. The university itself did not invested in other company anymore, but through the holding. The role of the university was supervising the holding via nominating board of directors to supervise it business plan, major investment, salary structure and other roles.[7]
The predecessor of Tsinghua Holdings was incorporated in 26 August 1992 (as Chinese: 北京清华大学企业集团), which the university used an established company to become a new holding company in 2001 for its subsidiaries. According to 2010 Annual Report of Tsinghua Holdings, some assets that non related to its business scope were transferred back to the university.[8]

Chengzhi Shareholding[edit]
Chengzhi Co., Ltd was set up in Jiangxi province; its controlling shareholder is Tsinghua Holdings, and it was part of the corporate structure used in the acquisition of Shijiashuang Yongsheng Huatsing Liquid Crystal Co.[9]
Tsing Capital[edit]
Tsing Capital describes itself as the exclusive clean tech venture capital arm of Tsinghua Holdings.[10]
Tsinghua Tongfang[edit]
Tsinghua Tongfang Co., Ltd. is widely involved in consumer electronics and energy, with interests ranging from software outsourcing, through the manufacture of PC hardware, to the use of fly ash and the manufacture of LEDs. A particular field was the Nuctech Container Inspection System.
Tsinghua Unigroup[edit]
Tsinghua Unigroup is 51% owned by Tsinghua Holdings and 49% owned by Beijing Jiankun Investment Group; this latter group is controlled by Zhao Weiguo who is also chairman and CEO of Tsinghua Unigroup. In late 2013 it made two acquisitions (Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics) each of which involved a payment larger than its market cap, suggesting that it is acting on behalf of a fund elsewhere. This is believed to be part of a Chinese-government attempt to consolidate the fabless semiconductor sector.[11][12] In April 2016, Tsinghua Unigroup announced it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Portland, Ore.-based Lattice Semiconductor through share purchases on the open market.[13] In Nov. 30, 2016 Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. announced an agreement to form a joint-venture with ChipMOS Taiwan.
Unisplendour[edit]
Unisplendour was one of the components merged into Tsinghua Holdings when it was created; it was founded in 1988 and renamed Unisplendour in 1993. It now appears to be another conglomerate, doing everything from operating a hotel at the East Gate of Tsinghua University[14] to doing large-scale software development for municipal and provincial governments across China, constructing infrastructure for highways, and producing scanners, laptops and digital cameras.[15] In 2015, Unisplendour acquired 15% of Western Digital, expanding into the storage market as well.[16]

SHANGHAI, Dec. 23, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. ("Tsinghua Unigroup"), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co., Ltd., a solely state-owned limited liability corporation funded by Tsinghua University in China, and Spreadtrum Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:   SPRD; "Spreadtrum" or the "Company"), a leading fabless semiconductor provider in China with advanced technology in 2G, 3G and 4G wireless communications standards, today jointly announced the completion of the approximately US$1.7 billion merger of Spreadtrum with an affiliate of Tsinghua Unigroup (the "Merger") as contemplated by the previously announced agreement and plan of merger, dated as of July 12, 2013 (the "Merger Agreement"), between Tsinghua Unigroup and Spreadtrum.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which was approved by the Company's shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting held on September 4, 2013, each of the Company's ordinary shares (each, an "Ordinary Share"), including Ordinary Shares represented by American Depositary Shares, each representing three Ordinary Shares (the "ADSs"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, have been cancelled in exchange for the right to receive ten and one-third U.S. dollars (US$10.33) per Ordinary Share, or thirty-one U.S. dollars (US$31.00) per ADS (less US$0.05 per ADS cancellation fees), in each case in cash without interest and net of any applicable withholding taxes, except for (i) Ordinary Shares held by the Company as treasury shares, (ii) Ordinary Shares owned by holders who have validly exercised and not effectively withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights pursuant to Section 238 of the Cayman Islands Companies Law, as amended, and (iii) Ordinary Shares held by Citibank, N.A., in its capacity as ADS depositary (the "ADS Depositary"), that underlie ADSs reserved (but not yet allocated) by the Company for issuance upon the exercise of any options or settlement of any restricted share units of the Company under its share incentive plans.
Holders of Ordinary Shares of record as of the effective time of the Merger who are entitled to the Merger consideration will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions on how to surrender their share certificates in exchange for the Merger consideration. Holders of Ordinary Shares should wait to receive the letter of transmittal before surrendering their share certificates. For any questions relating to the share certificate surrender and payment procedures, holders of Ordinary Shares of record may contact Citibank, N.A., in its capacity as the paying agent (the "Paying Agent"), at 1-877-498-5424 (U.S. and Canada) or 1-781-930-4925 (outside of the U.S. and Canada). Regarding ADS holders, payment will be made to holders of ADSs after the ADS Depositary receives the Merger consideration from the Paying Agent.
"The completion of the Merger is an important milestone for Spreadtrum and the semiconductor industry in China," commented Jinghong Xu, Chairman of Tsinghua Holdings Co., Ltd. He continued, "Spreadtrum's joining Tsinghua will significantly enhance Tsinghua's position in the communications, semiconductor and technology industries.  The transaction will have a positive impact on the landscape of those industries domestically and globally. In reaching its current position, Spreadtrum has benefited greatly from investment policies available to businesses in Shanghai.  Tsinghua will continue to make investments in Shanghai, and we believe that Spreadtrum, as a member of the Tsinghua's overall industrial group, will grow even stronger in Shanghai."
Weiguo Zhao, Chairman and President of Tsinghua Unigroup, said, "We appreciate the considerable support that we have received from our government and various partners in connection with the Merger. In line with the strategic planning of Tsinghua University and Tsinghua Holdings, we look forward to working closely with Spreadtrum's outstanding management team and employees to advance the semiconductor industry in China."
"We are pleased to become a member of the Tsinghua family," commented Dr. Leo Li, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Spreadtrum. "With the continuing support of Shanghai, we look forward to increasing our growth by leveraging Tsinghua University's innovative resources as well as the overall advantages of Tsinghua's industrial group."
Morrison & Foerster LLP served as legal advisor, and Credit Suisse served as financial advisor, to Tsinghua Unigroup. Kilometre Capital served as strategic consultant to Spreadtrum.
