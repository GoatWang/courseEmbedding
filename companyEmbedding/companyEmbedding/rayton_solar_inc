How This Bill Nye-Endorsed Startup Plans to Upend the Solar Industry


Rayton Solar creates its solar panels in a completely new way.

Solar energy might very well be the way of the future--but it still has a ways to go. Less than one percent of all U.S. energy consumption comes from solar, a number that's remained low largely because consumers are scared off by the high initial costs and the aesthetics.
A startup out of Los Angeles thinks it has a solution to one of those problems. Rayton Solar says it has found a way to manufacture solar panels using a high tech process that can shave costs by up to 60 percent. Rayton's process uses less material and creates less waste, driving down the price for both the company and its potential customers.
Silicon, the key component of solar panels, also happens to be the most expensive. Solar panels and electronics are conventionally manufactured by taking a block of silicon and trimming it down using a wire saw. It's a process that wastes up to 50 percent of the silicon, turning it into sawdust or unusable shards--which isn't a huge deal if you're creating the tiny chips that go into phones and computers, but becomes much more significant when making large panels. And lots of waste means high prices for the consumer: The average solar installation can run around $20,000 before tax incentives.
Rayton found a way to avoid creating much of that waste. The company's founder, Andrew Yakub, previously worked in UCLA's Particle Beam Physics Lab and founded a government grant-based solar energy company, ReGen America. Using a technique called ion implantation, which Yakub says has been used since the 1980s but is yet to be commercialized, Rayton injects protons at specific depth within the atoms of a chunk of silicon. Technicians then apply heat, which lets them trim off a thin slice of silicon with very little waste produced.
The decreased manufacturing costs mean Rayton can afford to use the highest grade silicon available--the same grade used in NASA's technology. The silicon wafers it slices off are 3 microns thick, compared to the industry standard of about 200 microns. And less silicon used also contributes to a lower cost to manufacture. Overall, Yakub says his panels can be 25 percent more efficient than the industry standard while using about 1 percent of the material.
To help market Rayton's product--and offer some assurance of its viability--Yakub reached out to a giant in the science community: Bill Nye. After much back and forth between Yakub and Nye's agent earlier this year, "The Science Guy" agreed to come check out the product at Rayton's LA headquarters. Yakub says it was only after he spent hours asking questions and carefully vetting the product that Nye agreed to put his name behind it. He then filmed a video explaining the science behind Rayton's process, which the company now proudly displays on its site.
"That was a new experience," Yakub says. "Being a scientist, you don't really get to do much work with celebrities."
Rayton currently has six employees and has raised $2.8 million in funding, $2.4 of which came through accredited investor portal Fundable.com. The solar panels are now in the design stage, and Yakub hopes to begin manufacturing for consumers in about 12 months.
Check out Nye's explainer video of the technology below.

We Help Companies Get
                    Crowdfunded
We’ve built the largest business crowdfunding
                platform dedicated exclusively to helping companies raise capital.










Entrepreneurs create over 6 million new businesses each year in the
                        United States, and yet only a fraction receive funding. We’ve set out to change that by creating
                        a business crowdfunding platform that enables companies to raise capital from investors,
                        customers, and friends. Here are the three things that have made Fundable the leading platform
                        for business crowdfunding:







Hands-On Service
Our team takes a very hands-on approach to help companies understand the fundraising process and
                        launch their funding campaigns. From profile creation to marketing, we’re there at each
                        step.
Founder Friendly
Fundable was created by the founders of startups who have collectively raised from dozens of
                        angel investors and venture capitalists. We understand the challenges you face as you create a

Rayton Solar Inc has developed the technology to produce solar panels that are 62% cheaper than the industry standard and are 25% more efficient.
Rayton is entering a $10.1 Billion Solar Panel Market with the lowest manfucturing cost and higher cell efficiency. 













Rayton Solar Inc's technology allows solar to be cost competitive with fossil fuels without the need for government subsidies. The conventional solar manufacturing process wastes an unnecessarily large amount of silicon. The industry standard is to cut a raw silicon ingot with a diamond wire, which wastes more than half of the silicon ingot. Additionally, wafers can not be cut thinner than 150-200 microns due to mechanical friction. Less than 4 microns is needed for the silicon to be a charge carrier so this extra material in conventional wafers is an unnecessary expense. By using a particle accelerator rather than a diamond wire, Rayton Solar can produce silicon wafers that are 4 microns thick. 
Rayton Solar is the only company in the world that can produce 4 micron thick silicon without any waste. Thus, reducing the amount of silicon used per solar module by a factor of 50x-100x. This leads to an overall 60% reduction in manufacturing cost and a kWh price on par with the cheapest fossil fuels.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
