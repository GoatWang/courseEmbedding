Investors Choice Awards 2016 Americas Winners Announced
 



 



New York, April 13th 2016 - Allocator, the data platform for the investment management industry, has announced the winners of its Investors Choice Awards 2016 for the Americas region. Mendon Capital, and Axel Capital Management won the major awards of the night, being the Fund of the Year and the Emerging Fund of the Year, respectively. Mendon Capital in fact took three awards on the evening, also winning the Specialist Equity Fund of 2015 and the Specialist Equity Fund - Long Term Performance categories. Scott Wapner, host of CNBC’s Fast Money Halftime Report, presented on the evening. 280 people attended the event, which was held at the Plaza Hotel in New York.“The winners of the night were chosen by experienced investors, people who can evaluate funds on more than just performance, and this is what makes the awards special for the funds and fund managers” said David Tawil, co-founder of Allocator.This year, award finalists are being honored and the winners announced at two gala dinners in New York and London.The awards were judged by a distinguished panel of institutional investors in funds and they took into account a set of qualitative criteria covering the investment process, risk management framework and depth of research team, as well as a set of quantitative performance measures including annualized returns, volatility and maximum drawdown.Allocator is also a proud corporate partner of the Peter C. Alderman Foundation (PCAF), which is a beneficiary of the Investors Choice Awards 2016 New York Gala Dinner. Setup as a living memorial following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, PCAF trains indigenous health workers to heal the emotional wounds of survivors of terrorism and mass violence.Congratulations to all the shortlisted fund managers and award winners!
