Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ann (NYSE:ANN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Challenges
Challenges are what ails your customers and the pain you relieve.


Solution
Your solution is the primary way that you solve your customer's problems.


Growth
The growth opportunity is the size of the market and what you can capture.







Vision explains the "why"
Create a vivid picture of where you want your product to be in the future. That is your vision. Make better decisions — faster — because your team will be aligned and able to maintain clear focus.







Know thy customer
Paint a picture of your customers by creating custom personas. Describe everything about them and then link the personas to actual features so you know who you are building for.












Track the competition
Create in-depth profiles of key competitors and publish the info for your team. Capture critical information such as revenue, customers, growth rate, and your own custom fields.









Set goals
Highlight your strategic objectives and the KPIs that you plan on achieving. Track your progress against the goals so the team knows how the business is doing.

        Define the whys, whens, and whats


        Roadmapping comes first, build what matters second
      







          Aha! is the one product management tool you need to lead product with conviction and be happy doing it. If you are like most product managers, Aha! is what you have always wanted to replace the Word, Google, Excel, Dropbox, and PPT docs that are scattered all over your hard drive and the cloud.
        











How does your product team work?
No matter what type of product team you work with, Aha! is a tool for driving product strategy, sharing your roadmap, and detailing features and user stories. We call this the why, when, and what of roadmapping. Engineering teams are responsible for how features get developed.



The Why
Goals and initiatives


The When
Schedules and timelines


The What
Releases and features


The How
Engineering development



We know that you are doing your best to explain where the product is headed, highlight the business value, and lead your product team. We also know that engineering teams can be demanding. They want to understand your vision for the product and they require detailed features and user stories to efficiently build what customers want. The reality is that it’s not easy with the product management tools you have.
How does your engineering team work?
While many engineering teams have a bug tracking system to manage their work, others do not. Aha! works in both environments but is fundamentally designed for you – the product manager. If your engineering team uses a bug system like JIRA, we integrate directly with it allowing you to set strategy, releases, and features in Aha! and send them to JIRA to be worked. As engineers work and update JIRA, Aha! is automatically updated and you can always easily check what's happening without having to navigate another tool.
Aha! also works well for teams that do not have a bug or other engineering planning system. Aha! provides a workflow board for agile or scrum teams, status controls by feature and requirement, and cross-functional release gantt charts so you are always informed. So, regardless of how your team works, Aha! is the product tool built for you.
