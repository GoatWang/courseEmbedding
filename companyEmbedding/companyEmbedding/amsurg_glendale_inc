Since our entrepreneurial beginnings, AMSURG has played a vital, pioneering role in the establishment of the ambulatory surgery center (ASC) industry and continues to innovate for the future. Today, AMSURG is not only among the largest surgery center management companies, but is also expanding our collaborative approach to hospital physician services and transportation through the acquisition of Sheridan Healthcare and merger with Envision Healthcare.
With more than 2,000 physician partners at 245+ ambulatory surgery center locations across the United States, AMSURG is the nationally recognized leader in the strategic and operational management of surgery centers, which include endoscopy, ophthalmology and orthopaedics. Strong partnerships, built on trust, communication and collaboration, have been the foundation of our company’s success and are essential to our future.
AMSURG surgery centers are the venue for high quality, high value, same-day surgical service with a superior patient experience. As a leader in the ambulatory surgery center quality movement, AMSURG provides a unique approach to combining technology, data analytics, patient engagement and quality reporting that results in optimal outcomes for patients. As a result, we provide health care value, improve patient experience and save lives.
AMSURG strengthens the overall quality of health care delivery by providing superior and comprehensive resources to optimize each surgery center, freeing our physician partners to focus on patient care and supporting the pursuit of their professional and personal goals.
“Never before in the history of AMSURG has our mission of helping physician partners improve, adapt and grow been more relevant than it is today with everyone in health care being impacted by health care reform,” said Chris Holden, AMSURG president and chief executive officer and director.
AMSURG and Sheridan creates a new powerhouse in health care that combines a strong national presence, leading market positions in multiple service lines and extensive local market expertise.
