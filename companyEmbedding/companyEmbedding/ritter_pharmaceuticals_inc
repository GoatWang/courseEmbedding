Lactagen®
After experiencing great success with Lactagen®, Ritter Pharmaceuticals is pursuing FDA approval, in order to develop the first prescription treatment for lactose intolerance.
Unfortunately, Lactagen® is no longer for sale. Lactagen® has been successful in helping thousands of lactose intolerant sufferers, and we hope to help millions in the future. Unfortunately, based on the regulatory restrictions in the U.S., Europe and around the world, going through regulatory clinical trials is the most prudent approach to ensure worldwide application and availability of our product. We are working as fast as possible to bring this treatment to the market.
About Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc. develops novel therapeutic products, which modulate the human gut microbiome and has the potential to treat inflammatory, gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. Our microbiome modulators provide specialized nutrition that selectively increases the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colonic ecosystem and creates significant improvement in the health of individuals that suffer from these diseases.
About RP-G28, A Treatment for Lactose Intolerance
RP-G28 has the potential to become the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of lactose intolerance, a debilitating disease that affects over 1 billion people worldwide. The product is understood to stimulate the growth of lactose-metabolizing bacteria in the colon, which reduces lactose-derived gas production, and thereby mitigates the symptoms of lactose intolerance in the process. RP-G28,for the treatment of lactose intolerance, is currently in late stage 2 clinical trials. You may read more about RP-G28’s recently published clinical data at http://www.nutritionj.com/content/pdf/1475-2891-12-160.pdf.

Ritter Pharmaceuticals Receives Non-Compliance Notice From Nasdaq
Jun 9 17
On June 7, 2017, Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc. received a letter (Notice) from The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for its common stock has been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, it no longer complies with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”), and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until December 4, 2017 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. During the compliance period, the Company’s shares of common stock will continue to be listed and traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180 calendar day grace period. In the event the Company is not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by December 4, 2017 the Company may be afforded a second 180 calendar day grace period. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirements for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In addition, the Company would be required to provide written notice of its intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during this second 180 day compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. The Company intends to actively monitor the bid price for its common stock between now and December 4, 2017 and will consider available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
