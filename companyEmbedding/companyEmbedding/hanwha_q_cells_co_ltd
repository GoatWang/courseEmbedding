SPI 2016: Hanwha Q CELLS Completes Strong Q.ANTUM Portfolio with Monocrystalline Solar Module Series "Q.PEAK"
- Q.PEAK Q.ANTUM modules reaching up to 370 Wp (72 cell) and 305Wp (60 cell) will be available starting from Q3 2017 and Q1 2017 respectively- Half-Cell and Double Glass prototypes take Q.ANTUM to the next level- Q CELLS' Q.ANTUM technology for higher yields and lower LCOE matured through more than 440 million or 2 GW of solar cells produced since 2012


IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Hanwha Q CELLS Co., Ltd. ("Hanwha Q CELLS" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: HQCL), one of the world's largest photovoltaic manufacturers of high-quality, high-efficiency solar modules, today announced that it will unveil a complete series of new monocrystalline solar modules and prototypes based on the company's proprietary Q.ANTUM technology at Solar Power International (SPI) in Las Vegas from September 13-15, 2016. The new monocrystalline Q.ANTUM modules will be called "Q.PEAK" and are set to supplement the award winning Q.PLUS range of polycrystalline solar 
modules, thus completing the strong product portfolio of Q.ANTUM based solar modules for higher yields enabling lower LCOE. The Q.PEAK modules, which will come in 60- and 72-cell form factors and reaching up to 305 Wp and 370 Wp respectively, will be on sale starting in Q1 2017 and Q3 2017 respectively. Exciting prototype products for release in Q4 2017 will also be displayed at booth 2337 in the North Hall at SPI: Q.PEAK prototypes using half-cell and double glass technologies will take Q.ANTUM to the next levels in terms of efficiency and performance as well as durability in harsh climates.
Hanwha Q CELLS emphasizes continuous growth ambition in U.S. solar market
With the launch of the more complete solar portfolio of Q CELLS at SPI 2016, Hanwha Q CELLS demonstrates its commitment to strengthen its market presence in the US solar market. "We cannot wait to present our current and next generation of Q.ANTUM products to PV customers in the USA," said Mr. Seong Woo Nam, Chairman and CEO of Hanwha Q CELLS. "Our new, enhanced and 'Engineered in Germany' Q.ANTUM product portfolio is set to meet and exceed the expectations of PV customers and investors in the USA. Moreover, we continue to build on our ability to supply large scales of 
tariff-free, high performance and quality modules along with corporate stability and reliability as one of the world's largest solar companies and a part of the Fortune Global 500 business enterprise, Hanwha Group." 
Q.PLUS and Q.PEAK: Award winning state of the art meets the next level of power and performance - altogether based on record breaking Q.ANTUM technology
The Company's highlights at this year's SPI will be the current polycrystalline solar modules, the monocrystalline next generation modules, as well as the monocrystalline prototypes using half-cell and double glass technologies - all based on Hanwha Q CELLS' proprietary and matured Q.ANTUM technology. Today, Q.ANTUM is the most advanced and matured PERC-based technology in the industry, as proven by world efficiency records as well as a track record of more than 440 million Q.ANTUM solar cells produced since 2012, equalling 2 GW. The latest world efficiency record for polycrystalline solar modules in standard size (1670 x 1000 mm2) is held by a Q.ANTUM module prototype of 19.5% and a power output of 301 watts, as confirmed by the independent Fraunhofer ISE institute. 
Q.ANTUM solar modules offer all of Q CELLS' VDE certified quality standards like Anti-PID protection, Hot-spot protect, and Tra.Q laser marking.
At the Hanwha Q CELLS booth, visitors will be able to experience the full spectrum of Q.ANTUM solar modules: 

The Q.PLUS BFR-G4.1/TAA comes in 60 polycrystalline cells, a black frame, and power class of up to 290 Wp. The Q.PLUS BFR-G4.1/TAA will be eligible in public tenders in the USA and are TAA compliant. 
The Q.PLUS L-G4.2/TAA is a 72 polycrystalline cell Q.ANTUM module with up to 345 Wp and will be eligible in public tenders in the USA (TAA compliant). 
The Q.PEAK BLK-G4.1 is based on monocrystalline wafers using Q.ANTUM technology. This 60 cell all black module reaches up to 300 Wp power output and will be available starting in Q1 2017 with a white back sheet option reaching up to 305 Wp. 
The Q.PEAK L-G4.2 is based on monocrystalline wafers featuring 72 black cells, a white back sheet, a silver frame, and reaches up to 370 Wp power output with availability starting in Q3 2017. 
The Q.PEAK-G4.1/MAX combines the advantages of cell-string optimizers with Q.ANTUM technology. 
The Q.PEAK-G4.1/H and the Q.PEAK BLK-G4.1/H prototypes come in a black and white appearance. Both add half-cell technology to Q.PEAK, boosting power output to up to 315 watts from a 60 cell solar module.

SolarOne[edit]
The company was established in 2004 in China as Solarfun Power Holdings by Linyang Electronics. In 2006, Solarfun was listed at NASDAQ. In 2008, Solarfun acquired a manufacturer of silicon ingots Jiangsu Yungguang Solar.[citation needed] In 2010, 49% of company shares was acquired by Hanwha Chemical, a subsidiary of the Hanwha Group. Consequently, the company was renamed Hanwha SolarOne. According to PVinsights, in 2010 it was seventh largest photovoltaic module producer in the world.[8]
Operations[edit]
The company develops and produces crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, panels, and silicon ingots and wafers.[9] It has production facilities in China, Malaysia and South Korea. Its two most important markets are Europe and Japan.[10]

It would be difficult to start talking about Hanwha without two words: trust and loyalty. 

These ideas have been the core values of Hanwha since its beginning, and they have acted as a compass throughout its decades. 

Founded in 1952, Hanwha began its business by manufacturing dynamite and other explosives during a time of national crisis—when the Korean War was coming to an end, leaving the nation in ruins. Few companies were willing to take on the risks. 

“To make explosives, precision is key, since everything must occur at an exact instant, in an exact way,” said Chong-Hee Kim, Founder of the Hanwha Group. “For this kind of control, we must trust one another completely.” 

This emphasis on teamwork and precision during Hanwha’s earliest days allowed a strong and unique culture to develop and become forever embedded into our company’s corporate DNA. 

During the following years of rapid growth, Hanwha expanded its business into various sectors and regions. Later, it was one of the few companies to survive the Asian economic crisis in 1997 and the global economic crisis in 2008. During good times and bad, the people of Hanwha stood behind our core values of trust and loyalty. 

Today, Hanwha is a world leader in solar energy and in construction. We are building an entire city – the largest project currently under construction in the Middle East by a South Korean company. 

It is also a major player in the global finance industry, continuously adapting to today’s rapidly changing financial landscapes and providing financial solutions that give customers the freedom to pursue their dreams. 

Although many companies talk about the value of trust and loyalty, there is only a few that actually put those ideas into action. 

For Hanwha, 'value' always comes first before its business, since Hanwha is focused on how and why the company is walking this path. 

Hanwha has a solid reputation for keeping promises with partners and customers, for valuing long-term relationships, and for contributing to society. This is the spirit of Hanwha. 

My name is Eddie Jung, and I am the editor of “Hanwha & Hanwha People,” the corporate magazine of the Hanwha Group. 

Rather than talking about it, why don’t you meet the actual people of Hanwha and see for yourself? 
Chemicals & Materials

Here at one of South Korea’s largest petrochemical facilities in the city of Yeosu, are 2 people who have worked together side by side for over 20 years. 

Editor) 
Hi guys, it’s so great to see you again. 
I don’t think you can underestimate the value of working together for 20 years, the way you two have. 

Eun jeong Kim) 
Hanwha co-workers have tremendous faith in one another. It bonds us, as does the work we’ve done. 

Seon-jeong Jin) 
Like with personal bonds, chemicals involve fusion. 

Eun jeong Kim) 
This fusion gives birth to new technology that lays a solid foundation for industry. 

Hanwha utilizes economies of scale. Petroleum products, base chemicals, resin, chlorine, caustic soda, and new materials, make up a diverse portfolio of chemicals we produce. 

And through a solid collaboration between all workers, our customers can depend on a reliable and stable product supply. 

Our goal is to make life easier and more meaningful to everyone. 

Seon-jeong Jin) 
Based on these petrochemical materials, Hanwha produces a variety of advanced materials. 

Our world-class automobile weight reducing materials like StrongLite(GMT) and SuperLite(LWRT), are already being exported to global automakers. These products are supplied through sales networks around the world. 

Editor) 
Petrochemicals are valuable not only to industry, it’s an important business that raises the quality of life. 

I’m proud of the people of Hanwha, who lay the foundation for our lives and for industry. 
Aerospace & Mechatronics

Hear at Hanwha’s Mechatronics Research Lab are a father, daughter, and son-in-law.
A family of employees that crosses a generation. 

Editor) 
When we first met, it was just one person…and now there are three. 

Jae il Kim) 
For two generations to work at this company shows how strongly we believe in this industry and in this company. 

Sun hee Kim) 
He’s right. Seeing my dad’s work, I realized Hanwha’s mechatronics technology is something to be grateful for. 

It does work that a human can’t do, because it’s too dangerous or requires extreme precision. It keeps the industry on the cutting edge, and makes our lives easier. 

If this technology keeps improving, one day we’ll live in the world that was once just in our imagination. 

As Hanwha endlessly advances in areas such as optronics, avionics, and unmanned vehicles, through its unmatched core technologies possibility becomes a reality, as we take a step closer to the future

Bong kyo Park) 
Our goal of using next-generation robotics solutions to create a world of innovation is Hanwha’s core desire to give people a safer and more convenient future. 

Even today, Hanwha continues to advance its technology so everyone can enjoy a better life. 
Solar Energy

Land that was dying from pollution and contamination, has now been transformed into a sustainable energy facility. The Maywood Solar Farm (Indiana, USA) 

(Editor) 
Dr. Christoph, great to see you again. It looks like you’ve taken a dying plot of land and given it a whole new life. 

Dr. Christoph) 
We can’t give up, can we? We need to protect the planet we’re living in.

Solar energy is a sustainable solution that transforms the way people produce and use energy. We’re in the business of using what the planet provides to its full potential.

Hanwha is the world’s leading producer of photovoltaics, with the world’s largest in-house cell production capacity. 

We operate a strategically diversified manufacturing footprint that gives us a significant competitive advantage. 

Editor) 
And it’s just not cells. Hanwha is providing comprehensive solutions that cover the entire value chain from polysilicon to ingots, wafers, and modules and downstream businesses. 

Dr. Christoph) 
You’re absolutely right. At the technology innovation center in Germany, we constantly research ways to produce state-of-the-art quality products, which go through rigorous quality controls to substantiate the reliability and efficiency. 

The global presence and trust that Hanwha Group has earned, its economies of scale, Hanwha Q CELLS’ unrivaled technology and efficient operation, all help Hanwha’s solar energy business in Europe, in Asia, in America and around the world stay intact and keep clients satisfied. 

We believe that solar energy is the best solution for several major problems facing our planet, such as climate change, energy depletion, and energy poverty. We’re on a mission to make solar energy the most trustworthy source of sustainable energy in the world. 

Editor)
Solar power is more than just an energy solution. It’s an endeavor that will preserve the earth’s environment for future generations. 
Finance
 
We’re here at Vietnam’s financial mecca, Ho Chi Minh City! Hanwha’s financial affiliates are placed all over Asia, demonstrating Korea’s financial strengths. 

Editor) 
Do you still value trust as highly as before? 

Trang) 
Of course. Because trust is the backbone of finance. Not only is it a personal belief, but trust and loyalty is a corporate philosophy that Hanwha believes is of utmost importance. 

With that foundation of trust, Hanwha has grown to be a global financial business that boasts more than 100 billion USD in assets. 

Hanwha has a comprehensive financial network, including life insurance, general insurance, investments, asset management, and savings. 

We’re now in Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and expanding into other Asian markets. With all the knowledge that we’ve accumulated for more than 70 years in the financial business in Korea, we’re looking to operate an even more secure, reliable financial system for people around the world. 

Editor) 
The trustworthiness of Hanwha. 

I can trust that Hanwha will make a richer and fuller tomorrow for its customers around the world
Construction

Bismayah, Iraq, known to many as the Miracle in the Desert.I remember once seeing a man so dedicated to his work even in the scorching heat. We meet again. 

Editor) 
Wow, the scale of this place is really amazing. Where did you find the strength to work in such difficult conditions? 

Ali) 
The amazing trust that we have with our clients and colleagues is what creates the miracle in the desert, as they say. There’s no way to accomplish what we have with an individual’s skill alone. Trust is the bedrock of this tremendous undertaking. 

Building and construction is a business that helps create a new world. 

From successfully winning the contract and carrying out the work of building the world’s biggest city development project in Bismayah, Iraq, to the Philippine Arena, the world’s largest domed arena built with cutting edge technology and the construction of the largest precast concrete plant, having worked on a broad range of overseas construction projects over the years, Hanwha has a deep pool of expertise. 

Hanwha will continue to make history by physically building a brighter future in every corner of the world. 

Editor) 
Hanwha continues growth in overseas construction revenue that it achieved in the past three years. 

I’m eager to see Hanwha take even bigger strides as a global corporation
Services & Leisure

I’m about to meet two people who are at the forefront of Hanwha’s Services & Leisure business. 

Editor) 
So nice to see you both again. You look fabulous and of course, you always have a great smile to greet me with. 

Yoon jeong Yoo) 
Of course! We smile, so our customers will too. 

Pil do Kim) 
We’re in the business of making people smile. 

Yoon jeong Yoo) 
If we’re able to make our customers happier, then we can smile together. We’re launching a variety of businesses that make a difference and bring more fulfillment to our customers’ lives. 

From the Galleria, a premium department store that leads Korea’s fashion trends, to THE PLAZA, a luxury boutique hotel in the heart of Seoul, and Korea’s largest condominium chain with 12 resorts, aquariums, golf courses, and various other leisure centers, we are one of Korea’s most well-known and respected leisure and lifestyle brands. 

Pil do Kim) 
You can’t leave out the duty free business where I work. We operate world-class duty free shops in Korea’s top tourist destinations, Seoul and Jeju. 

Yoon jeong Yoo) 
Hanwha has the largest and finest properties with unparalleled customer service to lead Korea’s lifestyle industry. 

Utilizing our longstanding expertise, we are entering China and other overseas markets. 

Editor) 
That’s why they say Hanwha symbolizes the best of Korea’s services and leisure industry. 

And your smiles are world-class.

Hanwha

Lastly, I’m meeting a man who started as a vendor and now, he makes up a valuable part of Hanwha.

Mr. Hong, your first contract with Hanwha was 50 years ago. Do you still remember?

It would be difficult to start talking about Hanwha without two words: trust and loyalty. 

These ideas have been the core values of Hanwha since its beginning, and they have acted as a compass throughout its decades. 

Founded in 1952, Hanwha began its business by manufacturing dynamite and other explosives during a time of national crisis—when the Korean War was coming to an end, leaving the nation in ruins. Few companies were willing to take on the risks. 

“To make explosives, precision is key, since everything must occur at an exact instant, in an exact way,” said Chong-Hee Kim, Founder of the Hanwha Group. “For this kind of control, we must trust one another completely.” 

This emphasis on teamwork and precision during Hanwha’s earliest days allowed a strong and unique culture to develop and become forever embedded into our company’s corporate DNA. 

During the following years of rapid growth, Hanwha expanded its business into various sectors and regions. Later, it was one of the few companies to survive the Asian economic crisis in 1997 and the global economic crisis in 2008. During good times and bad, the people of Hanwha stood behind our core values of trust and loyalty. 

Today, Hanwha is a world leader in solar energy and in construction. We are building an entire city – the largest project currently under construction in the Middle East by a South Korean company. 

It is also a major player in the global finance industry, continuously adapting to today’s rapidly changing financial landscapes and providing financial solutions that give customers the freedom to pursue their dreams. 

Although many companies talk about the value of trust and loyalty, there is only a few that actually put those ideas into action. 

For Hanwha, 'value' always comes first before its business, since Hanwha is focused on how and why the company is walking this path. 

Hanwha has a solid reputation for keeping promises with partners and customers, for valuing long-term relationships, and for contributing to society. This is the spirit of Hanwha. 

My name is Eddie Jung, and I am the editor of “Hanwha & Hanwha People,” the corporate magazine of the Hanwha Group. 

Rather than talking about it, why don’t you meet the actual people of Hanwha and see for yourself? 
Chemicals & Materials

Here at one of South Korea’s largest petrochemical facilities in the city of Yeosu, are 2 people who have worked together side by side for over 20 years. 

Editor) 
Hi guys, it’s so great to see you again. 
I don’t think you can underestimate the value of working together for 20 years, the way you two have. 

Eun jeong Kim) 
Hanwha co-workers have tremendous faith in one another. It bonds us, as does the work we’ve done. 

Seon-jeong Jin) 
Like with personal bonds, chemicals involve fusion. 

Eun jeong Kim) 
This fusion gives birth to new technology that lays a solid foundation for industry. 

Hanwha utilizes economies of scale. Petroleum products, base chemicals, resin, chlorine, caustic soda, and new materials, make up a diverse portfolio of chemicals we produce. 

And through a solid collaboration between all workers, our customers can depend on a reliable and stable product supply. 

Our goal is to make life easier and more meaningful to everyone. 

Seon-jeong Jin) 
Based on these petrochemical materials, Hanwha produces a variety of advanced materials. 

Our world-class automobile weight reducing materials like StrongLite(GMT) and SuperLite(LWRT), are already being exported to global automakers. These products are supplied through sales networks around the world. 

Editor) 
Petrochemicals are valuable not only to industry, it’s an important business that raises the quality of life. 

I’m proud of the people of Hanwha, who lay the foundation for our lives and for industry. 
Aerospace & Mechatronics

Hear at Hanwha’s Mechatronics Research Lab are a father, daughter, and son-in-law.
A family of employees that crosses a generation. 

Editor) 
When we first met, it was just one person…and now there are three. 

Jae il Kim) 
For two generations to work at this company shows how strongly we believe in this industry and in this company. 

Sun hee Kim) 
He’s right. Seeing my dad’s work, I realized Hanwha’s mechatronics technology is something to be grateful for. 

It does work that a human can’t do, because it’s too dangerous or requires extreme precision. It keeps the industry on the cutting edge, and makes our lives easier. 

If this technology keeps improving, one day we’ll live in the world that was once just in our imagination. 

As Hanwha endlessly advances in areas such as optronics, avionics, and unmanned vehicles, through its unmatched core technologies possibility becomes a reality, as we take a step closer to the future

Bong kyo Park) 
Our goal of using next-generation robotics solutions to create a world of innovation is Hanwha’s core desire to give people a safer and more convenient future. 

Even today, Hanwha continues to advance its technology so everyone can enjoy a better life. 
Solar Energy

Land that was dying from pollution and contamination, has now been transformed into a sustainable energy facility. The Maywood Solar Farm (Indiana, USA) 

(Editor) 
Dr. Christoph, great to see you again. It looks like you’ve taken a dying plot of land and given it a whole new life. 

Dr. Christoph) 
We can’t give up, can we? We need to protect the planet we’re living in.

Solar energy is a sustainable solution that transforms the way people produce and use energy. We’re in the business of using what the planet provides to its full potential.

Hanwha is the world’s leading producer of photovoltaics, with the world’s largest in-house cell production capacity. 

We operate a strategically diversified manufacturing footprint that gives us a significant competitive advantage. 

Editor) 
And it’s just not cells. Hanwha is providing comprehensive solutions that cover the entire value chain from polysilicon to ingots, wafers, and modules and downstream businesses. 

Dr. Christoph) 
You’re absolutely right. At the technology innovation center in Germany, we constantly research ways to produce state-of-the-art quality products, which go through rigorous quality controls to substantiate the reliability and efficiency. 

The global presence and trust that Hanwha Group has earned, its economies of scale, Hanwha Q CELLS’ unrivaled technology and efficient operation, all help Hanwha’s solar energy business in Europe, in Asia, in America and around the world stay intact and keep clients satisfied. 

We believe that solar energy is the best solution for several major problems facing our planet, such as climate change, energy depletion, and energy poverty. We’re on a mission to make solar energy the most trustworthy source of sustainable energy in the world. 

Editor)
Solar power is more than just an energy solution. It’s an endeavor that will preserve the earth’s environment for future generations. 
Finance
 
We’re here at Vietnam’s financial mecca, Ho Chi Minh City! Hanwha’s financial affiliates are placed all over Asia, demonstrating Korea’s financial strengths. 

Editor) 
Do you still value trust as highly as before? 

Trang) 
Of course. Because trust is the backbone of finance. Not only is it a personal belief, but trust and loyalty is a corporate philosophy that Hanwha believes is of utmost importance. 

With that foundation of trust, Hanwha has grown to be a global financial business that boasts more than 100 billion USD in assets. 

Hanwha has a comprehensive financial network, including life insurance, general insurance, investments, asset management, and savings. 

We’re now in Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and expanding into other Asian markets. With all the knowledge that we’ve accumulated for more than 70 years in the financial business in Korea, we’re looking to operate an even more secure, reliable financial system for people around the world. 

Editor) 
The trustworthiness of Hanwha. 

I can trust that Hanwha will make a richer and fuller tomorrow for its customers around the world
Construction

Bismayah, Iraq, known to many as the Miracle in the Desert.I remember once seeing a man so dedicated to his work even in the scorching heat. We meet again. 

Editor) 
Wow, the scale of this place is really amazing. Where did you find the strength to work in such difficult conditions? 

Ali) 
The amazing trust that we have with our clients and colleagues is what creates the miracle in the desert, as they say. There’s no way to accomplish what we have with an individual’s skill alone. Trust is the bedrock of this tremendous undertaking. 

Building and construction is a business that helps create a new world. 

From successfully winning the contract and carrying out the work of building the world’s biggest city development project in Bismayah, Iraq, to the Philippine Arena, the world’s largest domed arena built with cutting edge technology and the construction of the largest precast concrete plant, having worked on a broad range of overseas construction projects over the years, Hanwha has a deep pool of expertise. 

Hanwha will continue to make history by physically building a brighter future in every corner of the world. 

Editor) 
Hanwha continues growth in overseas construction revenue that it achieved in the past three years. 

I’m eager to see Hanwha take even bigger strides as a global corporation
Services & Leisure

I’m about to meet two people who are at the forefront of Hanwha’s Services & Leisure business. 

Editor) 
So nice to see you both again. You look fabulous and of course, you always have a great smile to greet me with. 

Yoon jeong Yoo) 
Of course! We smile, so our customers will too. 

Pil do Kim) 
We’re in the business of making people smile. 

Yoon jeong Yoo) 
If we’re able to make our customers happier, then we can smile together. We’re launching a variety of businesses that make a difference and bring more fulfillment to our customers’ lives. 

From the Galleria, a premium department store that leads Korea’s fashion trends, to THE PLAZA, a luxury boutique hotel in the heart of Seoul, and Korea’s largest condominium chain with 12 resorts, aquariums, golf courses, and various other leisure centers, we are one of Korea’s most well-known and respected leisure and lifestyle brands. 

Pil do Kim) 
You can’t leave out the duty free business where I work. We operate world-class duty free shops in Korea’s top tourist destinations, Seoul and Jeju. 

Yoon jeong Yoo) 
Hanwha has the largest and finest properties with unparalleled customer service to lead Korea’s lifestyle industry. 

Utilizing our longstanding expertise, we are entering China and other overseas markets.

That’s why they say Hanwha symbolizes the best of Korea’s services and leisure industry. 

And your smiles are world-class. 
I hope you never lose them.
