5.0 out of 5 starsHighly recommended to finally understand adult relationship issues, why they occur, and how to help resolve them.ByAMon April 3, 2017I have been looking for insight into my relationship experiences and challenges for almost 30 years. I've been in therapy for years with multiple therapists and had never heard the words "adult attachment theory" until I started seeing a new therapist earlier this year. I feel cheated, but that's another story. I now feel like I have entered an entirely new world where relationship issues now make sense. My new therapist recommended the book "Attached," which started to open my eyes, but I was left with a lot of questions and craving more information about adult attachment issues. "Mindsight" was the answer. This is a technical book about a complex subject but Siegel explains things well and gives very detailed real life examples. It is very analytical and explains the brain behind the emotions and behaviors that shape our relationships. It is particularly helpful in understanding anxious/avoidant attachment styles, which Siegel calls disorganized attachment, and avoidant. He also provides clear explanations of exercises and approaches in therapy that helped his patients resolve attachment issues. I can't recommend this book enough for insight and some relief that there is an explanation for human vulnerabilities in relationships. I have already recommended it to people I know. I have read tons of relationship books and now recommend this book followed by "Getting the Love You Want" to next understand who we are attracted to and what to do about it. There's no need for other books, these two explain it all as far as I can tell.

2.0 out of 5 starsThe small print makes the book a strain to readByShonduelon May 28, 2017Daniel  Siegel is a fascinating, thought provoking speaker which is why I bought the book.  However, the paperback version of the book has a tiny font on grey pages making it a strain on the eye to read so I probably won't.  The margins near the binding are minimal meaning you have to crank the binding apart so you can read to the end of the line. I am sure that the content of the book is exceptional, however the quality of the print and book is a huge disappointment.

Every once in a while, that simply will not do!  This book has become one of those "onces."I'm dying to have my very own copy on the shelves of my personal library so that I can highlight passages and make notes in the margin to my heart's content.  I knew within the first chapter that this was a book I would be quoting and recommending to students and clients.  Until my newly ordered book arrives, however, that library book goes NOWHERE!Those who are familiar with Seigel know already that the book's title refers to his lifelong fascination with the distinction between "mind" and "brain."  Reading some of the other reviews will allow those of you who are not already familiar with his work to understand that, while he certainly is an advocate of the use of mindfulness practices, this is NOT intended to be a book ABOUT mindfulness (despite what the publisher's "blurb" might suggest), nor is it a "how to" book.  If that is what you are looking for, this is not your book.  Likewise, if you have a library full of neuropsych, neurolinguistic, and psycho-social tomes, you will probably be happier with one of his other (more expensive) books.For the rest of you - this book is already on its way to becoming a classic. It is an easy-to-comprehend, plain-language explantation of how biology, intellect and emotions combine with conscious and unconcious brain processes to create our experience of life and living. His points are illustrated through (and anchored by) case studies and personal experiences.To quote another reviewer, "if you understand what is going on internally within you, often embedded in your subconscious from previous traumatic events, you can overcome it with MindSIGHT. So instead of reacting like an animal when someone enrages you, you exercise mindsight and utilise your executive control" [ . . . rising]  "above the auto-response," [ . . . using] "neuroscience to help you have an insight into your mind when emotions overtake you."THAT, I'd like to add, reframes your experience of the event -- part of the process of neuroplasticity, changing the very structure of your brain -- which ultimately transforms your experience of living.While Seigel is certainly not the ONLY author (or scientist) to link brain, body and mind, the way in which he puts it all together and connects it to therapy is uniquely his own contribution, and of significant merit.  For my money, this book comes about as close as it is possible to get attempting to condense a life's work into a single book written to be useful to "the general public" -- the many of us who don't have advanced degree's in the neuro-fields or the time to keep up with the latest research on oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells!For what it's worth, it definitely made the shortlist of required resources for my upcoming brain-based coach training curriculum.Madelyn Griffith-Haynie, SCAC, MCC - (blogging at ADDandSoMuchMore and on ADDerWorld - dot com!)"It takes a village to transform a world!"11 comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsoverwhelming, visionary, hope-inspiringByanonymouson November 23, 2015Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThe scope of this book has an unusual largeness.  It rattles my own basic ideas about psychology, and it also takes what had been favorite ideas of mine and sets them in a new terrain.  Favorite ideas that changed my life include the Carl Rogers' idea about attunement's role in healing (read in '89), Alan Watts's idea about being the observer at the bottom of the sea, watching your "mental waves" at the surface ('94), Christine Downing's and David L.Miller's ('98), Barry Magid's and Pema Chodron's (2010) ideas about complexity; about conflictual aspects of our triune brain; and about accepting my shadowy parts, and others', with love.  I look back at those "idea-milestones" with a new understanding, given the new neuroscience; each idea is here in Dr. Siegel's book with a more well-defined backdrop in the mind.The book synthesizes a lot of new research and inventively applies that very practically to how we can more effectively heal.  It is complex, addressing several aspects of our minds from different angles, combining many disciplines, linking differentiated languages into a new language.If that sounds overwhelming, it was for me!  But it is also very personal, with the stories of Dr. Siegel and his patients and others being a main vehicle of expression, and it is very enjoyable to read.  There is a heart of compassion and humanity at the center of the book, and the concept of mindsight.I see myself and relationships utterly differently.  I see how utterly dependent we are on each other and our cultures, for our own mental health (integration) and our own physical health, and for being able to express our potential in this world.  Our brains can't develop in a vacuum and only develop to reflect the quality of our relationships.  But the flip side is that it is possible to re-sculpt the brain in positive directions, in a therapeutic relationship, and in our relationships with ourselves and others.I also see, from the chapter on a couple's therapy, that a crucial element of healing is to see your own, and (in this chapter) especially others', minds from a place of curiosity, openness, and acceptance, to respect each other's developmental history and how it has shaped each other's minds.  I particularly feel this call for respect in how I have thought of my childhood and ancestral heritage, and the diagnostic labels that have helped me to make sense of it.  A piece that I can see differently is that infantile rage (provoked by brakes and accelerator at the same time), an ancestral heritage, is something stuck in the brain, and it can be unstuck, but especially that it can be seen for what it is, without letting it cloud and muddy one's compassion toward family.  The two can be separated.I myself am struggling to heal from PTSD and severe environmental sensitivities.  I feel more hope with these new mindsight approaches.  A common theme (across chapters) is healing the implicit patterns from childhood, unconsciously driving our lives, so that we can become authors of our own story, as we come more into the present and move into our future.  That said, I also have financial obstacles to getting access to these treatments.  I aspire to reach the "transpirational" part of my journey (p. 256), an expansion of our care and concern, beyond ourselves and our immediate relationships, to identify with the world and its inhabitants at large, and seek their well-being -- a natural, incidental part of developing mindsight and integrating the disconnections in our brains.In the meantime, I have turned a corner in developing my own mindsight with Dr. Siegel's books (building on graduate school, Jungian therapy, meditation, and ACA).  Turning this corner has made so much difference in the day-to-day, moment-to-moment quality of my life.  I had devised a new meditation based on Dr. Siegel's (with co-authors) 3 books on parenting, before I read Mindsight.  Now I see that my 4 phrases are very related to mindsight, and I want to share them because they have meant so much to me on my journey (I use them frequently, like a lovingkindness practice):I have a tender, open heart to [my current experience]I am aware and accepting of [my current experience]I an relaxed and soft [in my body as I hold my current experience]I am quiet and calm [as I keep company with my current experience]Developing mindsight "can give us access to [the] receptive self" (p. 209)..."an inner sanctuary...open to what is, ready to receive whatever arrives at the door, inviting all aspects of [one]self into the shelter of [one's] receptive mind" (p. 208).Another view-altering insight I had is that while I myself am aware of at least 9 traumatic adulthood events that may have given rise to my PTSD, I would need to track the body sensations and images of my trauma-activated episodes, with an emotionally safe specialist, to find the actual moments in time where the situations overwhelmed me.  I don't have any explicit memories of where the implicit trauma sensations are arising from, when I experience my almost-daily episodes.  When we discovered the actual moments, then I would have to re-experience the actual moments, with the specialist, and with a dual focus (one foot in the past, one foot in the present), and connect them into a narrative and integrate them into explicit memory.  After all these years of my studying PTSD, Dr. Siegel's understanding of the brain finally got that missing piece through to me.  The implicit sensations are coming from specific moments of my past that I cannot as yet pinpoint.I think psychoanalytic theories will have to keep evolving themselves to match the new neuroscience.  Thankfully, there are people like Dr. Siegel, with the passion and ability and fortitude to synthesize large amounts of new research information and translate that into paradigm-altering new forms of more understandable and more effective psychotherapy.  I know many are devoting their lives to this project, and it's exciting to be a part of it.  Dr. Siegel's work is a very big gift to me and us.44 comments|

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsBrain Science for Use with Social Sciences and Arts Too!ByFred Cheyunskion December 27, 2016Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseDaniel Siegel’s “Mindsight” is a very good book (as confirmed by its many reviews) that provides most recent brain science applied for personal and interpersonal concerns that can also be helpful in illuminating social science as well as artistic and literary matters.I came upon mention of this book while reading “The End of Stress: Four Steps to Rewire Your Brain” by Don Joseph Goewey which employs many of Siegel’s ideas as they can be useful to those involved in business and other stressful situations. My interest included learning more about the new developments in neuroscience, mental health and their implications for human potential as well.The book does not disappoint. Part I, with chapters 1-4, explains the most recent research and the way Siegel has incorporated these findings in developing his “mindsight” approach to facilitating insight into the workings of the brain, mind and relationships. Part II, with chapters 7-12, utilizes therapeutic cases to illustrate and delve further into “mindsight” in action and the power to change.My favorite parts included those about the triangle of well bring (mind, brain and relationships), the hand model of the brain, and brain diagrams. I enjoyed phrasing such as “what fires together, wires together” regarding neurons, energy and information flow as well as “name it, to tame it” regarding harnessing our emotions. Other aspects such as the mind as a regulatory process, the quest for integration including reconciling personal narratives or stories of our lives were also meaningful for me. On page 115, Siegel mentions the poet’s gift for translating feelings into words and mastery of such neural skill in dealing with the ongoing challenge to accurately depict our internal world.In the Foreword, Daniel Goleman (author of “Emotional Intelligence”) indicates that just as Freud’s theory of the unconscious (also Jung’s collective unconscious), Darwin’s model of evolution continues to help us understand the current research into human behavior, Daniel Siegel’s theory of mindsight offers similar opportunities to enlighten. During my reading, it seemed that Siegel’s approach has the potential to help provide enhanced interpretations for other criticism and social commentary.For instance, with Siegel’s emphasis on integration as the key to health and well-being, what might be a revision of territory covered in Daniel H. Pink’s “A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future?” Or perhaps how could one extend the recently re-published Marshall McLuhan article on the brain and the media that appears in “On the Nature of Media: Essays, 1952-1978?” In this regard, works like Valerie Porr’s excellent “Overcoming Borderline Personality Disorder” which goes in depth on one condition mentioned in Siegel’s book suggests some possibilities; emphasizing similar neurobiology and Dialectic Behavior Therapies, she indicates the pursuit of “wise mind” which combines “emotional mind” and “logical mind” as an effective synthesis.So to begin to understand the new brain science, its current and potential uses take a look at “Mindsight.”0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsGetting Your Mind RightBySteve Gladison June 1, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI believe that the heart of this book is embodied in a quote by Martin Luther King Jr. from the Letter from Birmingham Jail: "We are caught in the inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects us all indirectly."  Professor and psychiatrist Dan Siegel illustrates King’s words in action.  He explains how Mindsight helps us integrate and regulate the flow of energy and information both within ourselves and among others, while at the same time honoring differences and reshaping our own brains. The brain is a social organ and mindsight is about regulating and integrating emotional and social intelligence.  Indeed, knowing ourselves and sensing the inner world of others is uniquely human. Through mindful breathing and reflection, we can learn to “name and tame” our emotions rather than being consumed by and “becoming” those emotions. He proposes a triangle: Well-being = Mind + Brain + Relationships.0Comment|

For most of us, self-knowledge is immensely difficult to obtain and even more difficult to accept.  However, Socrates insists that the unexamined life is not worth living. All this is relevant to Daniel Siegel's latest book, Mindsight, in which he discusses the core principles and potential significance of "the new science of personal transformation," a process during which the brain creates itself or increases its capabilities "to promote physical, psychological, and interpersonal well-being."As Daniel Goleman correctly observes in an uncommonly enlightening Foreword, "Daniel Siegel's theory of mindsight -- the brain's capacity for both insight and empathy...makes sense for us out of the cluttered confusions of our sometimes maddening and messy emotions...Self-awareness and empathy are (along with self-mastery and social skills) domains of human ability essential for success in life...Of these four skills, self-awareness lays the foundation for the rest."There are several concepts or themes central to Siegel's narrative. For example, "The Triangle of Well-Being" reveals three aspects of our lives (i.e. relationships, mind, and brain) that "form the three mutual influencing points of the Triangle of Well-Bring." Mindsight enables us to become aware of, indeed monitor and modify "the flow of energy and information within the Triangle of Well-Being." Two others are "A Window of Tolerance" (see Pages 137-139 and 269-270) and "The Wheel of Awareness" (91-93 and 95-96). Siegel explains why Goleman is dead-on: "self-awareness lays the foundation for the rest." That is not to suggest, however, that one's self-awareness must be total before the expanded and enlightened mindsight can be applied. There are several reasons why I think this is so. Here are the two I think are most important: first, all human beings change (for better or worse) as does the potential self-knowledge to be obtained; the process of self-examination to which Socrates refers is endless until death. My second reason is that, over time, during our personal transformation, others will interact with us differently as will we with them and adjustments must be made, thereby increasing the number and quality of opportunities for gaining new, valuable insights about ourselves, of course, but also about human nature.These are among the dozens of passages that caught my eye:o  "Hand Model of the Brain" (Pages 14-22)o  "The Mechanism of Mindlessness" (26-30)o  "What Fires Together, Wires Together" (40-43)o  "A healthy Mind: Complexity and Self-Organization (68-69)o  "A Mindful Approach to Changing the Mind" (83-84)o  "Awareness Training and Stabilizing the Mind" (93-98)o  "Building Inner Resources" (135-137)o  "Patterns of Attachment" (167-171)o  "An Unresolved and Disorganized Mind" (182-188)o  "Top-Down and Bottom-Up" (200-203)o  "Making Sense of the Past to Free the Present" (217-220)Then in the Appendix, I especially appreciate the provision of  "a dozen basic concepts and related terms and ideas that form a foundation for our approach of mindsight, integration, and well-being" (267-270) followed by extensively annotated Notes (271-300). When review key points later, I would begin with these two sections.No brief commentary such as mind can possibly do full justice to the scope and depth of material that Siegel provides in this volume. I conclude with three points that are of special importance to me and will be, perhaps, to many others who read this brilliant book. First, our mind is what the brain does and the brain (viewed as a muscle) can be expanded and strengthened, with that process limited only by the nature and extent of our commitment to it. Second, the material Siegel provides has compelling and substantial importance to improving child development within and beyond their schools. Finally, I agree with Daniel Siegel that mindsight can allow us to "see the internal workings of our own minds," to be sure, but it can also help us to increase our understanding and appreciation others and -- through meaningful interaction with them -- increase their understanding and appreciation of us. That is indeed a compelling vision.0Comment|

Ferrarion July 21, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI so badly want to like Dr. Siegel's work (this is the 3rd book of his I've attempted to read). For the most part, I agree with the basic philosophical orientation and commitments that guide his writing, and the territory he keeps writing into from different angles (basically, the mind's significance and its connection to human well-being) is relevant and important. With this being said... I don't know how his books get published as they are absolutely painful to read. What I don't understand is that you can hire an editor to proof your work and help you organize and clarify your writing for a fair price. All three of his works that I've read suffer from the same basic stylistic writing deficiencies: redundancy (I could easily condense all three books that I've read into less than one book), odd/inaccessibly turn of phrase, and most of all, an absolutely dreadful lack of sustained conceptual focus, clarity, and organization. The biggest tragedy, in my opinion, is that because of his unresolved stylistic issues, the core idea(s) of his books remain inaccessible. It's like trying to walk somewhere beautiful with a map that's indirect at best and utterly incomprehensible at worst.Honestly, just read the summaries of his books or any reviews of them online and you'll have basically 90% of the book. Save yourself the $.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsMindsightBySteven M. Savlovon April 28, 2010Format: MP3 CD|Verified PurchaseI have read several other books authored by Dr. Siegel including the Developing Mind, The Mindful Mind and recently read Mindsight. As a neuropsychologist and clinical psychologist, I found the previous two books as well as Mindsight to be excellent in terms of bringing neuroscience and psychotherapy together in a very humanistic and readable manner. Many books about neuroscience are very technical and dry when it comes to practical application of science and theory. Dr. Siegel's presentation in Mindsight is very readable and practical with lots of wonderful examples of his thinking and the science behind his approach to psychotherapy which lets the reader adopt or adapt many of his strategies into their practice or their lives very easily. Even after 35 years of clinical practice, I have found that Dr. Siegel's approach has had a significant influence on how I conceptualize and understand my patients. I would highly recommend Mindsight to my colleagues and to my patients as I feel it would be very meaningful and useful to both.0Comment|

Description
Trauma Healing
Theory and Practice: An Interpersonal Neurobiological Approach Transforming Developmental Trauma into Integration and Resiliency.
Duration 10 hrs (approx).
An extraordinary resource for therapists, healers and anyone interested in the health of the whole person.
Eminent psychiatrist Dr Dan Siegel is a brilliant speaker and teacher, who through sincerity and authenticity, animatedly educates us on his ground-breaking discoveries regarding where mind, brain and relationships meet. This life changing recording explains how unresolved developmental trauma can impact not only our relationship with ourselves, but our relationship with those we love the most. Most importantly, his workshop helps us begin the profound journey moving toward healing, wholeness and relational intimacy.
Part one (5 hrs) is presented by Dr. Siegel providing theory, education and understanding. Part two is led by Khiron House’s clinical team showing how they work with traumatised people in the Khiron House Clinic. This is a great and practical complement to Dr Siegel’s talks and brings out important applied trauma theory.

A superb resource for those involved in healing and therapeutic work of all kinds: Counsellors, Psychotherapists, Craniosacral Therapists, CBT practitioners, Osteopaths and many others will find something profoundly supportive in this stunning and articulate presentation.

About:
Daniel J. Siegel, M.D. is currently clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine and the founding co-director of the Mindful Awareness Research Center. He is also the Executive Director of the Mindsight Institute, which offers online learning and in-person lectures that focus on how the development of mindsight in individuals, families and communities can be enhanced by examining the interface of human relationships and basic biological processes.

He serves as the Founding Editor for the Norton Professional Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology which contains over three dozen textbooks. Dr. Siegel’s books include Mindsight, Pocket Guide to Interpersonal Neurobiology, The Developing Mind, Second Edition, The Mindful Therapist, The Mindful Brain, Parenting from the Inside Out (with Mary Hartzell, M.Ed.), The New York Times bestsellers The Whole-Brain Child (with Tina Payne Bryson, Ph.D.), Brainstorm, and his latest No-Drama Discipline (with Tina Payne Bryson, Ph.D.).
Dr Siegel’s unique ability to make complicated scientific concepts exciting has led him to be invited to address diverse local, national and international groups of mental health professionals, neuroscientists, corporate leaders, educators, parents, public administrators, healthcare providers, policy-makers, mediators, judges, and clergy. He has lectured for the King of Thailand, Pope John Paul II, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Google University, London’s Royal Society of Arts (RSA), and TEDx.
