Looking to Expand, a Hollywood Agency Seeks a Financial Boost

LOS ANGELES — When talks over the Walt Disney Company’s attempted sale of Miramax Films bogged down last month, Bryan Lourd, a managing partner in the powerful Creative Artists Agency, jumped in.Mr. Lourd, who represented a bid organized by Bob and Harvey Weinstein and the investor Ron Burkle, worked phones, rattled cages, poured on charm when things got sticky and lobbied the Disney chief executive, Robert A. Iger — until talks fell apart, and Disney moved on to the next prospective buyer.It isn’t easy being a superagent these days.Mr. Lourd’s clients are behind perhaps a dozen of the biggest studio movies this year, like Robert Downey Jr. in “Iron Man 2” or Oliver Stone with his coming “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.” But Mr. Lourd, in close coordination with his business partners, has been pushing to expand Creative Artists — already heavily involved in the sports business — well beyond the confines of the entertainment industry, which has not been much fun of late, even for the big players.In the last few weeks, Mr. Lourd and his agency partners — Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett, David O’Connor, Rob Light and Steven Lafferty — have talked with potential investors, including the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG.

The idea is to form a financial alliance that might give Creative Artists backing for new ventures, whether in sports, video games or the sort of investment activities it has fostered through Evolution Media Capital, a satellite that represented the Weinstein-Burkle bid for Miramax.

The sale of a stake in the agency could also let its owners tap some of the wealth that has largely been locked inside their sprawling private business. But people briefed on the discussions — who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the agency’s stringent policy against public comment on its business — insisted that no managing partner was planning to leave.Hollywood’s top agencies have been under pressure for years, as an erosion in home video revenue, a drop in film production and fragmentation in the TV business have clipped income for stars and filmmakers and turned deals like the still-pending Miramax sale into bargaining quagmires.“The C.A.A. conversations are nothing more than a reflection of these realities,” said Peter Dekom, a longtime  entertainment lawyer.

For Mr. Lourd and his associates, a group of whom bought Creative Artists from its co-founders, Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer, in 1995, the challenge has been to keep their company from becoming a gilded cage that might shrink if it failed to connect with a larger business world.Mr. Lourd declined to be interviewed for this article. He has, however, unwillingly become the most public of his agency’s  private group of owners, in large part because of  an unsuccessful marriage to the actress and writer Carrie Fisher, who made their relationship grist for book projects, including her memoir and one-woman stage show, “Wishful Drinking.”Mr. Lourd, meanwhile, has emerged as a main strategist behind the agency’s search for new backing. Any deal with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG or another investor could still be months in the making.But talks toward what might elsewhere be seen as a ho-hum step in business expansion have been an attention-getter in Hollywood, perhaps because Creative Artists and its owners have been long cloistered in a world that revolves around the agency’s Century City headquarters.

Mr. Lourd, for instance, is virtually alone among the partners in having joined a major corporate board — that of IAC/Interactive Corporation, the Internet-oriented conglomerate led  by a Hollywood friend, Barry Diller.He also sticks out in Hollywood because of his humble background and down-to-earth demeanor. The son of an oil field worker, Mr. Lourd, now 49, grew up along the Bayou Teche, in New Iberia, La. He came to Los Angeles as a student at the University of Southern California, where he studied journalism and international relations after seeing the school advertised on television, according to friends.

While still in college, Mr. Lourd became a page at CBS Studios, on the game show “The Price Is Right” and the soap opera “The Young and the Restless” — and a show business career was born. In 1983, he joined the mailroom at the William Morris Agency.In a classic progression, Mr. Lourd quickly became an agent, was tagged as an up-and-comer, then jumped to the hotter Creative Artists in 1988.Ms. Fisher, born to Hollywood’s inner circle as the daughter of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, brought still deeper connections, though Mr. Lourd was already building a client list that  included Meryl Streep, Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.

Mr. Lourd joined his partners in 1999 in battling Mr. Ovitz, who had begun wooing clients to his new management company. Disinclined to share business with Mr. Ovitz, the agency said anyone he managed would be shut out of Creative Artists. (The Ovitz operation soon folded.)With Mr. Huvane primarily focused on talent relationships, Mr. Lourd and Mr. Lovett, who is the agency’s president and chief organizer, have at times appeared to be an operational committee of two at the top of Creative Artists, despite a group ethic that puts the partners on equal footing.Mr. Lovett has been known for a special interest in the agency’s foray  into sports marketing, as it recruited prominent agents who represent the likes of LeBron James and Peyton Manning. The initiative — now managed by Howard Nuchow, Michael Levine and Peter Kenyon but heavily overseen by Mr. O’Connor —  has led to tensions with the competing sports agency IMG.In April, IMG filed suit in a United States District Court in Ohio against Matthew Baldwin, a sports agent it accused of taking confidential files, including client contracts, when he recently quit to join Creative Artists.

Mr. Baldwin had already sued IMG in California, seeking to void contractual terms that would keep him from competing with it. The two courts are now sorting out where the cases will land, perhaps setting the stage for a battle that could touch Creative Artists, though it is not named as a party to either suit.Deep inside the movie business, at any rate, things sometimes still go the way they should for a top player.Engineering a new version of “The Karate Kid” for Sony Pictures Entertainment, for instance, was mostly a matter of getting one of Mr. Lourd’s own clients, the producer Jerry Weintraub, who made the original film, to talk with a client of Mr. Lovett’s, Will Smith.“He said don’t close your mind,” Mr. Weintraub said of Mr. Lourd’s role in brokering the deal behind a film that has taken in $107 million  at the domestic box office in its first 10 days.And Harvey Weinstein remains a believer, even if Miramax — for the moment — slipped off the hook.“He is a level-headed and fair negotiator,” Mr. Weinstein said of Mr. Lourd. “Bryan was an incredible force to have involved.”

Bryan Lourd, the most powerful man in Hollywood
Managing Director and Co-Chairman of Creative Artists Agency, which reps half of Hollywood stars. He was appointed to the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and to the  John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He was also the mediator between Writers Guild and DIsney exes during the infamous writers strike. He's also an out and proud gay.Basically, what do we know about him?by Anonymousreply 9812/29/2016


I'm sure he's an absolute delight and the picture of altruism.by Anonymousreply 111/10/2015

is that his husband on the right?by Anonymousreply 911/10/2015


The Herbert Ross troll said Lourd was known to be gay at the time that he married Carrie Fisher. In the late eighties many powerful gay men entered into beard marriages to distance themselves from the taint of the AIDS-ravaged gay community, the most significant being Calvin Klein.His partner Bruce Bozzi is an aging himbo who appears to be more in love with his best friend Andy Cohen than he does his actual partner.by Anonymousreply 1011/10/2015


Lourd also infamously told Carrie Fisher that her craziness turned him gay, although, again, per the HRT's anecdote, that was clearly not the case.by Anonymousreply 1111/10/2015


This is interesting. But does it mean Carrie was okay with marrying gay man? Why would she do that?by Anonymousreply 1211/10/2015

Isn't he bff with another DL fav, Simon Halls?by Anonymousreply 1411/10/2015


Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozziby Anonymousreply 1511/10/2015


Lourd and Halls were roommates at USC and have been close since, although I have heard Halls is more of a sycophant than bff.  When Amazing Amy personally emailed Halls to congratulate his husband Matt Bomer's performance after watching The Normal Heart, Halls replied, "I'm proud of Matt and Ryan but I'm REALLY proud of Bryan Lourd! He made this whole thing happen!"  We had fun with that one.Here is what HRT said Re Lourd and Fisher:Okay, here's what I don't get: this woman was Hollywood hipster before such a word existed, she was Hollywood royalty her whole life, she knew everyone... and NOBODY told her her soon to be husband was gay? Because I KNEW HE WAS GAY and I was just a pimple on the toe of show business. But not her? Know how I knew? My boss told me years before and not in some bitchy queen way either, just matter of fact, the guy was "family" and quite attractive. So if I (and I assume a few hundred other people) knew, then how could she not?by Anonymousreply 1611/10/2015

[R16] Thanks for clarifying that and posting the HRT's quote. I am always shocked by non-lesbian women who deliberately choose to enter bearding marriage. Were they even that close? I think not if he is openly criticizing her and blaming her illness for his sexual orientation.by Anonymousreply 2111/10/2015

She'd be in her 20's by now.The daughter is an actress, she is one of the 'Chanels' on Scream Queens. I know Lourd identifies as gay now but, with the whole wife and kid thing, wouldn't the most likely deduction be that he's a bisexual who prefers men.by Anonymousreply 2411/10/2015

"Lourd is supposedly an incredibly nice guy.'Hon, NO ONE gets to where he is in Hollywood by being an incredibly nice guy.  I'm sure he's as much a nasty barracuda as any of his peers.by Anonymousreply 4811/13/2015


I think that person meant nice as in "cool/charismatic" rather than "nice nice."The HRT said that the CAA guys had that reputation in the 80s, as opposed to the other hotheaded agencies.by Anonymousreply 4911/13/2015


Look, in Hollywood, they can stab you in the back and destroy you, but smile all the while. They are calm, and happy, and always, always "helpful." Guys like Bryan Lourd would be the fixer type, the problem solver, the guy who's gonna take care of you. He can be as unscrupulous as can be, but you won't see it. The guys who succeed are the ones who never telegraph their punches. You don't know your throat is slit until you nod your head.Dealing with actors, authors, directors, sports figures, singers, etc. these are all very insecure narcissistic people to varying degrees. Some are more needy than others. By being "nice" and being "a good listener" you learn things. People share information, they confide. Producers talk about how they need to find financing, etc. Sometimes a project can get sabotaged by being greenlighted.It's all very Alice in Wonderland. Nothing is as it appears, and no one says what they mean. The most effective ones are like Pacino's character in Scarface's memorable line: "I always tell the truth, even when I lie." The days of temper tantrums and moguls are over, the trend towards "Hollywood Nice" began in the late 60's -70's.  AMy PAscal is an example of someone who stupidly let her guard down with Rudin.  There are different rules for women. Rudin is an acknowledged asshole, but he is represented by a "nice guy" and his "Nice guy" has power.by Anonymousreply 5011/13/2015

I think 'nice' means he is pleasant, keeps his temper under control, is very intelligent and urbane. In his memoir Bryan's brother described how it was Bryan who let their impossible (and homophobic) father move in with him. The father became disabled and Bryan looked after him like a little kid despite how awful he had been to Bryan. Sounds like a good guy to me.by Anonymousreply 5411/13/2015

He lost all of his hair while conducting a scientific experiment with Superboy(Superman when he was a boy). Now he holds a bitter vendetta against the Man of Steel. He won't be satisfied until he crushes him. Rumor is that he has a contingent of workers searching Addis Ababa for a green meteor that might prove fatal to the world's greatest hero.by Anonymousreply 6012/27/2015


Billie accepted Debbie's honorary Oscar earlier this fall because Debbie was "ill".  Truth is, Debbie is suffering from dementia ( you could tell last year from her rambling speech during her SAG Life Achievement Award) and cannot be trusted to speak in public anymore.  Carrie keeps her at home while Billie is sent out as the family spokesperson now.  And did you see Billie in the new STAR WARS as the young Leia?by Anonymousreply 6112/27/2015

I've observed him as late as summer 2013 or 2014 in East Hampton....as a houseguest to someone not really in show biz. He sat around barely saying anything with a sad vacant look on his face.

Bryan's a decent guy. Stands out like an angel amongst those at his level in the agency business. He keeps a relatively low profile (you won't see him with 30 questionable West Hollywood skanks on a boat in Greece like Kevin), the husband's instagram thirst notwithstanding. But he and Kevin make a nice Power Gay Duo. Yin, yang, etc. They'll both cash out soon enough at CAA when the private equity money vests.by Anonymousreply 8110/31/2016

Bryan Lourd and partner Bruce Bozzi








Anne Hathaway, Sarah Jessica Parker, Gwyneth Paltrow, Daniel Craig and more feted the agent for his contributions to the arts, performing artists and New York's Lincoln Center.

He may be one of the most beloved men in Hollywood, but don't tell CAA's Bryan Lourd how much everyone loves him. And definitely don't try to give him an honor.
"I've resisted this for a long time," the ever modest superstar agent said to THR exclusively, at the beginning of cocktails at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall for the American Songbook Gala that honored him -- and raised $2.75 million dollars, twice as much as it ever has. "But I couldn't turn them down; it's a great institution and I couldn't say no. Am I embarrassed? Yes! Am I nervous about giving a speech? Yes! I will have a good time tonight -- when this is over, and I can just hang out with my friends. I have no idea what we're going to see tonight -- and I'm not sure I want to know! They kept it a complete surprise from me." Not an easy thing to do, particularly if you're represented by CAA.
And this man has a lot of friends. They came from Los Angeles (Warner Bros.' Sue Kroll and Blair Rich, both in Dolce & Gabbana), David Geffen, Barry Diller, Ron Meyer, Amy Pascal, Bryan's brother Blaine Lourd and wife Crystal Moffet Lourd (in chic Tom Ford white silk), Reese Witherspoon and Jim Toth, Matt Bomer and Simon Halls (Lourd's college roommate); from Louisiana (Lourd's proud mom, who flew in for a few days); and of course New York: Lourd was feted with a surprise performance organized by other CAA agents and by theater director Joe Mantello -- it featured Anne Hathaway, Sarah Jessica Parker, Alan Cumming, Broadway star Norbert Leo Butz, Marisa Tomei, Patricia Clarkson, Allison Williams, Ellen Barkin, Kristen Chenoweth, Andy Cohen, Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos. Matthew Broderick was on the playbill, but is shooting a film and could not get away, much to his regret. UTA client Gwyneth Paltrow was in the audience, in a chic, black, sequined cocktail dress with long sleeves. "I'm just a guest tonight!" she laughed. "I'm not singing in this crowd." Witherspoon also wore a black cocktail dress, a Valentino with an illusion neckline. "I'm loving everything Valentino does these days," she admitted. And Kevin Huvane, who runs CAA with Lourd, was patting everyone on the back. "Bryan is my brother," he pronounced in the most heartfelt way. It seemed to be the sentiment of the evening. Jimmy Fallon wafted through the crowd at the dinner after, only to be congratulatd every two seconds for his impending Tonight Show debut.
All the songs performed on stage Monday night were odes to Broadway and New York, with the event set in what was said to be a re-creation of Lourd's Manhattan penthouse. Who knew that one of film's and TV's biggest agents was such a theater lover? Turns out, he is a fan of show tunes, plays, musicals, the works. The actors on stage were all situated on sofas and divans, with a bartender bringing them cocktails as if they were late-night crooners in a New York jazz club (Maria's Crisis in the Village is apparently Lourd's fave). While those who can croon did: Hathaway, of course, but who knew Allison Williams could sing so well? Cummings performed a Broadway tune, as did Parker, but the biggest surprise of the night might have been Lourd's 21-year-old daughter, NYU student Billie Lourd (daughter of Lourd and Carrie Fisher, now blonde and long-legged), who sang a duet with Bomer, Neil Young's "Old Man." Word is, she's thinking of taking her obvious musical talent seriously when she gets out of school. Tomei spoke about Lourd living in her building in New York, and him being wise enough to read her soul in the elevator. "And Bryan," she added, "can I have a ride home tonight? If not, see you in the elevator."
"I am Ellen Barkin," said the actress, now a die-hard New Yorker, as she strode onto the stage in a chic black silk trousers and blouse ensemble. "And I am Bryan Lourd's best friend. Of course, he has many best friends. Everyone's his best friend. It would make me mad, if he wasn't so wonderful."
"I DO have a lot of best friends," Lourd admitted, after Daniel Craig presented him with his honor, after the songs were sung. "It's embarrassing. But I love all of them. I didn't want to do this, but I'm really glad I did."
A Louisiana-style dinner of shrimp and mac and cheese was served after, in the lobby of Alice Tully Hall.

Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts eyeing $250 mil stake in agency

So what about outside capital in your agency, CAA managing partner Bryan Lourd was asked Tuesday after news broke that Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts is in talks to buy a $250 million stake in the firm.Lourd more or less confirmed the talks with the investment firm while speaking at the Beverly Hills Hotel during a Summit on Luxury Goods sponsored by the Financial Times."There have been conversations," he told the 150 marketing and ad agency execs, though he never mentioned KKR by name. "It's premature to say. We've self-financed so far, and we did OK in the credit crunch."(Even so, all talent agencies have felt the downdraft from the recession and seen their commissions from talent deals squeezed. And in 2005, ICM ceded a substantial majority share in its fortunes to private equity player Rizvi Traverse.)Whatever the challenges of the representation biz, one thing Lourd did suggest more forcefully was that he and his partners would, as he put it, "never turn over control." "It is," Lourd went on, "the passion, the family we all chose, along with" -- he half-jokingly added -- "our other dysfunctional ones at home."Lourd also volunteered that many people in private equity and the investment community "who are much smarter than we are" could, if the right fit came along, play a role in expanding the sphere of the agency -- but always in a minority position. FT editor Lionel Barber did not press Lord on the issue, and the 45-minute conversation then shifted back to the topics at hand -- namely how major brands are increasingly getting in bed with Hollywood to get their messages across and how stars and celebrities are responding to these new challenges and opportunities.For one thing, Lourd pointed out, certain actors understand their responsibility toward those who invest in their art.In the old days, Lourd noted, "actors would go quietly off to Europe or Asia to do sponsorships or endorsements," but now they more fully understand the value of "real long-term partnerships with companies."Endorsements can further an actor's agenda. For companies, the need is for actors to be front and center, to have stock, to experience the product in order for the relationship to be authentic in the eyes of consumers. "The client has to really show up," Lourd said.As for other growth areas of the agenting business, Lourd put the accent on CAA's four-year-old expansion into the sports arena, which now includes representation of such athletes as Peyton Manning, Derek Jeter and LeBron James. To get that division going, CAA hustled to hire a passel of powerful sports agents from the sports rep firm IMG and started to put together sponsorship deals among athletes, corporate clients and sports teams."Like movie stars, top athletes want to know (from us) how to manage the business around their gift," he said. And that, he continued, involves extensions into other fields such as broadcast anchoring, philanthropy and real estate. The CAA partner also said there will be much more "back and forth" between the film world and the sports world, pointing to director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's recent deal with Nike, or between stars and products that reflect their passions and styles, as with George Clooney and Omega."Anyone who ghetto-izes any form of media is a fool. We've all got to throw away our playbook and start over," Lourd said.

Though the sight of Princess Leia in a gold bikini could make any gay geek question his sexuality, being married to Carrie Fisher apparently had the opposite effect on CAA superagent Bryan Lourd. The two were together for three years (he fathered Fisher's daughter Billie in 1992) before Lourd famously left Fisher for another man. Now, in her new memoir Wishful Drinking, Fisher claims that Lourd blamed her and her pill-popping ways for making him gay. Page Six has the excerpt:
"He told me later that I had turned him gay . . . by taking codeine again. And I said, 'You know, I never read that warning on the label.' I thought it said 'heavy machinery,' not homosexuality - turns out I could have been driving those tractors all along!' "
Sadly, our first reaction to the allegation — "That's so gay" — has been deemed verboten by Hillary Duff. Instead, then, we wonder whether Lourd's "gay pill" theory could explain all those Tylenol PM sponsorships at gay events: it's all a master plan by the pharmaceutical industry to keep us queer! Diabolical — and fabulous.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
