SAN DIEGO, Aug. 11, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apricus Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq:APRI), a biopharmaceutical company advancing innovative medicines to meet the needs of patients, today announced the appointment of Sandford D. Smith to the Company's Board of Directors. Mr. Smith brings a wealth of senior management and board level experience from his leadership roles in both the biotech and pharmaceutical industries with leading companies such as Genzyme and Bristol-Meyers Squibb. Under Mr. Smith's leadership of Genzyme's international business, international revenues approached $3 billion, growing from a modest base to represent more than 65% of Genzyme's total sales. His appointment to the Apricus Board of Directors is effective immediately.

	"We are extremely pleased to further strengthen our board with Sandy, who has had vast experience creating strategic value for life science companies at both the operating and board levels. Sandy's successful track record, most recently at Genzyme, includes overseeing the launch of twelve new products in various therapeutic areas, substantial global business development experience, and extensive service as a public company board member," said Kleanthis G. Xanthopoulos, Ph.D., Chairman of the Board.

	Mr. Smith stated, "I am looking forward to participating as a member of the Apricus Board during this exciting time with the Company's first commercial partner launches and sales of Vitaros in the international markets. My focus always has been on the intersection of clinical development and commercial activities, and I look forward to working with the Apricus Board and management team to achieve commercial success."

	For almost four decades, Mr. Smith has been actively engaged in the development of the international business for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.  Most recently, Mr. Smith served as President, International Group, and Executive Vice President of Genzyme Corporation, until the company's acquisition by Sanofi in 2011, after which he worked with Sanofi on the design and integration of the international business into Sanofi's global organization. Mr. Smith joined Genzyme in 1996, and initially served as Vice President and General Manager of Genzyme International and President of Genzyme Specialty Therapeutics.

	As President of the International Group, he oversaw the successful launch of twelve new products in the therapeutic categories of genetic lysosomal disorders, oncology, renal disease, and biomaterials for surgical indications in markets around the world.

	Prior to joining Genzyme, Mr. Smith was President and Chief Executive Officer at Repligen Corporation, a publicly traded biotechnology company, from 1986-1995. Mr. Smith previously held leadership positions at Bristol-Myers Squibb from 1977-1985, including Director of Operations for Bristol-Myers Squibb–Asia Pacific and Vice President of Business Development and Strategic Planning for the Pharmaceutical and Nutritional Division. For the last two years, Mr. Smith has been advising publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies on developing successful global strategies, including M&A, in the orphan/rare disease space. He currently serves on the Boards of Directors of Cytokinetics, Inc., Aegerion Pharmaceuticals and Neuralstem, Inc. He is on the advisory council for Brigham & Women's Hospital, where he created the Smith Scholars Residency in medical education to benefit physicians from the resource-poor nations.

We assume no obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Also during this call, we will discuss non-GAAP operating results and guidance. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP operating results and guidance is addressed in today's earnings release.At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Aegerion's CEO, Sandy Smith.Sandford D. Smith - Interim Chief Executive OfficerHi, everyone and thank you very much for joining today. I'd like to ask you to turn the page to the next chapter in Aegerion's journey. Having served on the board since 2012, I'm pleased to have the opportunity to lead Aegerion into this next stage of our mission, which remains the same as before, and that is to bring innovative therapies to patients with debilitating rare diseases. With the resources we have in place, we have the opportunity to successfully transition Aegerion to its next phase of growth. On my watch, I'd like to articulate some of the objectives that I will be pursuing with the management group.Number one, continuing to optimize the U.S. business for both of our products. Number two, expanding our global footprint through entering into new international markets. Number three, gaining reimbursement in European markets for lomitapide. And number four, deepening our product pipeline through both lifecycle management of existing assets balanced appropriately with business development activities. Ultimately, we believe success in any one of these areas has the potential of driving value for all of you, and I do plan to execute. I look forward to meeting with you personally in the near future as we can talk about the progress of moving towards these goals.So turning to slide three, what excites me as I contemplate the growth opportunities for Aegerion is a highly capable team and a supporting infrastructure that can be leveraged to support additional products. While managing through significant learnings about JUXTAPID in HoFH, we're proud to have successfully launched our second product MYALEPT. This enables us to leverage the people, processes, and systems already in place. And this leverage is important to us, particularly, as we bring a second product to our sales force existing both in the United States and in international markets.We're off to a strong start with MYALEPT. We continue to believe that the acquisition of MYALEPT was a sound, strategic decision. With significant growth in MYALEPT net product sales in the U.S., we made good progress in opening a new market for the treatment of generalized lipodystrophy. The product, as we expected, is behaving like a classic orphan drug as compared to JUXTAPID. The symptomatic nature of generalized lipodystrophy and the distinguished physical characteristics help to identify GL patients and create quite a predictable market. The challenge for MYALEPT is patient identification, and this is in our wheelhouse. With a leadership team and a sales force that brings significant orphan drug business experience, we're well positioned to grow MYALEPT.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com
