Aeglea BioTherapeutics Announces Leadership Change
Anthony Quinn, M.B Ch.B, Ph.D., Aeglea board member, former head of R&D at Synageva BioPharma, named interim CEO



















July 20, 2017 16:01 ET

 | Source: Aeglea BioTherapeutics






AUSTIN, Texas, July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGLE), a biotechnology company committed to developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism to treat rare genetic diseases and cancer, today announced that David G. Lowe, Ph.D., resigned as the company’s president, chief executive officer and director, effective immediately. Anthony Quinn, M.B Ch.B, Ph.D., has been appointed to serve as interim chief executive officer while the company conducts a comprehensive search for a permanent chief executive officer. Dr. Quinn has played a significant role in the leadership of Aeglea. He has been a member of the board of directors since 2016 and recently served as interim chief medical officer. With more than 20 years’ experience in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, Dr. Quinn has an accomplished track record as a drug developer. He served as head of R&D and chief medical officer at Synageva BioPharma Corp. until the company’s acquisition by Alexion Pharmaceuticals in 2015. During his tenure at Synageva, he played a key role in securing European and U.S. approvals of Kanuma™ for Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency and in building the company’s research and development organization and rare disease drug pipeline. Prior to Synageva, he was head of clinical research and exploratory development at Roche, which included leadership responsibility for the inflammation disease portfolio including the MabtheraTM, RituxanTM and ActemraTM programs. “In addition to his seasoned leadership, Anthony brings broad experience in drug development, particularly in rare genetic disease. This will be critical to Aeglea’s future success as we continue to advance our preclinical and clinical pipeline,” said Armen Shanafelt, Ph.D., chairman of Aeglea’s board of directors. “With our strong management team, we are confident Anthony will provide continuity of leadership while we undergo a search for a permanent CEO.” Dr. Shanafelt added, “It has been a privilege to work with David and I’d like to thank him for all that he has accomplished with Aeglea over the last several years through his hard work and passion for the company. We wish him well on the next phase of his career.” Under Dr. Lowe’s leadership, Aeglea progressed from a preclinical-stage to a clinical-stage company, with three ongoing clinical trials in rare genetic disease and cancer. He played a key role in securing institutional financing for Aeglea, including a successful initial public offering in 2016. “It has been an honor to work with the team at Aeglea,” said Dr. Lowe. “I am proud that we have established such a strong foundation to further Aeglea’s mission of providing new therapies that address unmet needs in rare genetic diseases and cancer.” About Aeglea BioTherapeutics Aeglea is a biotechnology company committed to developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism to treat rare genetic diseases and cancer. The company’s engineered human enzymes are designed to modulate the extremes of amino acid metabolism in the blood to reduce toxic levels of amino acids in inborn errors of metabolism or target tumor metabolism for cancer treatment. AEB1102, Aeglea’s lead product candidate, is currently being studied in two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS). Additionally, Aeglea is recruiting patients into its ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of AEB1102 for the treatment of patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency. The company is building a pipeline of additional product candidates targeting key amino acids, including AEB4104, which degrades homocystine, a target for an inborn error of metabolism, as well as two potential treatments for cancer, AEB3103, which degrades cysteine/cystine, and AEB2109, which degrades methionine.

AUSTIN, Texas, July  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc., (NASDAQ:AGLE) a biotechnology company committed to developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism to treat rare genetic diseases and cancer, today announced that it has appointed James Wooldridge, M.D. to the position of chief medical officer.
Dr. Wooldridge joins Aeglea from Eli Lilly & Company, where he served as chief scientific officer for immuno-oncology clinical development. Since 2006, he held a number of other roles at Eli Lilly, including senior medical director for oncology, U.S. medical affairs and clinical development. Prior to his time at Eli Lilly, Dr. Wooldridge was assistant professor at the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center Division of Hematology, Oncology Blood & Marrow Transplantation at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.
"We are pleased that Jim has decided to join our team in this critical role. His impressive clinical background will be a welcome addition as we execute on our clinical strategy for AEB1102 and continue advancing our pipeline," said David G. Lowe, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Aeglea. "With his expertise in drug development and translational medicine, we look forward to the insights and leadership he will bring to help advance the AEB1102 program with the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial for Arginase 1 Deficiency and the anticipated initiation of expansion arms of our oncology clinical trials. We are also grateful to Dr. Anthony Quinn for his support and leadership as our interim chief medical officer over the last several months and look forward to continuing our work with him as a member of Aeglea's board of directors."
"I look forward to working with the Aeglea team to unlock the potential of engineered human enzymes, with the goal of introducing new treatment options for patients with rare genetic diseases or cancer who currently have very limited therapeutic options," said Dr. Wooldridge. "Aeglea has a dynamic pipeline and an encouraging lead product candidate in AEB1102. From the unanticipated preclinical data suggesting the prospect of combination therapy in cancer, to the Phase 1 clinical data in Arginase 1 Deficiency showing promise for helping patients with this rare disease, I believe there is great potential for Aeglea's pipeline of product candidates."
Dr. Wooldridge holds a bachelor's degree in chemistry and philosophy from William Jewell College, received his M.D. from Tulane University and has authored numerous manuscripts, book chapters, and congress disclosures. 
About Aeglea BioTherapeutics
Aeglea is a biotechnology company committed to developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism to treat rare genetic diseases and cancer. The company's engineered human enzymes are designed to modulate the extremes of amino acid metabolism in the blood to reduce toxic levels of amino acids in inborn errors of metabolism or target tumor metabolism for cancer treatment. AEB1102, Aeglea's lead product candidate, is currently being studied in two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS). Additionally, Aeglea is recruiting patients into its ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of AEB1102 for the treatment of patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency. The company is building a pipeline of additional product candidates targeting key amino acids, including AEB4104, which degrades homocystine, a target for an inborn error of metabolism, as well as two potential treatments for cancer, AEB3103, which degrades cysteine, and its oxidized form cystine, and AEB2109, which degrades methionine.

Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. announced that it has appointed James Wooldridge, M.D. to the position of chief medical officer. Dr. Wooldridge joins Aeglea from Eli Lilly & Company, where he served as chief scientific officer for immuno-oncology clinical development. Since 2006, he held a number of other roles at Eli Lilly, including senior medical director for oncology, U.S. medical affairs and clinical development.


Aeglea Biotherapeutics, Inc. Provides an AEB1102 Program
May 23 17
Aeglea BioTherapeutics Inc. provided an AEB1102 program. AEB1102, the company’s lead investigational molecule, is an engineered human enzyme designed to degrade the amino acid arginine and is being developed to treat two extremes of arginine metabolism. Aeglea is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in cancer patients with advanced solid tumors to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AEB1102, which has demonstrated clinical proof of mechanism. The trial is designed to include a dose escalation phase to determine maximum tolerated dose and an expansion phase to obtain additional single agent data in specific tumor types. Aeglea has selected three single agent solid tumor expansion arms: cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma and small cell lung cancer, all of which have been shown in studies to demonstrate a dependence on arginine. The primary endpoint of the expansion arms is to assess safety in patients with specific tumor types. Secondary endpoints include assessment of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical response. Each expansion arm will enroll up to 12 patients and are planned to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2017 or first quarter of 2018, following completion of the dose escalation phase. In March 2017, the Company received an information request from the United States Food and Drug Administration that additional data may be needed to support the inclusion of pediatric patients in the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial in Arginase 1 Deficiency. The Company recently received written feedback from the FDA based on supporting data provided in March and a follow-up meeting with the Agency in late April. To date, Aeglea has received two Institutional Review Board approvals for the Phase 1/2 protocol in the United States, and has an open Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in Canada which includes treatment of both adult and pediatric patients.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Description




Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company, which is engaged in the development of enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism to treat inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and cancer. The Company's product pipeline includes AEB1102, AEB3103, AEB2109 and AEB4104. Its lead product candidate, AEB1102, is engineered to degrade the amino acid arginine and is being developed to treat over two extremes of arginine metabolism, including arginine excess in patients with Arginase I deficiency, an IEM, as well as some cancers, which have shown to have a metabolic dependence on arginine. AEB1102 reduces blood arginine levels in nonclinical and oncology clinical studies. AEB3103 targets the degradation of the amino acid cysteine/cystine. AEB2109 targets the degradation of the amino acid methionine. AEB4104 targets the reduction of elevated levels of the amino acid homocystine associated with the IEM classical homocystinuria.

Rare Genetic Diseases
Focusing on modulating the extremes of amino acid metabolism, we use novel engineered human enzymes to reduce amino acid toxicity in the blood. For patients with rare genetic diseases (like Arginase I deficiency) who currently have limited treatment options, we believe in a better future through enzyme therapy.
