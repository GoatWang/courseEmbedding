Discover How to Buy a Business with Little to None of Your Own Money! 


Learn how you can get 100% funding to buy a business. Not like real estate investing or stock trading, but the business of your dreams — like a coffee shop, hair salon, spa,  retail store, auto shop, liquor store, restaurant, sports bar, etc.






 



93% of small business funding is rejected by banks. Banks overwhelmingly say “No” to small business loan requests. However, just because a bank won’t fund a deal doesn’t mean there is no startup business funding or business credit available for that deal. Since 2003, Ed Keels and his staff at Beyond Breakeven, Inc. (BBI) have been helping people with deal structures that provide business funding and business credit when banks won’t. In fact, BBI has developed more than 100 ways to fund a business acquisition or startup and do so with little to none of the buyer’s own money.
