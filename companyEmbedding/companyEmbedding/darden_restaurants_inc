History[edit]




The company's former logo, used until 2009.


What would come to be known as Darden Restaurants, began when William (Bill) Darden, age 19 opened his first restaurant, The Green Frog, in Waycross, Georgia, in 1938. He later founded the Red Lobster Inns of America and opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968.[6] Darden chose Lakeland because he wished to see how a seafood restaurant would fare in a non-coastal region, and Lakeland was the innermost city in Florida. The initial Red Lobster franchise was applauded by diners and critics alike. The store became successful and by 1970 had expanded to three locations in the state with two more under construction. While the locations were profitable, the company lacked the resources to expand further, so Darden sold the company to food giant General Mills that year.[7]
General Mills ownership[edit]
General Mills upgraded the chain to a more casual dining/family fare oriented format, opened a new company headquarters in Orlando and retained Darden as company manager. In 1975, when Darden was promoted to Vice President of General Mills, Joseph (Joe) R. Lee, the company's first restaurant manager, was promoted as President of Red Lobster. Under General Mills ownership, Red Lobster expanded into a chain of almost 400 locations by 1985. The company underwent several restructurings and transformed itself from an inexpensive fast-food seller into a chain of casual dining seafood restaurants by 1988.[7]
One of the company's first ventures into the diversification of its portfolio was the York Steak House chain of English-themed steak and chop restaurants in the 1970s. The franchised steak and potatoes restaurant was a cafeteria-style restaurant with salad bar and hot station. By the end of the 1980s, the chain had been mostly closed down, though some independent locations still exist. These places were very similar to a Ruby Tuesdays® now.[8][9]
In 1982, Darden opened the first Olive Garden concept store in Orlando. The chain took off, and by 1989 General Mills had opened over 145 stores, making the chain the fastest-growing unit in the company's restaurant holdings. While Olive Garden did not meet critical success, it was popular, and its per-store sales soon grew to match those of Red Lobster. The company eventually became the largest chain of Italian-themed full-service restaurants in the United States.[7]
In 1990, China Coast was launched as an attempt to create a (U.S.) national casual dining restaurant that featured American Chinese cuisine. While the chain eventually expanded to some 50 restaurants, its sales were lackluster and lost an estimated $20 million USD. By the end of 1995, the company was shuttered, and the remaining locations were either converted to Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens or closed altogether.[7][10]
Darden[edit]
In 1995, General Mills decided to spin off its restaurant chains to focus on consumer food products. The new company was named Darden Restaurants, after Red Lobster's founder. General Mills stockholders received one share of Darden for every common share of General Mills held. General Mills restaurants had $108 million net income in that year. At the end of 1995, Darden operated 1,250 restaurants in 49 states with 73 locations in Canada.[7]
Darden Restaurants was spun off from General Mills beginning on May 9, 1995, when it began trading on when-issue basis at $9.75 a share.[11] The company became a fully separate entity on May 31, 1995, when its shares went on sale on the NYSE. The shares opened at $10.75, 17% below expectations, but climbed to $11.125 by the close of trading.[12]
Darden executives planned to have two additional chains in place by 1998. In March 1996, Darden launched a test of Bahama Breeze Caribbean Grille concept featuring food and drinks found in the islands of the Caribbean Sea and a Caribbean theme, was created in 1996.[7]
Markets were over saturated with restaurants in 1997 forcing Darden to close 48 poor performing locations and lose $91 million due to the restructuring. Red Lobster and Olive Garden were given make overs in 1998. Darden also made a profit of $102 million that year.[7]
1999 saw Darden opening additional location after recovering from the 1996-1997 losses. The company then began testing a new concept entitled Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar that opened in late 1999 in Orlando. The restaurant is a sports bar concept featuring barbecue and related foodstuffs in an Appalachian mountain-lodge setting.[7]
In 2003, Seasons 52 was under development with the idea of "provide guests the opportunity to indulge while still eating well." Season 52 were only being opened in the Florida or Atlanta markets during its initial phase.[13]
Darden announced in January 2007 that the company was willing to expand by purchasing an existing 100 location chains even considering franchisors.[14] By May, Darden indicated that its Smokey Bones division would be sold and or shut down including the two Rocky River Grillhouse, the proposed replacement concept for Smokey Bones.[15] In August, Darden acquired rival Atlanta-based restaurant holder Rare Hospitality for $1.4 billion USD, gaining Rare's two chains, The Capital Grille and LongHorn Steakhouse. As part of the Rare acquisition, Darden set up its Specialty Restaurant Group to include Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52.[16] In December, Darden announced that it would sell its Smokey Bones chain to Barbeque Integrated, Inc., an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for approximately $80 million. The sale was completed in January, 2008.[6][17]
Expansion and ownership changes[edit]
In 2010, Seasons 52 started a new expansion phase opening up in 11 more states over the next three years.[13]
In January 2011, Darden announced co-locating their Olive Garden and Red Lobster brands in smaller markets to share kitchen but continue separate menus and eating areas.[18] As part of the February Darden analyst conference, an analyst indicated that the corporation may be targeting another restaurant chain for acquisition possibly one of BJ's, California Pizza Kitchen or Yard House.[19] In October 2011, Darden acquired 2 chains, Eddie V’s Prime Seafood and Wildfish Seafood Grille, for $59 million cash transaction and were placed within its Specialty Restaurant Group,[20] Also In October, Darden signed an area-development agreement with Americana Group of Kuwait to develop and operate at least 60 locations using the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse concepts.[21]
In July 2012, Darden acquired the Yard House 39 location beer-centric chain for $585 million from TSG Consumer Partners. Yard House will be alongside the other upscale restaurants in Darden's Specialty Restaurant Group.[22] On December 23, 2013, Darden's stock rose 3 percent after activist investor Starboard Value, a hedge fund, took a stake in the company.[23]
Red Lobster sale[edit]
On December 19, 2013, Darden announced plans to sell or spin-off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors.[24] This was in direct response to the company spending US$100 million on a new digital platform. At the time, the project was already at least one year behind schedule and above budget. A large number of layoffs occurred in its marketing department, and the company's second in command also left.[25]
On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of the spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations.[26] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion.[27] Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Differences between Starboard and Darden management soon emerged over the hedge fund's proposal to split the company in two and spin off a third to handle their real estate portfolio, a move Starboard said would greatly boost shareholder value. Matters came to head when management announced a plan to spin off the underperforming Red Lobster early in 2014. Starboard led a large group of investors in asking management to delay the move and see if better options, such as its plans to revitalize the chain, were available.[29] When management instead decided to sell the chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital in May, Starboard and other investors sharply criticized the $2.1 billion "fire sale" price as a serious undervaluing of Red Lobster and its assets such as the underlying real estate. It also claimed management had refused shareholders' requests for a special meeting to discuss the deal.[30]
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis, Jr. announced he would be resigning at the end of the year, the same day the Red Lobster sale was complete.[31] Management said afterwards that it would work on a needed turnaround plan for Olive Garden, also struggling. However, after CNBC reported on a leaked document, supposedly offered to potential lenders and buyers earlier in the year, that described Red Lobster's financial position far more optimistically than management had in its contemporary public statements,[32] one of the investors, a union pension fund, filed suit alleging material misrepresentation.[33] Management claimed the document had been prepared by Golden Gate in consultation with Red Lobster's executives, who could have been expected to have that view of the chain's future.[32] Eugene Lee was named permanent CEO on February 23, 2015, after serving as interim CEO in October 2014.[34]
Starboard assembled its own slate of directors to challenge all the sitting board members in the company's upcoming shareholder elections. In support of their candidacy it released a 294-slide presentation in early September about how the company had gone wrong and how its directors would restore it to health. While it received considerable media attention for its detailed focus on Olive Garden, in particular the chain's "wasteful" practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once (to prevent food waste due to staleness: instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table; additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand) and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots, it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chain's corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did.[35][36] Management responded two days later that it was already implementing many of the suggested changes, and said the free breadsticks merely represented "Italian generosity."[37] Nevertheless, in October, shareholders replaced the entire board with Starboard's slate, in what an observer called an "epic fail" for management, since that rarely happens.[38]
On March 27, 2017, Darden announced its intent to acquire Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million[39] from shareholders such as L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. On March 28, 2017, when Darden announced it that had acquired Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen and "lifted its full-year earnings outlook," the company became the biggest gainer that day on the S&P 500, with shares growing nearly 9 percent.[40] The acquisition was completed on April 24, 2017.[41]

History[edit]




The company's former logo, used until 2009.


What would come to be known as Darden Restaurants, began when William (Bill) Darden, age 19 opened his first restaurant, The Green Frog, in Waycross, Georgia, in 1938. He later founded the Red Lobster Inns of America and opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968.[6] Darden chose Lakeland because he wished to see how a seafood restaurant would fare in a non-coastal region, and Lakeland was the innermost city in Florida. The initial Red Lobster franchise was applauded by diners and critics alike. The store became successful and by 1970 had expanded to three locations in the state with two more under construction. While the locations were profitable, the company lacked the resources to expand further, so Darden sold the company to food giant General Mills that year.[7]
General Mills ownership[edit]
General Mills upgraded the chain to a more casual dining/family fare oriented format, opened a new company headquarters in Orlando and retained Darden as company manager. In 1975, when Darden was promoted to Vice President of General Mills, Joseph (Joe) R. Lee, the company's first restaurant manager, was promoted as President of Red Lobster. Under General Mills ownership, Red Lobster expanded into a chain of almost 400 locations by 1985. The company underwent several restructurings and transformed itself from an inexpensive fast-food seller into a chain of casual dining seafood restaurants by 1988.[7]
One of the company's first ventures into the diversification of its portfolio was the York Steak House chain of English-themed steak and chop restaurants in the 1970s. The franchised steak and potatoes restaurant was a cafeteria-style restaurant with salad bar and hot station. By the end of the 1980s, the chain had been mostly closed down, though some independent locations still exist. These places were very similar to a Ruby Tuesdays® now.[8][9]
In 1982, Darden opened the first Olive Garden concept store in Orlando. The chain took off, and by 1989 General Mills had opened over 145 stores, making the chain the fastest-growing unit in the company's restaurant holdings. While Olive Garden did not meet critical success, it was popular, and its per-store sales soon grew to match those of Red Lobster. The company eventually became the largest chain of Italian-themed full-service restaurants in the United States.[7]
In 1990, China Coast was launched as an attempt to create a (U.S.) national casual dining restaurant that featured American Chinese cuisine. While the chain eventually expanded to some 50 restaurants, its sales were lackluster and lost an estimated $20 million USD. By the end of 1995, the company was shuttered, and the remaining locations were either converted to Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens or closed altogether.[7][10]
Darden[edit]
In 1995, General Mills decided to spin off its restaurant chains to focus on consumer food products. The new company was named Darden Restaurants, after Red Lobster's founder. General Mills stockholders received one share of Darden for every common share of General Mills held. General Mills restaurants had $108 million net income in that year. At the end of 1995, Darden operated 1,250 restaurants in 49 states with 73 locations in Canada.[7]
Darden Restaurants was spun off from General Mills beginning on May 9, 1995, when it began trading on when-issue basis at $9.75 a share.[11] The company became a fully separate entity on May 31, 1995, when its shares went on sale on the NYSE. The shares opened at $10.75, 17% below expectations, but climbed to $11.125 by the close of trading.[12]
Darden executives planned to have two additional chains in place by 1998. In March 1996, Darden launched a test of Bahama Breeze Caribbean Grille concept featuring food and drinks found in the islands of the Caribbean Sea and a Caribbean theme, was created in 1996.[7]
Markets were over saturated with restaurants in 1997 forcing Darden to close 48 poor performing locations and lose $91 million due to the restructuring. Red Lobster and Olive Garden were given make overs in 1998. Darden also made a profit of $102 million that year.[7]
1999 saw Darden opening additional location after recovering from the 1996-1997 losses. The company then began testing a new concept entitled Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar that opened in late 1999 in Orlando. The restaurant is a sports bar concept featuring barbecue and related foodstuffs in an Appalachian mountain-lodge setting.[7]
In 2003, Seasons 52 was under development with the idea of "provide guests the opportunity to indulge while still eating well." Season 52 were only being opened in the Florida or Atlanta markets during its initial phase.[13]
Darden announced in January 2007 that the company was willing to expand by purchasing an existing 100 location chains even considering franchisors.[14] By May, Darden indicated that its Smokey Bones division would be sold and or shut down including the two Rocky River Grillhouse, the proposed replacement concept for Smokey Bones.[15] In August, Darden acquired rival Atlanta-based restaurant holder Rare Hospitality for $1.4 billion USD, gaining Rare's two chains, The Capital Grille and LongHorn Steakhouse. As part of the Rare acquisition, Darden set up its Specialty Restaurant Group to include Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52.[16] In December, Darden announced that it would sell its Smokey Bones chain to Barbeque Integrated, Inc., an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for approximately $80 million. The sale was completed in January, 2008.[6][17]
Expansion and ownership changes[edit]
In 2010, Seasons 52 started a new expansion phase opening up in 11 more states over the next three years.[13]
In January 2011, Darden announced co-locating their Olive Garden and Red Lobster brands in smaller markets to share kitchen but continue separate menus and eating areas.[18] As part of the February Darden analyst conference, an analyst indicated that the corporation may be targeting another restaurant chain for acquisition possibly one of BJ's, California Pizza Kitchen or Yard House.[19] In October 2011, Darden acquired 2 chains, Eddie V’s Prime Seafood and Wildfish Seafood Grille, for $59 million cash transaction and were placed within its Specialty Restaurant Group,[20] Also In October, Darden signed an area-development agreement with Americana Group of Kuwait to develop and operate at least 60 locations using the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse concepts.[21]
In July 2012, Darden acquired the Yard House 39 location beer-centric chain for $585 million from TSG Consumer Partners. Yard House will be alongside the other upscale restaurants in Darden's Specialty Restaurant Group.[22] On December 23, 2013, Darden's stock rose 3 percent after activist investor Starboard Value, a hedge fund, took a stake in the company.[23]
Red Lobster sale[edit]
On December 19, 2013, Darden announced plans to sell or spin-off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors.[24] This was in direct response to the company spending US$100 million on a new digital platform. At the time, the project was already at least one year behind schedule and above budget. A large number of layoffs occurred in its marketing department, and the company's second in command also left.[25]
On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of the spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations.[26] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion.[27] Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Differences between Starboard and Darden management soon emerged over the hedge fund's proposal to split the company in two and spin off a third to handle their real estate portfolio, a move Starboard said would greatly boost shareholder value. Matters came to head when management announced a plan to spin off the underperforming Red Lobster early in 2014. Starboard led a large group of investors in asking management to delay the move and see if better options, such as its plans to revitalize the chain, were available.[29] When management instead decided to sell the chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital in May, Starboard and other investors sharply criticized the $2.1 billion "fire sale" price as a serious undervaluing of Red Lobster and its assets such as the underlying real estate. It also claimed management had refused shareholders' requests for a special meeting to discuss the deal.[30]
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis, Jr. announced he would be resigning at the end of the year, the same day the Red Lobster sale was complete.[31] Management said afterwards that it would work on a needed turnaround plan for Olive Garden, also struggling. However, after CNBC reported on a leaked document, supposedly offered to potential lenders and buyers earlier in the year, that described Red Lobster's financial position far more optimistically than management had in its contemporary public statements,[32] one of the investors, a union pension fund, filed suit alleging material misrepresentation.[33] Management claimed the document had been prepared by Golden Gate in consultation with Red Lobster's executives, who could have been expected to have that view of the chain's future.[32] Eugene Lee was named permanent CEO on February 23, 2015, after serving as interim CEO in October 2014.[34]
Starboard assembled its own slate of directors to challenge all the sitting board members in the company's upcoming shareholder elections. In support of their candidacy it released a 294-slide presentation in early September about how the company had gone wrong and how its directors would restore it to health. While it received considerable media attention for its detailed focus on Olive Garden, in particular the chain's "wasteful" practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once (to prevent food waste due to staleness: instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table; additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand) and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots, it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chain's corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did.[35][36] Management responded two days later that it was already implementing many of the suggested changes, and said the free breadsticks merely represented "Italian generosity."[37] Nevertheless, in October, shareholders replaced the entire board with Starboard's slate, in what an observer called an "epic fail" for management, since that rarely happens.[38]
On March 27, 2017, Darden announced its intent to acquire Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million[39] from shareholders such as L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. On March 28, 2017, when Darden announced it that had acquired Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen and "lifted its full-year earnings outlook," the company became the biggest gainer that day on the S&P 500, with shares growing nearly 9 percent.[40] The acquisition was completed on April 24, 2017.[41]

Company Perspectives:

We take pride in providing a terrific dining experience to every guest, every time, in every one of our restaurants. That is how we will be the best company in the casual dining industry, now and for generations.
History of Darden Restaurants, Inc.








Operating more than 1,168 units throughout the United States and Canada, Darden Restaurants, Inc. began its existence in 1995 as the world's largest full-service restaurant organization, occupying the casual dining niche between fine dining and quick-service restaurants. Specifically, the company was spun off from General Mills to its stockholders as an independent company, overseeing the restaurant chains Red Lobster, The Olive Garden, and, until late 1995, China Coast.
Founded in 1968 and acquired by General Mills, Inc. in 1970, Red Lobster grew to become the nation's largest seafood and casual dining restaurant chain. Launched in 1982, The Olive Garden became the largest chain of casual but full-service Italian restaurants. China Coast was an unsuccessful ethnic restaurant chain that operated during the 1990s. Darden Restaurants' two newest concepts, Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar, were introduced in the late 1990s and together had 30 restaurants in operation by 2001. Controlling nearly 8.5 percent of the $47 billion casual dining market, Darden Restaurants served approximately 3,000,000 meals per year through its restaurant outlets.

The First Red Lobsters in the Late 1960s

William B. Darden, reared in Waycross, Georgia, opened, at the age of 19, a Depression-era Waycross lunch counter that he called "The Green Frog," promising "Service with a Hop." He went on to own some local motel and hotel properties and all or part of about 20 Howard Johnson restaurants. Inspired by the great popularity of seafood in two of his eight restaurants--one in Orlando and the other in Jacksonville--Darden opened his first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968. Its manager was Joe R. Lee, a native Georgian who later became chief executive officer of Darden Restaurants.
Darden wanted to market a chain of moderately priced, family-style, full-service seafood restaurants. He chose to open in Lakeland because it was as far from the ocean as possible in Florida, and he wanted to test his concept outside of coastal areas. The first Red Lobster proved a booming success, so much so that Darden and his partners had to work full shifts to meet the objective of getting food to the table within ten minutes of the order.
By 1970, there were three Red Lobsters in operation, all in central Florida, and two more under construction. The three units, which despite their name specialized in the fried fish and hush puppies favored by southerners, averaged $800,000 each in annual sales, and earnings were solid, but the company lacked the cash to grow. For General Mills, a diversified food products giant, acquiring Red Lobster Inns of America made sense because General Mills' fish sales accounted for about $80 million of revenue, or one-ninth of its total sales. Darden was hired to oversee the chain and open a restaurant headquarters in Orlando. He later became a General Mills vice-president and senior consultant, retired in 1984, and died in 1994.
General Mills upgraded Red Lobster into a midpriced seafood dinner house that was a model of corporate efficiency. Lee, who rose to become president of Red Lobster in 1975, carried a slide rule with him everywhere in the early 1970s to calculate prices and portion weights, and to quantify whatever else could be quantified. He also carried a thermometer in order to assure that entrees had been cooked to the proper temperature before being served. In 1971 Red Lobster established an in-house department for purchasing seafood on a worldwide scale. The company also established, long before the rest of the industry, a computerized point-of-purchase system to track how much of any given item was selling where.

Rapid Growth in the 1970s

Red Lobster grew in each year of operation, and it grew rapidly. By the end of fiscal 1971 there were 24 restaurants with total sales of $9.1 million, and by the end of fiscal 1972 there were 47 with sales of $27.1 million. When Lee was named president of Red Lobster in 1975, there were 97 restaurants with 9,500 employees. In 1976 the General Mills subsidiary opened a microbiology laboratory in Orlando to ensure the quality of its products. Red Lobster ended that fiscal year with 174 units in 26 states and total sales of $174.1 million.
Because of higher costs, attributed in large part to increased fuel bills for truck transportation and fishing boats caused by the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, Red Lobster again felt the need to upgrade in the mid-1970s. It carpeted the floors, re-styled the interiors, and added a few fresh dishes to its predominantly frozen menu, and it sharply jacked up prices to pay for the improvements. The strategy worked. By the end of 1980 Red Lobster, with 260 units and almost $400 million in annual sales, had reached ninth place among fast-food companies and accounted for more than half of total sales by seafood fast-food companies. Although a sit-down chain, frequently with lounges, it was considered "fast food" by some analysts because most entree items were delivered frozen.
Alternatively, however, by 1982 Red Lobster was rated as the nation's largest "dinner-house" restaurant chain, this being the name for a restaurant offering table service and a full lunch and dinner menu. With an average annual return on invested assets of 22.3 percent before taxes, it was one of the most profitable chains in its field, and its growth had come entirely without franchising.

Wider Choices in the 1980s

Red Lobster provided General Mills with $75 million in operating earnings during fiscal 1982. By early 1983 there were 350 establishments in 36 states. The first of dozens of franchised Red Lobsters in Japan opened in Tokyo in 1982, and the first Canadian unit opened in 1983. Securities analysts attributed the chain's success, in large part, to Red Lobster's position as the only nationwide seafood dinner chain and its extraordinary quality-control measures. According to one of its executives, while seafood could be 16 days old and still legally sold as fresh, Red Lobster's seafood, although frozen, was "fresh frozen" at five regional warehouses, each with a quality-control laboratory.
During 1982, however, Red Lobster decided to pursue a new direction. The chain's research, according to Lee, indicated that its customers resented waiting in line yet did not like being hustled out, and wanted a more casual dining experience, with an atmosphere conducive to drinks, appetizers, and finger food to share instead of massive entrees. Accordingly, a prototype unit opened in Kissimmee, Florida, in 1984 was a grazer's delight, with a seafood bar serving up oysters, shrimp, clams, calamari, and other appetizers with drinks, and a glass-enclosed grill where fresh seafood was broiled over mesquite-wood flames. Red Lobster restaurants had deliberately been built without windows so that diners would not take up time seeking a table looking out, but the new unit had picturesque views. Waiters were instructed to relax instead of speeding diners through the dinner cycle.
In 1984, General Mills authorized a $104 million remodeling program for Red Lobster, the largest capital-spending item in the parent company's history. All 370 units were to be overhauled, with the menu 40 percent longer to include such items as seafood salads and pastas, and six or eight fresh fish entrees available, twice as many as in the past. Dinner prices were lowered to draw more customers, with the expectation that patrons would make up for the difference by increased spending on appetizers and alcoholic beverages.








Red Lobster continued to reinvent itself and reward its parent company in subsequent years, passing $1 billion in North American sales during 1988. By then it was General Mills' second largest revenue producer, trailing only the cereals division and accounting for about one-fifth of the parent company's business. A food industry analyst told the New York Times, "They have a concept that works extremely well, but they also constantly refresh their franchise. ... If Cajun food is hot, they'll put five Cajun entrees on the menu. Whatever's hot, they'll do it."
By this time Red Lobster was offering more than 100 seafood items every day. To supply its units it was buying about 58 million pounds of seafood every year, combing the world's oceans for the latest novelty. These included popcorn shrimp, caught off the shores of Brazil, slipper lobster from Thailand, and Pacific orange roughy, a whitefish from New Zealand to supplement North American standbys from Florida stone crab and Maine flounder to Alaska salmon. By 1995 Red Lobster was purchasing seafood from 44 countries.
The array of options allowed the chain to draw in new customers by featuring bargain specials. Close contact between the chain's buyers and thousands of entrepreneurial fishing operations, and delivery by overnight air express services, enabled much of the catch to reach units daily while still fresh. The price of Red Lobster dinner entrees ranged from about $7 to $19 in 1995. Lunch entrees ranged from about $4.30 to $7. Red Lobster also offered a lower-priced children's menu.
Questionnaires and focus groups also convinced Red Lobster of the importance of good service to securing follow-up trade. It held a four-day training course for servers before each restaurant opened and then required the staff to attend follow-up monthly classes. After 1986 waiters and waitresses were encouraged to display individuality in serving customers rather than relying on mechanical recitations of what the restaurant had to offer. The uniform of shirts and slacks was replaced by a maroon apron under which servers wore clothing of their own choice. They also were motivated by Red Lobster's reputation for good benefits, flexible hours, chances for advancement, and the hope of earning more than $100 in tips on good nights.

The Olive Garden: 1982-95

Fearing saturation in the seafood market, however, General Mills had decided years earlier to expand its restaurant group, which included York Steak House as well as Red Lobster. In 1982, following five years of painstaking research and about $28 million for development funds, the company opened the first Olive Garden restaurant in Orlando. By the end of 1985 there were eight such units, and by mid-1989 there were 145, making it General Mills' fastest-growing business and probably the fastest-growing major chain in the United States.
A 1991 Forbes article found the dinner portions, averaging only $10, enormous, but called the salad soggy with dressing, the chicken bland, and the fettucine alfredo like something out of a TV dinner. The public, however, flocked to these outlets. Average sales per Olive Garden were $2.8 million that year, compared with $3 million for Red Lobster, and both were high for the industry. The Olive Garden ended fiscal 1992 with $808 million in sales and 341 outlets. It reached the $1-billion-a-year sales mark in 1993. The menu, in 1995, included not only Italian specialties such as veal piccata, baked lasagna, and chicken marsala but a variety of veal, beef, and seafood dishes. Dinner entree prices ranged from about $7 to $14.25, and lunch entree prices ranged from about $4.25 to $8.75. A limited-menu Olive Garden Cafe concept in food court settings at regional shopping malls was being tested. There were seven such units in late 1995.

Ill-Fated China Coast: 1990-95

The success of The Olive Garden encouraged General Mills to expand its ethnic food format. After three years of development and test marketing the restaurant group launched China Coast in 1990 as the first national Chinese food chain. This eatery opened with an eight-page menu, in Newsweek's words, "about as long as the list of emperors in the Ming Dynasty." The interiors were festooned with bamboo, paper lanterns, and Chinese-character wall scrolls, and the servers wore Chinese-style jackets. Eventually the China Coast chain grew to 51, but it failed to thrive and was ordered closed in 1995. During fiscal 1995 China Coast's sales came to only $71 million, and Wall Street analysts estimated that it lost $20 million that year. Thirty China Coast restaurants were converted into Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens.

Forming Darden Restaurants in 1995

General Mills decided in 1995 to spin off its restaurant operations into a new company so that it could concentrate more on its consumer food products. Lee, the chairman and chief executive officer, named the new company Darden Restaurants in honor of his mentor and Red Lobster's founder. Stockholders received one share of Darden Restaurants common stock for each share of General Mills common stock they held. In their last fiscal year under General Mills' auspices, Darden Restaurants' constituent units had combined net income of $108.3 million.
Investors failed to rally around Darden Restaurants, whose stock ended its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange below the $12 to $13 a share expected by analysts. One securities analyst said that the restaurants had been accounting for only one-quarter of General Mills' operating profits while absorbing half of the company's capital spending for expansion and renovation. Nevertheless, its market capitalization of $1.8 billion made it second in size only to McDonald's among the nation's publicly traded restaurant companies.
Darden Restaurants indicated in early 1996 that the China Coast experience would not keep it from trying other ethnic formats. In March of that year it began test marketing Bahama Breeze Caribbean Grille, with a menu drawn from Spanish, French, African, Dutch, Indian, and American influences. Entrees, priced between $5 and $15, were to include Bahamian conch chowder, slow-roasted ribs, Caribbean paella, jerk chicken, and rum-glazed yellowtail dolphin, washed down with Caribbean-island beer and other drinks. Lee predicted that, whether Bahama Breeze went into operation or not, Darden Restaurants would add at least two chains to its repertoire by 1998.
Darden Restaurants executives expressed confidence that they were on the right track toward long-term robust growth. Casual dining, according to the company, was the fastest-growing segment of the full-service restaurant market, with sales increasing at more than twice the overall market's rate since 1988 and representing, in 1995, 32 percent of full-service restaurant sales, or $29 billion. The trend toward casual dining, it argued, was reflected in the less formal dress code in the workplace and would continue in years to come. Moreover, the company noted that 40- to 60-year-olds were the most frequent visitors to casual dining restaurants, and that the population aged 45 and older was expected to grow by 40 million through 2010.
At the end of fiscal 1995, Darden Restaurants was operating 1,250 restaurants in every state except Alaska. A total of 73 were in Canada. Red Lobster restaurants were being remodeled, with weathered wood accented by nautical artifacts for a wharfside effect, to be completed by the end of fiscal 1997.

The Late 1990s and Beyond

Despite the company's positive outlook for the future, Darden Restaurants began to experience financial setbacks in 1997 due to market saturation. As such, the company was forced to shutdown some of its poor performing restaurants. Lee commented on the restructuring in a 1997 Nation's Restaurant News article claiming, "There are some situations where we oversaturated and there were some areas where the market changed." The article also stated, "Lee described the closings and write-offs as a strategic move to increase positive cash flow." By the end of the fiscal 1997, 48 restaurants were closed--including 26 outlets in Canada--and the firm posted a $91 million loss as a result of the restructuring charges.
Determined to get Darden Restaurants back on track, management focused on reviving the Red Lobster and Olive Garden chains and also eyeballed its Bahama Breeze concept to bolster sales. After its lackluster performance in 1997, the company rebounded and secured profits of $102 million in 1998. The following year, the company established the Culinary Institute of Tuscany in Italy. The facility was created to train Olive Garden chefs in an authentic Italian environment. New Red Lobster restaurants were opened with open floor plans and larger bar areas. Olive Garden restaurants also received a new look and were designed to resemble a Tuscan farmhouse. Darden Restaurants also began testing a new restaurant concept entitled Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar and opened its first unit in Orlando in late 1999. The restaurant could seat 300 and had a U-shaped bar in the center. Decorated similar to a mountain lodge, the outlet catered to sports fans with 40 televisions throughout the restaurant and monitors at each table.
Having successfully overcome the sluggish sales of 1996 and 1997, Darden began to actively pursue new store openings. By the end of 1999, there were 669 Red Lobster restaurants, 464 Olive Garden outlets, six Bahama Breeze units, and one Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar, and additional store openings were slated for the upcoming year. Profits for 1999 reached $140.5 million on revenues of $3.46 billion.
Darden Restaurants entered the new millennium on solid financial ground. Sales increased 7 percent over the previous year while earnings climbed to $173.1 million. During the year, Red Lobster and Olive Garden achieved their tenth and 23rd consecutive quarter of sales increases, respectively. The company as a whole recorded its 14th consecutive quarter of earnings increases. The company posted its best financial year to date in fiscal 2001. During the year, sales reached $4 billion, while earnings increased to $197 million. The number of Bahama Breeze restaurants rose to 21, while nine Smokey Bones were in operation--national expansion for the sports concept was scheduled to begin in 2002. In addition to its financial gains, the company was named by Fortune magazine as one of the top 50 companies for minorities for the third year in a row.
Darden's strategy for 2000 and beyond included a constant reviving of the Red Lobster and Olive Garden chains, expansion of existing new concepts, and the acquisition and development of new concepts. According to Darden, casual dining sales were projected to increase between 6 to 8 percent over the next ten years. Although the American economy began faltering in 2000, the company claimed that historically, the casual dining industry had weathered past economic downturns quite well and that sales had grown during the 1990-91 recession. As such, Darden management remained confident that the company would experience success in the years to come.

Darden Restaurants: Corporate Rap Sheet



Darden Restaurants
by Philip Mattera
Darden dominates the full-service restaurant sector with more than 2,000 locations that serve more than 400 million meals per year. Its Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants can be found throughout the United States, though the company has announced plans to sell the latter chain. The company also operates smaller chains such as LongHorn Steakhouse and Capital Grille. Outside the U.S., Darden's presence has been limited to a few dozen company-owned locations in Canada and similar numbers of franchise outlets in Asia and the Middle East. It is also beginning to expand into various parts of Latin America.
Darden, which has some 195,000 hourly employees, has been embroiled in numerous controversies over its labor practices and is a leading foe of workplace reforms such as paid sick days.
In October 2013 hedge fund Barington Capital Group launched an effort to force the company to split in two. Two months later, facing poor financial results, Darden gave in to the pressure and announced that it would spin off or sell its Red Lobster chain while also halting expansion of the Olive Garden chain and refraining from new acquisitions. Barington and another hedge fund, Starboard Value, are pressing for more aggressive restructuring. Darden, nonetheless, announced plans in May 2014 to sell only Red Lobster. More changes are expected in the wake of a successful October 2014 move by Starboard to  replace Darden's entire board of directors. 
The Green Frog
The company traces its roots back to 1938, when William Darden opened a lunch counter in Waycross, Georgia called The Green Frog. Bill Darden went on to open other eateries, but it was not until the late 1960s, when he started to build a string of moderately priced seafood restaurants in Florida, that those efforts began to have a significant impact. His Red Lobster chain was a roaring success and attracted the attention of food giant General Mills, which bought the company in 1970.
Bill Darden remained in charge after the acquisition, but it was his successor Joe Lee who spearheaded the growth of the chain using assembly-line methods like those employed at the company's fast food counterpart, McDonald's. Looking to expand its restaurant segment, General Mills launched an Italian-style chain called Olive Garden in 1982. Despite negative reviews of its menu, Olive Garden was a hit. Within a decade it had some 340 outlets and more than $800 million in annual revenues.
In 1995 General Mills decided to spin off its restaurant operations so it could focus on consumer food products. Joe Lee named the new company Darden Restaurants in honor of the Red Lobster founder. Darden subsequently introduced new chains such as Bahama Breeze Caribbean Grille, and in 2007 it acquired RARE Hospitality Inc., operator of the LongHorn Steakhouse chain and the upscale Capital Grilles.
Darden brags that in the 1930s its founder took the bold step of welcoming diners of any race in his restaurants, located in the South, but the company has adopted somewhat less enlightened practices in more recent years, especially with regard to its employees. These practices have prompted protests at the company’s annual meetings in recent years.
 Wage and Hour Disputes
For more than a decade, Darden has been accused of using various means to shortchange its workers on their paychecks, a practice known as wage theft. In 2005 the company agreed to pay $9.5 million to more than 20,000 current and former servers at Red Lobster and Olive Garden outlets in California to settle a lawsuit claiming that the restaurants violated state labor regulations by preventing workers from taking required breaks and by requiring them to purchase and maintain their uniforms.
Three years later, Darden disclosed that it had paid $4 million to settle two class-action lawsuits alleging that it had violated California law in requiring servers and bartenders to make up for cash shortages at the end of their shifts. Also in 2008, Darden reported that it had paid $700,000 to settle another California suit claiming several types of wage and hour violations, including a failure to provide itemized wage statements and timely pay when an employee was terminated.
In 2011, following a U.S. Labor Department investigation that found workers were not being paid for all their hours, Darden agreed to pay $25,000 in back wages to 140 current and former servers at an Olive Garden in Mesquite, Texas.  The company was also fined $30,800. That same year, the company consented to pay $27,000 in back pay and was fined $23,980 in connection with a similar federal investigation at a Red Lobster in Lubbock, Texas.
In the wake of the two Texas cases, suits were brought against Darden in several other states. For example, in early 2012 Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC United) filed a class action case on behalf of Darden workers at the company's Capital Grille restaurants. For technical reasons, the action was later divided into separate actions in five jurisdictions (all are still pending).
An even larger legal challenge to the company came in September 2012, when a class action suit was filed in federal court in Miami on behalf of all current and former employees (back to 2009) at five of Darden's chains. The 54 named plaintiffs in the case stated that the company did not pay them for the period between the beginning of their shifts and the time customers began to arrive, thereby forcing them to do prep work off the clock. Darden was also accused of failing to pay time-and-a-half for those working more than 40 hours per week and for improperly applying the lower subminimum wage for tipped workers when they were engaged in non-serving tasks.
The complaint in the case -- which described the company as having "a steadfast, single minded focus on minimizing its labor costs" by arranging to have "as many tasks as possible performed by as few employees as possible" -- also alleged that two of the named plaintiffs had suffered retaliation from management because of their participation in the case. As of October 8, 2013, approximately 13,000 current and former Darden servers had joined the suit, which is pending.
Darden is one of the large companies that pay workers with debit cards, a practice that has generated controversy because of the onerous fees often imposed by the card issuers. Darden is among the employers that have been contacted by the New York State Attorney General's office, which is conducting an investigation of the practice. 
 
Employee Benefits
In anticipation of the Affordable Care Act's penalties on large employers that do not provide health coverage for full-time workers, Darden switched more of its workers to part-time status in 2012, but it later abandoned that plan in the face of criticism.
 
Discriminatory Practices and Racial and Sexual Harassment
The ROC United wage theft actions against Capital Grille also allege that the chain has engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination, including the denial of better-paid server and bartender jobs to non-white workers.
In 2009 the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced that Darden's Bahama Breeze chain would pay $1.26 million to settle allegations that managers at its restaurant in Beachwood, Ohio had subjected 37 black workers to repeated overt racial harassment. In addition to the monetary relief, the chain signed a three-year consent decree requiring it to improve its anti-discrimination practices throughout the country.
In September 2013 the EEOC filed suit against Red Lobster, alleging that female workers at its restaurant in Salisbury, Maryland have been subjected to "pervasive sexual harassment." According to the agency, the harassment was committed by a manager, whose superior was said to have failed to take prompt action on the matter despite complaints from at least one of the affected workers.
 
Tipping Issues
In February 2011 Darden announced that it would require servers to share their tips with bartenders and busboys. The move was seen as a way for the company to reduce its labor costs by subjecting more workers to the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers.
In the wake of an Internal Revenue Service ruling that automatic tips such as those that some of Darden's restaurants apply to larger groups would be treated as wages and thus subject to payroll taxes, the company is reportedly considering ending the practice.
In December 2013 Darden announced that it would do away with the 18-percent automatic gratuities it was adding to parties of eight or more.  
 
Lobbying Activities
Darden has also sought to lower its labor costs by becoming more active in the public policy arena. Until 2007 Darden spent less than $250,000 a year on federal lobbying. Beginning in 2008 that amount jumped to well over $1 million annually.
In 2006 the company hired veteran corporate operative Robert McAdam to be its Senior Vice President of Government and Community Affairs. He previously worked for Wal-Mart and the Tobacco Institute. McAdam joined the board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the organization that writes corporate-friendly legislation frequently adopted by conservative state legislators. (Darden was later one of dozens of companies to leave the group.)  The company remains a prominent participant in the National Restaurant Association (NRA), where McAdam is a member of the board of directors.
The NRA has promoted policies that enhance Darden's bottom line. It has opposed living wage initiatives, worked to keep the minimum wage for tipped workers at $2.13 an hour (where it has remained since 1991) and resisted efforts by labor groups to enact mandatory paid sick days, often by promoting state laws that pre-empt local ordinances on the issue. Darden is reported to have helped write the pre-emption bill in Florida.
Darden CEO Clarence Otis personally lobbied against a California bill designed to penalize large companies whose workers have to depend on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage.
The company, nonetheless, highlights the fact that it has been included in Fortune's list of the Best Companies to Work For. The legitimacy of that list--which is produced by an organization, the Great Place to Work Institute, which sells consulting services to the companies it ranks--has come under question.
Hygiene Issues
Although Darden emphasizes its commitment to food safety, the company has faced a series of incidents involving food poisoning . For example, in 2002 an outbreak of salmonella that affected about 180 persons (including one who died) was tied to a Red Lobster in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
In 2006 more than 300 people who had eaten at an Olive Garden an Indianapolis suburb were reported to have experienced gastrointestinal illness. Several employees tested positive for norovirus. The company later settled a class action lawsuit linked to the incident for $387,000.
In 2011 officials in Cumberland County, North Carolina advised persons who had eaten at an Olive Garden in Fayetteville during an eight-day period to get a Hepatitis A shot because a worker at the restaurant had tested positive for the disease. Darden settled a lawsuit linked to the incident by establishing a $375,000 fund out of which those who had been immunized would each receive $250.
In the summer of 2013 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration linked prepackaged salads from Mexico served at Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants in Iowa and Nebraska to an outbreak of the stomach virus cyclospora that affected several hundred people.
 Consumer Protection
In 2007 Darden settled Federal Trade Commission allegations that it deceived consumers in the sale of gift cards by failing to disclose adequately the "dormancy fees" that would be subtracted from the value of the cards after a period of non-use. In addition to improving its disclosure practices, Darden agreed to refund fees that had been charged. The FTC did not announce the total cost of the refunds, but Darden had reported that the agency was proposing a figure of $31 million.
In 2009, Darden's Olive Garden chain settled a class action alleging that it had violated federal law by printing the last six digits of customer credit card numbers on receipts (rather than the legal limit of five digits). The settlement consisted of $9 appetizer vouchers sent to about 12,000 affected customers.
 
Tax Avoidance and Subsidies
In 2006, following what it claimed was a nationwide search for a new headquarters location, Darden decided to stay in Orange County, Florida after negotiating at least $12.3 million in state and local economic development subsidies for new offices. The total included a $2.5 million Qualified Target Industry Tax Refund and a $2 million Economic Development Transportation fund award.
Because Darden’s corporate income tax liability was not large enough to take full advantage of the state credits it had been offered, in 2011 the company began lobbying the Florida legislature for the right to apply the credit to its sales tax liabilities instead. The change was said to be worth about $5 million a year. The legislature adopted the change but specified that it would begin only after 20 years.
Darden has sought to further reduce its property tax payments by challenging the appraised value of the furniture and equipment in its headquarters. Its appeals were rejected in 2011 and 2012.

History[edit]




The company's former logo, used until 2009.


What would come to be known as Darden Restaurants, began when William (Bill) Darden, age 19 opened his first restaurant, The Green Frog, in Waycross, Georgia, in 1938. He later founded the Red Lobster Inns of America and opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968.[6] Darden chose Lakeland because he wished to see how a seafood restaurant would fare in a non-coastal region, and Lakeland was the innermost city in Florida. The initial Red Lobster franchise was applauded by diners and critics alike. The store became successful and by 1970 had expanded to three locations in the state with two more under construction. While the locations were profitable, the company lacked the resources to expand further, so Darden sold the company to food giant General Mills that year.[7]
General Mills ownership[edit]
General Mills upgraded the chain to a more casual dining/family fare oriented format, opened a new company headquarters in Orlando and retained Darden as company manager. In 1975, when Darden was promoted to Vice President of General Mills, Joseph (Joe) R. Lee, the company's first restaurant manager, was promoted as President of Red Lobster. Under General Mills ownership, Red Lobster expanded into a chain of almost 400 locations by 1985. The company underwent several restructurings and transformed itself from an inexpensive fast-food seller into a chain of casual dining seafood restaurants by 1988.[7]
One of the company's first ventures into the diversification of its portfolio was the York Steak House chain of English-themed steak and chop restaurants in the 1970s. The franchised steak and potatoes restaurant was a cafeteria-style restaurant with salad bar and hot station. By the end of the 1980s, the chain had been mostly closed down, though some independent locations still exist. These places were very similar to a Ruby Tuesdays® now.[8][9]
In 1982, Darden opened the first Olive Garden concept store in Orlando. The chain took off, and by 1989 General Mills had opened over 145 stores, making the chain the fastest-growing unit in the company's restaurant holdings. While Olive Garden did not meet critical success, it was popular, and its per-store sales soon grew to match those of Red Lobster. The company eventually became the largest chain of Italian-themed full-service restaurants in the United States.[7]
In 1990, China Coast was launched as an attempt to create a (U.S.) national casual dining restaurant that featured American Chinese cuisine. While the chain eventually expanded to some 50 restaurants, its sales were lackluster and lost an estimated $20 million USD. By the end of 1995, the company was shuttered, and the remaining locations were either converted to Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens or closed altogether.[7][10]
Darden[edit]
In 1995, General Mills decided to spin off its restaurant chains to focus on consumer food products. The new company was named Darden Restaurants, after Red Lobster's founder. General Mills stockholders received one share of Darden for every common share of General Mills held. General Mills restaurants had $108 million net income in that year. At the end of 1995, Darden operated 1,250 restaurants in 49 states with 73 locations in Canada.[7]
Darden Restaurants was spun off from General Mills beginning on May 9, 1995, when it began trading on when-issue basis at $9.75 a share.[11] The company became a fully separate entity on May 31, 1995, when its shares went on sale on the NYSE. The shares opened at $10.75, 17% below expectations, but climbed to $11.125 by the close of trading.[12]
Darden executives planned to have two additional chains in place by 1998. In March 1996, Darden launched a test of Bahama Breeze Caribbean Grille concept featuring food and drinks found in the islands of the Caribbean Sea and a Caribbean theme, was created in 1996.[7]
Markets were over saturated with restaurants in 1997 forcing Darden to close 48 poor performing locations and lose $91 million due to the restructuring. Red Lobster and Olive Garden were given make overs in 1998. Darden also made a profit of $102 million that year.[7]
1999 saw Darden opening additional location after recovering from the 1996-1997 losses. The company then began testing a new concept entitled Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar that opened in late 1999 in Orlando. The restaurant is a sports bar concept featuring barbecue and related foodstuffs in an Appalachian mountain-lodge setting.[7]
In 2003, Seasons 52 was under development with the idea of "provide guests the opportunity to indulge while still eating well." Season 52 were only being opened in the Florida or Atlanta markets during its initial phase.[13]
Darden announced in January 2007 that the company was willing to expand by purchasing an existing 100 location chains even considering franchisors.[14] By May, Darden indicated that its Smokey Bones division would be sold and or shut down including the two Rocky River Grillhouse, the proposed replacement concept for Smokey Bones.[15] In August, Darden acquired rival Atlanta-based restaurant holder Rare Hospitality for $1.4 billion USD, gaining Rare's two chains, The Capital Grille and LongHorn Steakhouse. As part of the Rare acquisition, Darden set up its Specialty Restaurant Group to include Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52.[16] In December, Darden announced that it would sell its Smokey Bones chain to Barbeque Integrated, Inc., an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for approximately $80 million. The sale was completed in January, 2008.[6][17]
Expansion and ownership changes[edit]
In 2010, Seasons 52 started a new expansion phase opening up in 11 more states over the next three years.[13]
In January 2011, Darden announced co-locating their Olive Garden and Red Lobster brands in smaller markets to share kitchen but continue separate menus and eating areas.[18] As part of the February Darden analyst conference, an analyst indicated that the corporation may be targeting another restaurant chain for acquisition possibly one of BJ's, California Pizza Kitchen or Yard House.[19] In October 2011, Darden acquired 2 chains, Eddie V’s Prime Seafood and Wildfish Seafood Grille, for $59 million cash transaction and were placed within its Specialty Restaurant Group,[20] Also In October, Darden signed an area-development agreement with Americana Group of Kuwait to develop and operate at least 60 locations using the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse concepts.[21]
In July 2012, Darden acquired the Yard House 39 location beer-centric chain for $585 million from TSG Consumer Partners. Yard House will be alongside the other upscale restaurants in Darden's Specialty Restaurant Group.[22] On December 23, 2013, Darden's stock rose 3 percent after activist investor Starboard Value, a hedge fund, took a stake in the company.[23]
Red Lobster sale[edit]
On December 19, 2013, Darden announced plans to sell or spin-off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors.[24] This was in direct response to the company spending US$100 million on a new digital platform. At the time, the project was already at least one year behind schedule and above budget. A large number of layoffs occurred in its marketing department, and the company's second in command also left.[25]
On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of the spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations.[26] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion.[27] Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Differences between Starboard and Darden management soon emerged over the hedge fund's proposal to split the company in two and spin off a third to handle their real estate portfolio, a move Starboard said would greatly boost shareholder value. Matters came to head when management announced a plan to spin off the underperforming Red Lobster early in 2014. Starboard led a large group of investors in asking management to delay the move and see if better options, such as its plans to revitalize the chain, were available.[29] When management instead decided to sell the chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital in May, Starboard and other investors sharply criticized the $2.1 billion "fire sale" price as a serious undervaluing of Red Lobster and its assets such as the underlying real estate. It also claimed management had refused shareholders' requests for a special meeting to discuss the deal.[30]
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis, Jr. announced he would be resigning at the end of the year, the same day the Red Lobster sale was complete.[31] Management said afterwards that it would work on a needed turnaround plan for Olive Garden, also struggling. However, after CNBC reported on a leaked document, supposedly offered to potential lenders and buyers earlier in the year, that described Red Lobster's financial position far more optimistically than management had in its contemporary public statements,[32] one of the investors, a union pension fund, filed suit alleging material misrepresentation.[33] Management claimed the document had been prepared by Golden Gate in consultation with Red Lobster's executives, who could have been expected to have that view of the chain's future.[32] Eugene Lee was named permanent CEO on February 23, 2015, after serving as interim CEO in October 2014.[34]
Starboard assembled its own slate of directors to challenge all the sitting board members in the company's upcoming shareholder elections. In support of their candidacy it released a 294-slide presentation in early September about how the company had gone wrong and how its directors would restore it to health. While it received considerable media attention for its detailed focus on Olive Garden, in particular the chain's "wasteful" practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once (to prevent food waste due to staleness: instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table; additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand) and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots, it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chain's corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did.[35][36] Management responded two days later that it was already implementing many of the suggested changes, and said the free breadsticks merely represented "Italian generosity."[37] Nevertheless, in October, shareholders replaced the entire board with Starboard's slate, in what an observer called an "epic fail" for management, since that rarely happens.[38]
On March 27, 2017, Darden announced its intent to acquire Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million[39] from shareholders such as L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. On March 28, 2017, when Darden announced it that had acquired Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen and "lifted its full-year earnings outlook," the company became the biggest gainer that day on the S&P 500, with shares growing nearly 9 percent.[40] The acquisition was completed on April 24, 2017.[41]

History[edit]




The company's former logo, used until 2009.


What would come to be known as Darden Restaurants, began when William (Bill) Darden, age 19 opened his first restaurant, The Green Frog, in Waycross, Georgia, in 1938. He later founded the Red Lobster Inns of America and opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968.[6] Darden chose Lakeland because he wished to see how a seafood restaurant would fare in a non-coastal region, and Lakeland was the innermost city in Florida. The initial Red Lobster franchise was applauded by diners and critics alike. The store became successful and by 1970 had expanded to three locations in the state with two more under construction. While the locations were profitable, the company lacked the resources to expand further, so Darden sold the company to food giant General Mills that year.[7]
General Mills ownership[edit]
General Mills upgraded the chain to a more casual dining/family fare oriented format, opened a new company headquarters in Orlando and retained Darden as company manager. In 1975, when Darden was promoted to Vice President of General Mills, Joseph (Joe) R. Lee, the company's first restaurant manager, was promoted as President of Red Lobster. Under General Mills ownership, Red Lobster expanded into a chain of almost 400 locations by 1985. The company underwent several restructurings and transformed itself from an inexpensive fast-food seller into a chain of casual dining seafood restaurants by 1988.[7]
One of the company's first ventures into the diversification of its portfolio was the York Steak House chain of English-themed steak and chop restaurants in the 1970s. The franchised steak and potatoes restaurant was a cafeteria-style restaurant with salad bar and hot station. By the end of the 1980s, the chain had been mostly closed down, though some independent locations still exist. These places were very similar to a Ruby Tuesdays® now.[8][9]
In 1982, Darden opened the first Olive Garden concept store in Orlando. The chain took off, and by 1989 General Mills had opened over 145 stores, making the chain the fastest-growing unit in the company's restaurant holdings. While Olive Garden did not meet critical success, it was popular, and its per-store sales soon grew to match those of Red Lobster. The company eventually became the largest chain of Italian-themed full-service restaurants in the United States.[7]
In 1990, China Coast was launched as an attempt to create a (U.S.) national casual dining restaurant that featured American Chinese cuisine. While the chain eventually expanded to some 50 restaurants, its sales were lackluster and lost an estimated $20 million USD. By the end of 1995, the company was shuttered, and the remaining locations were either converted to Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens or closed altogether.[7][10]
Darden[edit]
In 1995, General Mills decided to spin off its restaurant chains to focus on consumer food products. The new company was named Darden Restaurants, after Red Lobster's founder. General Mills stockholders received one share of Darden for every common share of General Mills held. General Mills restaurants had $108 million net income in that year. At the end of 1995, Darden operated 1,250 restaurants in 49 states with 73 locations in Canada.[7]
Darden Restaurants was spun off from General Mills beginning on May 9, 1995, when it began trading on when-issue basis at $9.75 a share.[11] The company became a fully separate entity on May 31, 1995, when its shares went on sale on the NYSE. The shares opened at $10.75, 17% below expectations, but climbed to $11.125 by the close of trading.[12]
Darden executives planned to have two additional chains in place by 1998. In March 1996, Darden launched a test of Bahama Breeze Caribbean Grille concept featuring food and drinks found in the islands of the Caribbean Sea and a Caribbean theme, was created in 1996.[7]
Markets were over saturated with restaurants in 1997 forcing Darden to close 48 poor performing locations and lose $91 million due to the restructuring. Red Lobster and Olive Garden were given make overs in 1998. Darden also made a profit of $102 million that year.[7]
1999 saw Darden opening additional location after recovering from the 1996-1997 losses. The company then began testing a new concept entitled Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar that opened in late 1999 in Orlando. The restaurant is a sports bar concept featuring barbecue and related foodstuffs in an Appalachian mountain-lodge setting.[7]
In 2003, Seasons 52 was under development with the idea of "provide guests the opportunity to indulge while still eating well." Season 52 were only being opened in the Florida or Atlanta markets during its initial phase.[13]
Darden announced in January 2007 that the company was willing to expand by purchasing an existing 100 location chains even considering franchisors.[14] By May, Darden indicated that its Smokey Bones division would be sold and or shut down including the two Rocky River Grillhouse, the proposed replacement concept for Smokey Bones.[15] In August, Darden acquired rival Atlanta-based restaurant holder Rare Hospitality for $1.4 billion USD, gaining Rare's two chains, The Capital Grille and LongHorn Steakhouse. As part of the Rare acquisition, Darden set up its Specialty Restaurant Group to include Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52.[16] In December, Darden announced that it would sell its Smokey Bones chain to Barbeque Integrated, Inc., an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for approximately $80 million. The sale was completed in January, 2008.[6][17]
Expansion and ownership changes[edit]
In 2010, Seasons 52 started a new expansion phase opening up in 11 more states over the next three years.[13]
In January 2011, Darden announced co-locating their Olive Garden and Red Lobster brands in smaller markets to share kitchen but continue separate menus and eating areas.[18] As part of the February Darden analyst conference, an analyst indicated that the corporation may be targeting another restaurant chain for acquisition possibly one of BJ's, California Pizza Kitchen or Yard House.[19] In October 2011, Darden acquired 2 chains, Eddie V’s Prime Seafood and Wildfish Seafood Grille, for $59 million cash transaction and were placed within its Specialty Restaurant Group,[20] Also In October, Darden signed an area-development agreement with Americana Group of Kuwait to develop and operate at least 60 locations using the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse concepts.[21]
In July 2012, Darden acquired the Yard House 39 location beer-centric chain for $585 million from TSG Consumer Partners. Yard House will be alongside the other upscale restaurants in Darden's Specialty Restaurant Group.[22] On December 23, 2013, Darden's stock rose 3 percent after activist investor Starboard Value, a hedge fund, took a stake in the company.[23]
Red Lobster sale[edit]
On December 19, 2013, Darden announced plans to sell or spin-off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors.[24] This was in direct response to the company spending US$100 million on a new digital platform. At the time, the project was already at least one year behind schedule and above budget. A large number of layoffs occurred in its marketing department, and the company's second in command also left.[25]
On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of the spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations.[26] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion.[27] Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Differences between Starboard and Darden management soon emerged over the hedge fund's proposal to split the company in two and spin off a third to handle their real estate portfolio, a move Starboard said would greatly boost shareholder value. Matters came to head when management announced a plan to spin off the underperforming Red Lobster early in 2014.

It also claimed management had refused shareholders' requests for a special meeting to discuss the deal.[30]
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis, Jr. announced he would be resigning at the end of the year, the same day the Red Lobster sale was complete.[31] Management said afterwards that it would work on a needed turnaround plan for Olive Garden, also struggling. However, after CNBC reported on a leaked document, supposedly offered to potential lenders and buyers earlier in the year, that described Red Lobster's financial position far more optimistically than management had in its contemporary public statements,[32] one of the investors, a union pension fund, filed suit alleging material misrepresentation.[33] Management claimed the document had been prepared by Golden Gate in consultation with Red Lobster's executives, who could have been expected to have that view of the chain's future.[32] Eugene Lee was named permanent CEO on February 23, 2015, after serving as interim CEO in October 2014.[34]
Starboard assembled its own slate of directors to challenge all the sitting board members in the company's upcoming shareholder elections. In support of their candidacy it released a 294-slide presentation in early September about how the company had gone wrong and how its directors would restore it to health. While it received considerable media attention for its detailed focus on Olive Garden, in particular the chain's "wasteful" practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once (to prevent food waste due to staleness: instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table; additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand) and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots, it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chain's corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did.[35][36] Management responded two days later that it was already implementing many of the suggested changes, and said the free breadsticks merely represented "Italian generosity."[37] Nevertheless, in October, shareholders replaced the entire board with Starboard's slate, in what an observer called an "epic fail" for management, since that rarely happens.[38]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]




The company's former logo, used until 2009.


What would come to be known as Darden Restaurants, began when William (Bill) Darden, age 19 opened his first restaurant, The Green Frog, in Waycross, Georgia, in 1938. He later founded the Red Lobster Inns of America and opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968.[6] Darden chose Lakeland because he wished to see how a seafood restaurant would fare in a non-coastal region, and Lakeland was the innermost city in Florida. The initial Red Lobster franchise was applauded by diners and critics alike. The store became successful and by 1970 had expanded to three locations in the state with two more under construction. While the locations were profitable, the company lacked the resources to expand further, so Darden sold the company to food giant General Mills that year.[7]
General Mills ownership[edit]
General Mills upgraded the chain to a more casual dining/family fare oriented format, opened a new company headquarters in Orlando and retained Darden as company manager. In 1975, when Darden was promoted to Vice President of General Mills, Joseph (Joe) R. Lee, the company's first restaurant manager, was promoted as President of Red Lobster. Under General Mills ownership, Red Lobster expanded into a chain of almost 400 locations by 1985. The company underwent several restructurings and transformed itself from an inexpensive fast-food seller into a chain of casual dining seafood restaurants by 1988.[7]
One of the company's first ventures into the diversification of its portfolio was the York Steak House chain of English-themed steak and chop restaurants in the 1970s. The franchised steak and potatoes restaurant was a cafeteria-style restaurant with salad bar and hot station. By the end of the 1980s, the chain had been mostly closed down, though some independent locations still exist. These places were very similar to a Ruby Tuesdays® now.[8][9]
In 1982, Darden opened the first Olive Garden concept store in Orlando. The chain took off, and by 1989 General Mills had opened over 145 stores, making the chain the fastest-growing unit in the company's restaurant holdings. While Olive Garden did not meet critical success, it was popular, and its per-store sales soon grew to match those of Red Lobster. The company eventually became the largest chain of Italian-themed full-service restaurants in the United States.[7]
In 1990, China Coast was launched as an attempt to create a (U.S.) national casual dining restaurant that featured American Chinese cuisine. While the chain eventually expanded to some 50 restaurants, its sales were lackluster and lost an estimated $20 million USD. By the end of 1995, the company was shuttered, and the remaining locations were either converted to Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens or closed altogether.[7][10]
Darden[edit]
In 1995, General Mills decided to spin off its restaurant chains to focus on consumer food products. The new company was named Darden Restaurants, after Red Lobster's founder. General Mills stockholders received one share of Darden for every common share of General Mills held. General Mills restaurants had $108 million net income in that year. At the end of 1995, Darden operated 1,250 restaurants in 49 states with 73 locations in Canada.[7]
Darden Restaurants was spun off from General Mills beginning on May 9, 1995, when it began trading on when-issue basis at $9.75 a share.[11] The company became a fully separate entity on May 31, 1995, when its shares went on sale on the NYSE. The shares opened at $10.75, 17% below expectations, but climbed to $11.125 by the close of trading.[12]
Darden executives planned to have two additional chains in place by 1998. In March 1996, Darden launched a test of Bahama Breeze Caribbean Grille concept featuring food and drinks found in the islands of the Caribbean Sea and a Caribbean theme, was created in 1996.[7]
Markets were over saturated with restaurants in 1997 forcing Darden to close 48 poor performing locations and lose $91 million due to the restructuring. Red Lobster and Olive Garden were given make overs in 1998. Darden also made a profit of $102 million that year.[7]
1999 saw Darden opening additional location after recovering from the 1996-1997 losses. The company then began testing a new concept entitled Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar that opened in late 1999 in Orlando. The restaurant is a sports bar concept featuring barbecue and related foodstuffs in an Appalachian mountain-lodge setting.[7]
In 2003, Seasons 52 was under development with the idea of "provide guests the opportunity to indulge while still eating well." Season 52 were only being opened in the Florida or Atlanta markets during its initial phase.[13]
Darden announced in January 2007 that the company was willing to expand by purchasing an existing 100 location chains even considering franchisors.[14] By May, Darden indicated that its Smokey Bones division would be sold and or shut down including the two Rocky River Grillhouse, the proposed replacement concept for Smokey Bones.[15] In August, Darden acquired rival Atlanta-based restaurant holder Rare Hospitality for $1.4 billion USD, gaining Rare's two chains, The Capital Grille and LongHorn Steakhouse. As part of the Rare acquisition, Darden set up its Specialty Restaurant Group to include Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52.[16] In December, Darden announced that it would sell its Smokey Bones chain to Barbeque Integrated, Inc., an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for approximately $80 million. The sale was completed in January, 2008.[6][17]
Expansion and ownership changes[edit]
In 2010, Seasons 52 started a new expansion phase opening up in 11 more states over the next three years.[13]
In January 2011, Darden announced co-locating their Olive Garden and Red Lobster brands in smaller markets to share kitchen but continue separate menus and eating areas.[18] As part of the February Darden analyst conference, an analyst indicated that the corporation may be targeting another restaurant chain for acquisition possibly one of BJ's, California Pizza Kitchen or Yard House.[19] In October 2011, Darden acquired 2 chains, Eddie V’s Prime Seafood and Wildfish Seafood Grille, for $59 million cash transaction and were placed within its Specialty Restaurant Group,[20] Also In October, Darden signed an area-development agreement with Americana Group of Kuwait to develop and operate at least 60 locations using the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse concepts.[21]
In July 2012, Darden acquired the Yard House 39 location beer-centric chain for $585 million from TSG Consumer Partners. Yard House will be alongside the other upscale restaurants in Darden's Specialty Restaurant Group.[22] On December 23, 2013, Darden's stock rose 3 percent after activist investor Starboard Value, a hedge fund, took a stake in the company.[23]
Red Lobster sale[edit]
On December 19, 2013, Darden announced plans to sell or spin-off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors.[24] This was in direct response to the company spending US$100 million on a new digital platform. At the time, the project was already at least one year behind schedule and above budget. A large number of layoffs occurred in its marketing department, and the company's second in command also left.[25]
On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of the spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations.[26] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion.[27] Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Differences between Starboard and Darden management soon emerged over the hedge fund's proposal to split the company in two and spin off a third to handle their real estate portfolio, a move Starboard said would greatly boost shareholder value. Matters came to head when management announced a plan to spin off the underperforming Red Lobster early in 2014. Starboard led a large group of investors in asking management to delay the move and see if better options, such as its plans to revitalize the chain, were available.[29] When management instead decided to sell the chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital in May, Starboard and other investors sharply criticized the $2.1 billion "fire sale" price as a serious undervaluing of Red Lobster and its assets such as the underlying real estate. It also claimed management had refused shareholders' requests for a special meeting to discuss the deal.[30]
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis, Jr. announced he would be resigning at the end of the year, the same day the Red Lobster sale was complete.[31] Management said afterwards that it would work on a needed turnaround plan for Olive Garden, also struggling. However, after CNBC reported on a leaked document, supposedly offered to potential lenders and buyers earlier in the year, that described Red Lobster's financial position far more optimistically than management had in its contemporary public statements,[32] one of the investors, a union pension fund, filed suit alleging material misrepresentation.[33] Management claimed the document had been prepared by Golden Gate in consultation with Red Lobster's executives, who could have been expected to have that view of the chain's future.[32] Eugene Lee was named permanent CEO on February 23, 2015, after serving as interim CEO in October 2014.[34]
Starboard assembled its own slate of directors to challenge all the sitting board members in the company's upcoming shareholder elections. In support of their candidacy it released a 294-slide presentation in early September about how the company had gone wrong and how its directors would restore it to health. While it received considerable media attention for its detailed focus on Olive Garden, in particular the chain's "wasteful" practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once (to prevent food waste due to staleness: instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table; additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand) and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots, it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chain's corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did.[35][36] Management responded two days later that it was already implementing many of the suggested changes, and said the free breadsticks merely represented "Italian generosity."[37] Nevertheless, in October, shareholders replaced the entire board with Starboard's slate, in what an observer called an "epic fail" for management, since that rarely happens.[38]
On March 27, 2017, Darden announced its intent to acquire Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million[39] from shareholders such as L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. On March 28, 2017, when Darden announced it that had acquired Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen and "lifted its full-year earnings outlook," the company became the biggest gainer that day on the S&P 500, with shares growing nearly 9 percent.[40] The acquisition was completed on April 24, 2017.[41]

History[edit]




The company's former logo, used until 2009.


What would come to be known as Darden Restaurants, began when William (Bill) Darden, age 19 opened his first restaurant, The Green Frog, in Waycross, Georgia, in 1938. He later founded the Red Lobster Inns of America and opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968.[6] Darden chose Lakeland because he wished to see how a seafood restaurant would fare in a non-coastal region, and Lakeland was the innermost city in Florida. The initial Red Lobster franchise was applauded by diners and critics alike. The store became successful and by 1970 had expanded to three locations in the state with two more under construction. While the locations were profitable, the company lacked the resources to expand further, so Darden sold the company to food giant General Mills that year.[7]
General Mills ownership[edit]
General Mills upgraded the chain to a more casual dining/family fare oriented format, opened a new company headquarters in Orlando and retained Darden as company manager. In 1975, when Darden was promoted to Vice President of General Mills, Joseph (Joe) R. Lee, the company's first restaurant manager, was promoted as President of Red Lobster. Under General Mills ownership, Red Lobster expanded into a chain of almost 400 locations by 1985. The company underwent several restructurings and transformed itself from an inexpensive fast-food seller into a chain of casual dining seafood restaurants by 1988.[7]
One of the company's first ventures into the diversification of its portfolio was the York Steak House chain of English-themed steak and chop restaurants in the 1970s. The franchised steak and potatoes restaurant was a cafeteria-style restaurant with salad bar and hot station. By the end of the 1980s, the chain had been mostly closed down, though some independent locations still exist. These places were very similar to a Ruby Tuesdays® now.[8][9]
In 1982, Darden opened the first Olive Garden concept store in Orlando. The chain took off, and by 1989 General Mills had opened over 145 stores, making the chain the fastest-growing unit in the company's restaurant holdings. While Olive Garden did not meet critical success, it was popular, and its per-store sales soon grew to match those of Red Lobster. The company eventually became the largest chain of Italian-themed full-service restaurants in the United States.[7]
In 1990, China Coast was launched as an attempt to create a (U.S.) national casual dining restaurant that featured American Chinese cuisine. While the chain eventually expanded to some 50 restaurants, its sales were lackluster and lost an estimated $20 million USD. By the end of 1995, the company was shuttered, and the remaining locations were either converted to Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens or closed altogether.[7][10]
Darden[edit]
In 1995, General Mills decided to spin off its restaurant chains to focus on consumer food products. The new company was named Darden Restaurants, after Red Lobster's founder. General Mills stockholders received one share of Darden for every common share of General Mills held. General Mills restaurants had $108 million net income in that year. At the end of 1995, Darden operated 1,250 restaurants in 49 states with 73 locations in Canada.[7]
Darden Restaurants was spun off from General Mills beginning on May 9, 1995, when it began trading on when-issue basis at $9.75 a share.[11] The company became a fully separate entity on May 31, 1995, when its shares went on sale on the NYSE. The shares opened at $10.75, 17% below expectations, but climbed to $11.125 by the close of trading.[12]
Darden executives planned to have two additional chains in place by 1998. In March 1996, Darden launched a test of Bahama Breeze Caribbean Grille concept featuring food and drinks found in the islands of the Caribbean Sea and a Caribbean theme, was created in 1996.[7]
Markets were over saturated with restaurants in 1997 forcing Darden to close 48 poor performing locations and lose $91 million due to the restructuring. Red Lobster and Olive Garden were given make overs in 1998. Darden also made a profit of $102 million that year.[7]
1999 saw Darden opening additional location after recovering from the 1996-1997 losses. The company then began testing a new concept entitled Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar that opened in late 1999 in Orlando. The restaurant is a sports bar concept featuring barbecue and related foodstuffs in an Appalachian mountain-lodge setting.[7]
In 2003, Seasons 52 was under development with the idea of "provide guests the opportunity to indulge while still eating well." Season 52 were only being opened in the Florida or Atlanta markets during its initial phase.[13]
Darden announced in January 2007 that the company was willing to expand by purchasing an existing 100 location chains even considering franchisors.[14] By May, Darden indicated that its Smokey Bones division would be sold and or shut down including the two Rocky River Grillhouse, the proposed replacement concept for Smokey Bones.[15] In August, Darden acquired rival Atlanta-based restaurant holder Rare Hospitality for $1.4 billion USD, gaining Rare's two chains, The Capital Grille and LongHorn Steakhouse. As part of the Rare acquisition, Darden set up its Specialty Restaurant Group to include Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52.[16] In December, Darden announced that it would sell its Smokey Bones chain to Barbeque Integrated, Inc., an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for approximately $80 million. The sale was completed in January, 2008.[6][17]
Expansion and ownership changes[edit]
In 2010, Seasons 52 started a new expansion phase opening up in 11 more states over the next three years.[13]
In January 2011, Darden announced co-locating their Olive Garden and Red Lobster brands in smaller markets to share kitchen but continue separate menus and eating areas.[18] As part of the February Darden analyst conference, an analyst indicated that the corporation may be targeting another restaurant chain for acquisition possibly one of BJ's, California Pizza Kitchen or Yard House.[19] In October 2011, Darden acquired 2 chains, Eddie V’s Prime Seafood and Wildfish Seafood Grille, for $59 million cash transaction and were placed within its Specialty Restaurant Group,[20] Also In October, Darden signed an area-development agreement with Americana Group of Kuwait to develop and operate at least 60 locations using the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse concepts.[21]
In July 2012, Darden acquired the Yard House 39 location beer-centric chain for $585 million from TSG Consumer Partners. Yard House will be alongside the other upscale restaurants in Darden's Specialty Restaurant Group.[22] On December 23, 2013, Darden's stock rose 3 percent after activist investor Starboard Value, a hedge fund, took a stake in the company.[23]
Red Lobster sale[edit]
On December 19, 2013, Darden announced plans to sell or spin-off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors.[24] This was in direct response to the company spending US$100 million on a new digital platform. At the time, the project was already at least one year behind schedule and above budget. A large number of layoffs occurred in its marketing department, and the company's second in command also left.[25]
On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of the spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations.[26] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion.[27] Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Differences between Starboard and Darden management soon emerged over the hedge fund's proposal to split the company in two and spin off a third to handle their real estate portfolio, a move Starboard said would greatly boost shareholder value. Matters came to head when management announced a plan to spin off the underperforming Red Lobster early in 2014. Starboard led a large group of investors in asking management to delay the move and see if better options, such as its plans to revitalize the chain, were available.[29] When management instead decided to sell the chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital in May, Starboard and other investors sharply criticized the $2.1 billion "fire sale" price as a serious undervaluing of Red Lobster and its assets such as the underlying real estate. It also claimed management had refused shareholders' requests for a special meeting to discuss the deal.[30]
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis, Jr. announced he would be resigning at the end of the year, the same day the Red Lobster sale was complete.[31] Management said afterwards that it would work on a needed turnaround plan for Olive Garden, also struggling. However, after CNBC reported on a leaked document, supposedly offered to potential lenders and buyers earlier in the year, that described Red Lobster's financial position far more optimistically than management had in its contemporary public statements,[32] one of the investors, a union pension fund, filed suit alleging material misrepresentation.[33] Management claimed the document had been prepared by Golden Gate in consultation with Red Lobster's executives, who could have been expected to have that view of the chain's future.[32] Eugene Lee was named permanent CEO on February 23, 2015, after serving as interim CEO in October 2014.[34]
Starboard assembled its own slate of directors to challenge all the sitting board members in the company's upcoming shareholder elections. In support of their candidacy it released a 294-slide presentation in early September about how the company had gone wrong and how its directors would restore it to health. While it received considerable media attention for its detailed focus on Olive Garden, in particular the chain's "wasteful" practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once (to prevent food waste due to staleness: instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table; additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand) and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots, it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chain's corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did.[35][36] Management responded two days later that it was already implementing many of the suggested changes, and said the free breadsticks merely represented "Italian generosity."[37] Nevertheless, in October, shareholders replaced the entire board with Starboard's slate, in what an observer called an "epic fail" for management, since that rarely happens.[38]
On March 27, 2017, Darden announced its intent to acquire Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million[39] from shareholders such as L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. On March 28, 2017, when Darden announced it that had acquired Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen and "lifted its full-year earnings outlook," the company became the biggest gainer that day on the S&P 500, with shares growing nearly 9 percent.[40] The acquisition was completed on April 24, 2017.[41]

		We know that life is better together and everyone is happiest when they’re with family, whether it’s immediate family, extended family, or a family of friends.  That’s why we treat everyone who walks through our doors like part of our family, sharing the food we love with the people we love, and spending the time we have, together.
      





















Where Great Food and Great Friends Come Together

			Since its founding in Orlando in 1982, Olive Garden has been dedicated to providing a warm and welcoming dining experience to everyone who walks in the door. These principles combined with its delicious food led to rapid expansion until it was the largest chain of Italian themed restaurants in the nation. 
          
Inspired by Italian generosity and food made with love, Olive Garden’s menu is always changing and expanding to ensure that there is always a new dish to try, a new flavor to discover. From exciting new specials and classic Italian favorites to a full menu of appetizers, desserts, wines, gluten-free and new lighter fare options, there’s something delicious for everyone at Olive Garden.

Olive Garden is Community

				Every day, in every Olive Garden location across the country, team members spend extra time to prepare, package, freeze and store unserved, surplus food for donation to local food banks, shelters and other charitable organizations.  Last year, those restaurants donated three million pounds of wholesome and ready-to-eat food.  Since 2003, Olive Garden has donated 33 million pounds of food to help those in need.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

News Release Details
Darden Restaurants Announces 2006 'Suppliers of the Year'


May 22, 2006

Download this Press Release (PDF 11 KB)

World's Largest Casual Dining Company Honors Its Best Suppliers With Top Award 
CHICAGO, May 22, 2006 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/ -- Whether it's blending traditional flavors together in a test kitchen to introduce a completely new one to America, hosting wine education classes for thousands of people or distributing products around the country, suppliers have a critical role in the success of a multi-unit restaurant company.  And some are the "cream of the crop." 
(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20050203/FLTH026LOGO ) 
Darden Restaurants, Inc., the world's largest casual dining restaurant company, today announced the 10 recipients of its prestigious William B. Darden Supplier Recognition Award.  The award is presented each year at the restaurant industry's premier trade show and is named for Darden Restaurants' founder, whose vision helped establish the casual dining industry nearly 40 years ago. 
Darden's 2006 "Suppliers of the Year" are The Bama Companies, Colavita USA, Golden-Tech International, King & Prince Seafood Corporation, Lotito Foods, Mullins Food Products, Palm Bay Imports, Inc., Shaw's Southern Belle, T. Marzetti Company and Maines Paper & Food Service. 
Darden, which owns and operates more than 1,400 Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, Smokey Bones Barbeque & Grill and Seasons 52 restaurants, presents the awards annually at the National Restaurant Association's Restaurant & Hotel/Motel Show to suppliers whose innovations significantly contributed to Darden's growth during the company's previous 12 months. 
"The 10 companies winning this year's 'Supplier of the Year' awards are trendsetters in our industry," said Clarence Otis, Darden Restaurants' chairman and chief executive officer.  "They go above and beyond the ordinary in providing us the products and services we need so we may provide the best dining experiences at a good value to our guests." 
Darden's culinary, purchasing, total quality and marketing teams selected the winners from the more than 2,000 suppliers Darden partnered with in fiscal 2006, which ends May 31, 2006.  Each winning supplier was chosen for exceeding expectations and demonstrating a distinguishing point of difference in the areas of quality, service, innovation and value. 
"Darden is proud to have such outstanding companies as our strategic partners," said Barry Moullet, senior vice president of supply chain and development.   "Suppliers who understand our business goals and bring us exciting products and ideas are integral to our company's continued success and growth." 
These organizations are the 2006 William B. Darden Supplier Recognition Award recipients: 
The Bama Companies. The Tulsa, Okla.-based company developed wheat dough for Seasons 52's popular flatbread appetizers. 
Colavita USA.  The Linden, N.J. provider of olive oil helped Olive Garden's culinary development, including participating in ideation tours in Italy, which is a key source of inspiration for Olive Garden's authentically Italian menu. 
Golden-Tech International. Based in Redmond, Wash., this company consistently helps Darden gain access to seafood providers in Asian markets and provides valuable information relating to new seafood resources. 
King & Prince Seafood Corporation. This Brunswick, Ga. seafood purveyor successfully completed a cost-saving freight program that enhanced the profitability of Red Lobster's menu promotions. 
Lotito Foods. This Edison, N.J.-based supplier of cheeses and gourmet products to all of Darden's restaurant companies supported their goal of freshening core menus and creating compelling food news with superior new products such as smoked mozzarella, asiago and provolone, while delivering exciting opportunities to share culinary expertise such as seminars presented by Italian culinary experts for Olive Garden. 
Mullins Food Products. Based in Broadview, Ill., Mullins enhanced Bahama Breeze's signature Jerk BBQ and Habanero wing sauces. 
Palm Bay Imports, Inc. This Syosset, N.Y. wine vendor helped Olive Garden enhance its wine offerings and contributed to the curriculum for its Culinary Institute of Tuscany. 
Shaw's Southern Belle. This Jacksonville, Fla.-based supplier of specialty seafood products provided support and innovation throughout the year, helping Red Lobster develop a new gourmet crab cake and successfully accommodating market change with a new lobster bisque. 
T. Marzetti Company. Based in Columbus, Ohio, this famous sauce and dressing company developed the signature berry vinaigrette for Smokey Bones' new grilled Oregon Pear and Spinach Salad.  The salad, featuring grilled pears, grapes, mandarin oranges, warm pecans, crumbled bleu cheese, red onions and tomatoes, debuted in December and has become one of the most popular salads on Smokey Bones' menu. 
Maines Paper & Food Service. This Hanover Park, Ill.-based company was named 2006 Distribution Center of the Year because Darden's restaurants gave it the highest satisfaction scores of all the company's distribution centers. 
Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE: DRI), based in Orlando, Fla., operates over 1,400 Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, Smokey Bones and Seasons 52 restaurants.  With annual sales of $5.3 billion, the company employs nearly 160,000 people who serve more than 300 million meals annually.  For more information, please visit http://www.darden.com .
