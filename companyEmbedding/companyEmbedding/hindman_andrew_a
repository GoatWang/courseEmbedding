It is my intention to create calm and peaceful paintings while at the same time creating paintings that feel alive and command attention.
With my brush I strive to make soft marks, and although they are delicate, they are also deliberate and courageous.

The owner/operator Andrew Hindman truly has an "artist's eye" for color, manipulating the image until it best represents the original. I am always impressed by his professional, quick turnaround, exquisite product, and fair pricing. All of my customers are amazed that the giclees are not, in fact, original oil paintings, they look that good!  I couldn't possibly recommend Andrew Hindman and Wholesale Giclee more." ~Brooke Walker-Knoblich.

Some of my framing customers have also discovered Andrew through my reference and many of the artists I frame for have been sent his way by me with only rave reviews. Like me, he believes in pleasing his customer first. You'll know after your first visit."  Tom Head, Abreu Gallery
