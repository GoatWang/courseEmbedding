LinkedIn



LinkedIn operates the world's largest professional network.  Started from a living room in 2002, the site officially launched on May 5, 2003.  After a month in business, it counted 4,500 members in the network. Today LinkedIn counts 300 million members in over 200 countries and territories around the globe.  BVP funded LinkedIn in 2006 and supported the company as it grew.  The company went public five years later in May 2011 (NYSE:LNKD).

Yelp



Yelp was founded in San Francisco in July 2004 to connect people to great local businesses. We became Yelp's first institutional investor in 2005. Shortly after our investment, Yelp's team of about a dozen people moved into a shuttered stereo store on San Francisco's Mission street. The location had an unexpected upside: Yelp board meetings took place in a padded room once used to demo loud set ups, which ensured that those confidential conversations would not be overheard. Today, that seems like ancient history. Yelp went public in 2012 (NYSE: YELP) and now has active communities in 32 countries around the world.  With more than 90 million rich, local reviews, Yelp is the leading local guide for real word-of-mouth on everything from boutiques and mechanics to restaurants and dentists.

Pinterest



Pinterest is a visual bookmarking tool that helps you discover and save creative ideas. Their mission is to help people discover the things they love, and inspire them to go do those things in their daily lives.  When BVP led the Series A investment in 2011, Pinterest was just five people working—and sometimes sleeping—in a Palo Alto Apartment that had seen better days.  Today, more than 500 Pinterest employees work in offices around the world.  Bessemer has supported the company at every stage.

Twilio, Inc.



Twilio makes communication easy and powerful. Twilio is a Communications Platform-as-a-Service providing Infrastructure APIs for developers and businesses to build scalable, communication apps in the cloud.  Since it was founded in 2007, over 700,000 web and mobile developers have used Twilio’s cloud-based platform to integrate voice, SMS and MMS capabilities into software applications.  Eager to help Jeff Lawson build the future of communications, Bessemer provided seed capital for Twilio and has continued to back the company at every stage.

OvaScience, Inc. 



OvaScience makes miracles happen. Founded in 2011, with the goal of improving the treatment of infertility, the company assembled a team of scientists, physicians and advisers that are recognized leaders in the field of reproductive medicine. In 2015, baby Zain Rajani was born.  Zain was the first baby born with the assistance of OvaScience's first product (AUGMENT) which increases the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and uses the mothers own cellular energy to revitalize her egg.  For Bessemer, backing the OvaScience founders in 2011 was an easy decision.   We’d funded Michelle Dipp, Christoph Westphal, and Rich Aldrich before.  (In fact, we’ve funded Christoph five times!)  OvaScience (NASDAQ: OVAS) became a public company in 2012.

Blue Apron



Blue Apron makes incredible home cooking easy and fun with a subscription grocery service that delivers original recipes and fresh ingredients to customers nationwide.  BVP was eager to support our and former Bessemer colleague, Matt Salzberg, with seed capital to build Blue Apron. We've continued to back the company at every stage.

Twitch 



Founded in 2011, Twitch is the world’s leading social video platform and community for gamers. Each month, more than 100 million community members gather to watch and talk about video games with more than 1.7 million broadcasters. Twitch’s video platform is the backbone of both live and on-demand distribution for the entire video game ecosystem. Bessemer first invested in Twitch in 2012 following the company’s pivot from JustinTV.  In 2014, Twitch was sold to Amazon for ~$1 billion. (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Periscope 



Periscope changed how we see the world.  Periscope is a live video streaming app developed by Kayvon Beykpour and Joe Bernstein.  The idea for Periscope was born in 2013, as Kayvon traveled abroad. He was in Istanbul when protests broke out in Taksim Square. He turned to Twitter for real-time updates but, while he could read about the protests, he was frustrated not to see them. Motivated by that experience, Kayvon and Joe started the company in February 2014.  Two months later, we provided seed capital to fund development of the app. Before launching their product, Periscope was acquired by Twitter (January 2015).   Periscope was launched in March 2015 and now has over 10 million registered users and 40 years of video watched per day.

Snapdeal.com



Snapdeal.com is India's largest e-commerce marketplace. The New Delhi-based company was started by Wharton grad Kunal Bahl, as part of the dual degree M&T Engineering and Business program at Penn, and Rohit Bansal, an alumnus of IIT Delhi in February 2010. Originally launched as a daily deals platform, the company expanded in 2011 to become an online marketplace focused on India.  Today, Snapdeal is the largest online marketplace in India offering an assortment of 10 million products across diverse categories from over 100,000 sellers, shipping to 5,000+ towns and cities in India.  In 2011, our India team made Bessemer’s first investment in Snapdeal and we’ve enjoyed watching it grow.

Bessemer Venture Partners
Bessemer backs passionate and thoughtful founders as they turn exciting ideas into market leading businesses. We admire those who aren’t afraid to break with convention and are driven to push the limits of what is possible with technology and product.







 
From seed stage to growth, and across the technology and services stack, BVP invests in enterprise, consumer and healthcare technology startups around the world.


Enterprise: We invest in all sectors including applications, B2D (D=developer), cloud/SaaS, mobile, data center, infrastructure, networking, security, Space technology and storage.


Consumer:  We invest in all sectors including mobile, marketplaces, video, social, finance, commerce and services.


Healthcare:  We invest in healthcare and related technology and services.


Our investments typically range from $100k to $75M. With $4.5B under management, we can be a patient, steady source of capital to partners as they grow.
 

We are fortunate to partner with many of today’s category leaders.
Including:

Pinterest  (BVP's first investment came in 2011 when we led their Series A. We've supported them at every stage.) 
Blue Apron (We seeded Blue Apron in 2013 and continue to back them as they grow.) 
Snapdeal (We first invested in Snapdeal in 2011 and continue to back them as they grow.)
Fuze (formerly Thinking Phones Networks) BVP First invested in 2012 and has continued to invest.

Track Record
Our track record includes 117 IPOs. Recently Twilio, Mindbody, Flex Pharma, Shopify, Box, 2U, and Wix, joined the ranks of BVP funded public companies Yelp, LinkedIn, Eloqua, Criteo and Cornerstone on Demand.  Along the way, we’ve seen a number of our most exciting and innovative startups become part of something larger. Recent examples include Periscope which sold to Twitter before they launched; Twitch, which was acquired by Amazon for ~$1B; and Skybox Imaging, which was bought by Google in 2014, marking the first—and largest acquisition to date—in the new race for Space.

Investment Strategies 













 Cloud Computing





In addition to Bessemer's long history of successful enterprise software investing, we have been particularly focused on the emergence of Cloud Computing. We believe Cloud Computing is the most important trend in the software industry of the decade. We have been fortunate to work with many of the early pioneers in this high growth market segment, and continue to invest actively to grow our current portfolio. We define Cloud Computing as the umbrella encompassing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Historically, we have been very active in the SaaS space and will continue to do so.  However, as cloud computing has expanded beyond just providing applications as a service, so has our practice.


 










 Consumer





With a history that includes early investments in Yelp, LinkedIn and Skype, Bessemer has earned a reputation for spotting fledging stars in the notably hard to predict world of consumer tech. Our current portfolio includes Pinterest (largest shareholder with investment dating back to the 2011 Series A), Blue Apron (seeded the company and the largest institutional investor) and Betterment (invested in the Series A).

We are actively investing in Mobile, Marketplaces, Video, Social, Finance, Commerce and Services. If you’re building a next-generation consumer application, please get in touch.


 










 Cyber Security





At Bessemer Venture Partners, we believe that our long history and successful track record in cyber security provide us a key advantage in identifying and assisting the most important security startups – our investors have been involved in starting or funding over forty cyber security companies over the last two decades, including eight IPOs and 15 large acquisitions.


 










 Developer Platforms





In today’s programmable world, developers embody many archetypes: they are the creators that build our software, the heroes that solve real issues, the outlaws and jesters testing the limitations of cyber security. As a result developers are now the kingmakers at large organizations empowered to make major purchasing decisions and deploy big budgets. A new ecosystem of B2D companies that bypasses traditional enterprise IT and sells directly to developers via the cloud has emerged to enable their full power and creativity.


 










 Financial Services





BVP has a long history of investment in the financial services. The 1970s saw it investing in bank services roll-ups; thereafter it moved into areas as diverse as investment services (Quadriserve, LifeHarbor, Gerson Lehrman, Motilal Oswal and Soleil) and personal banking (Truaxis, Shriram City Financial, and Zopa). Blending technology and financial expertise and experience, the partners at BVP can understand and anticipate the changes occur in this rapidly evolving sector.


 










 Healthcare





BVP has invested in healthcare-related companies for more than two decades. Drawing on our investors’ experience in medicine, science, information technology, and management, BVP has backed developers of innovative therapeutics - Isis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ISIP) and Sirtris (NASDAQ:SIRT); providers of healthcare service - VistaCare (NASDAQ:VSTA) and U.S. Behavioral Health (acquired by United Healthcare, NYSE:UBH); and suppliers of healthcare information technology - GMIS (NASDAQ:GMIS) and Allscripts (NASDAQ:MDRX). As the world's healthcare needs increase, we relish the opportunity to support entrepreneurs who will create the innovations of tomorrow.


 










 India Opportunities





India's vibrant economy offers huge potential in fulfilling demand for both domestic and export consumption. Just as BVP saw the long term opportunity when it entered Silicon Valley in the 1970s, the firm sees a similar opportunity in India driven by the growth in middle class prosperity and innovation. BVP's investment advisory team combines local knowledge and technical expertise with a global platform to help guide portfolio copmaines to global success. Since 2004, BVP has invested in 21 companies and established a 14-person Mumbai-based advisory team.


 










 Industry Software





Industry-specific cloud software companies don’t get as much attention as their horizontal brethren like Salesforce or Workday. Why? It’s been assumed that the markets they serve are simply too small and sleepy. We think that’s misguided.

While companies like Guidewire, athenahealth, DealerTrack, Veeva, Demandware, and RealPage don’t get much fanfare in the press, they are solving real problems in each of their industries. And they have quietly grown to become multi-billion-dollar publicly-traded companies.

This is just the beginning. We’re convinced that many more industries—from banking to mining to agriculture—will be transformed by ditching their legacy vendors and migrating to the cloud.


 










 Infrastructure 2.0





Bessemer has been investing in industry-leading IT infrastructure companies for close to forty years, yet we have never been more excited about the potential for innovation in this arena.  Several key technology trends and market developments promise to transform the industry (again) in the coming decade, creating the opportunity for a new set of industry leaders to emerge. 


 










 Israel Opportunities





BVP has been investing in Israel since 1992 and opened an office in Herzliya in 2007. The partners consider companies at many stages, from seed to growth, and across a number of sectors - Software, Internet, Semiconductors, Storage, Communications, and Cleantech.


 










 Marketplaces





As investors, we believe that the best business model ever conceived could be the marketplace model.  Because marketplaces benefit from powerful network effects – supply and demand follow each other – it’s often a high-stakes battle for leadership: when one marketplace achieves undisputed leadership, it can generate huge profits, retain customers and keep competitors at bay. We admire this winner-take-all (or, occasionally, winner-take-most) dynamic, and are actively evaluating marketplace investments.


 










 Mobile





Bessemer’s history in communications spans more than three decades, dating back to companies like Ungermann-Bass, which pioneered local area networking (the term “LAN” was actually coined in the living room of BVP’s Neill Brownstein).  Our investments have followed the rapid evolution of the communications landscape with many of our recent investments focused on the mobile space around the themes of mobile device penetration, the consumer experiences they enable, and the challenges these devices bring to operators.


 










 Space Tech





Throughout history, the exploration of new frontiers has yielded economic bounties in the forms of resources, living space, military advantage, and scientific research.  Today, our new frontiers lie in space, which humanity must eventually colonize for minerals, energy and new homelands. As Carl Sagan observed, “All civilizations become either space-faring, or extinct.”


 










 Video





Since the first cat video appeared on YouTube in 2005, online video has increasingly become the dominant way we consume information and entertainment. Today, YouTube has more than a billion users worldwide, Americans watch digital video for over an hour each day (twice that much for Netflix subscribers), and online video accounts for nearly three quarters of internet traffic with projections to top 85% by 2020. Just as impressive is the rapid rise and dominance of mobile video, with more than half of video views taking place on mobile devices and growing even more rapidly.

BVP’s video team is excited about a variety of types of startups that are enabling and benefitting from this major platform shift. From consumer apps like Skype, Twitch, Dropcam and Periscope, to video delivery infrastructure like Vasona and Qwilt, to video monetization platforms like Adap.tv, to enterprise video solutions like Vidyard, we are excited about the entrepreneurs that are building the future of video technology and applications.
