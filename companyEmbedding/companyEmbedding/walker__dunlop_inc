					Full Description



Walker & Dunlop, Inc., incorporated on July 29, 2010, is a holding company, which conducts its operations through Walker & Dunlop, LLC. The Company provides commercial real estate financial products and services primarily to developers and owners of multifamily properties. The Company originates, sells and services a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products, including Multifamily Finance, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Finance, Capital Markets, and Proprietary Capital. It originates and sells loans through the programs of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac, and together with Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)), the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) and the Federal Housing Administration, a division of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (together with Ginnie Mae, HUD).The Company retains servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on nearly all loans that it originates for GSE and HUD programs. It is a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) lender, a Freddie Mac seller/servicer, a Freddie Mac targeted affordable housing seller/servicer, a HUD Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender, a HUD Section 232 LEAN lender and a Ginnie Mae issuer. It is a broker and services loans for a range of life insurance companies, commercial banks, commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) issuers, and other institutional investors, in which cases it does not fund the loan but rather act as a loan broker. It also originates and holds interim loans on its balance sheet and offers investment sales brokerage services. The Company focuses primarily on multifamily properties, and offers a range of commercial real estate finance products, including first mortgage loans, second trust loans, supplemental financings, construction loans, mezzanine loans and bridge/interim loans.Multifamily FinanceThe Company participates in Fannie Mae's DUS program for multifamily, manufactured housing communities, student housing, affordable housing and certain seniors housing properties. The Company is a lender approved as a Freddie Mac Program Plus lender under, which it originates and sells to Freddie Mac multifamily, manufactured housing communities, student housing, affordable housing, and seniors housing loans. Under the program, the Company submits its completed loan underwriting package to Freddie Mac and obtains Freddie Mac's commitment to purchase the loan at a specified price after closing. The Company is also contracted by Freddie Mac to service and asset-manage all loans that it originates under its program.FHA FinanceThe Company provides construction and permanent loans to developers and owners of multifamily housing, affordable housing, seniors housing and healthcare facilities. The Company submits its completed loan underwriting package to HUD and obtains HUD's approval to originate the loan. It services and asset-manages all loans originated through HUD's various programs.Capital MarketsThe Company serves as an intermediary in the placement of commercial real estate debt between institutional sources of capital, such as life insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, pension funds, CMBS issuers and other institutional investors, and owners of all types of commercial real estate. The Company advises on capital structure, develops the financing package, facilitates negotiations between its client and institutional sources of capital, coordinates due diligence and assists in closing the transaction. In these instances, the Company acts as a loan broker. It services some of these loans.Proprietary CapitalThe Company's Proprietary Capital products include interim loans. It offers interim loans that provide floating-rate, interest-only loans for terms of up to 3 years to borrowers seeking to acquire or reposition multifamily properties that do not qualify for permanent financing (the Interim Program). It underwrites all loans originated through the Interim Program. In addition, it services and asset-manages loans originated through the Interim Program.Investment Sales Brokerage ServicesThe Company offers investment sales brokerage services to owners and developers of multifamily properties that are seeking to sell properties. Its investment sales brokerage services are offered primarily in the southeastern United States. The Company, through Walker & Dunlop Investment Sales, LLC (WDIS), conducts its investment sales operations.Direct Loan Originators and Correspondent NetworkAs of December 31, 2016, the Company originated loans through loan originators operating out of 28 offices nationwide. Its loan originators collect and analyze financial and property information, assist the borrowers in submitting information required to complete a loan application, and help the borrower in closing the loan. As of December 31, 2016, it had correspondent agreements with 24 independently owned mortgage banking companies across the country with which the Company had relationships for GSE and HUD loan originations. The Company's correspondents assist it in evaluating loans, including pre-screening the borrowers, key principals and properties for program eligibility, coordinating due diligence, and providing market intelligence.Underwriting and Risk ManagementThe Company uses various tools to manage its Fannie Mae risk-sharing exposure. These tools include an underwriting and approval process, evaluating, and modifying its underwriting criteria given the underlying multifamily housing market fundamentals, limiting its geographic, borrower and principal exposures, and using modified risk-sharing under the Fannie Mae DUS program.The Company's underwriting process begins with a review of suitability for its investors and a detailed review of the borrower, key principals and the property. It reviews a borrower's financial statements for minimum net worth and liquidity requirements, as well as obtaining credit and criminal background checks. It also reviews a borrower's and principals' operating track record, including evaluating the performance of other properties owned by the applicable borrower and key principals. It also considers the borrower's and key principals' bankruptcy and foreclosure history. It reviews the fundamental value and credit profile of the underlying property, including an analysis of regional economic trends, appraisals of the property, and reviews of historical and prospective financials. Third-party vendors are engaged for appraisals, engineering reports, environmental reports, flood certification reports, zoning reports and credit reports.Servicing and Asset ManagementThe Company services all loans that it originates for the GSEs, HUD, and its Proprietary Capital products and some of the loans for which it acts as a broker for institutional investors, primarily life insurance companies. It is an approved servicer for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD loans. Its servicing function includes loan servicing and asset management activities, such as carrying out all cashiering functions relating to the loan, including providing monthly billing statements to the borrower and collecting and applying payments on the loan; administering reserve and escrow funds for repairs, tenant improvements, taxes and insurance; obtaining and analyzing financial statements of the borrower and performing periodic property inspections; preparing and providing periodic reports and remittances to the GSEs, investors, master servicers, or other designated persons, and administering lien filings. It also outsources some of its servicing activities to a subservicer.The Company competes with Wells Fargo, N.A., CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Marcus & Millichap, Inc., HFF, Inc., PNC Real Estate, Northmarq Capital, LLC, Berkeley Point Capital and Berkadia Commercial Mortgage, LLC.

Jun 1 17
Walker & Dunlop, Inc. announced that it arranged a $43,500,000 refinance loan with Fannie Mae for The Tennyson at Crescent Village, a newly constructed, Class A, townhouse- and loft-style property in Eugene, Oregon. Led by Ralph Lowen and Steve Natale, the company's team obtained approval to provide near-stabilization financing to retire the project's short-term construction debt. Completed in early 2017, the 263-unit property experienced rapid lease-up and was 80% occupied at the time of rate lock. Loan features include a 10-year term and 30-year amortization at 70% loan to value. The borrower intends to use the loan proceeds to pay off two existing loans. The property also received a significant spread reduction by qualifying for a Green Building Certification through the Green Globes program. Located in Crescent Village, Eugene's first master-planned urban village, the 35-building apartment complex offers residents one-, two-, and three-bedroom units along with top-of-the-line amenities on-site and easy walkability to both employment and local services. The Tennyson at Crescent Village features a clubhouse with a brew station and a fully-equipped fitness center with on-demand classes, racquetball courts, a swimming pool, and hot tub.

What Makes WD a Compelling Investment

- Walker & Dunlop provides a broad range of financing solutions for 
            every type of commercial real estate asset, including short term bridge 
            financing as well as investment sales services for 
            multifamily properties. Over the next three years, at least $300 billion of 
            multifamily financing volume is forecasted for each year, and Walker 
            & Dunlop's national scale and reputation positions it well to capitalize on this growing market opportunity.


- Walker & Dunlop has impressive scale and market presence in the multifamily 
            space and has steadily grown its market share with Fannie Mae & Freddie 
            Mac, the two largest providers of capital to the multifamily market; 
            from 2012 to 2016, Walker & Dunlop increased its market share from 9.5% 
            to 10.8% and 4.6% to 10.4% with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac respectively. 
            Walker & Dunlop is the #2 Fannie Mae DUS® Lender, #3 Freddie Mac Multifamily Approved Seller, and the #4 Multifamily HUD Lender in the country.
- A large servicing portfolio provides a stable and durable source of 
            cash flow and income, ensuring financial flexibility. As of March 31, 2017, 86% of the servicing fees were protected from the risk prepayment.
- Walker & Dunlop ended 2016 with nearly $119 million 
            in cash and plans to deploy its capital to grow its interim loan 
            portfolio, expand its headcount of loan origination and investment sales professionals throughout

- In April, 2017, Walker & Dunlop entered a joint venture with Blackstone Mortgage Trust to originate, hold, and finance multifamily bridge loans.

- Walker & Dunlop has a strong track record of growth and an experienced 
            management team fully aligned to drive shareholder value.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

In April 2015, Walker & Dunlop expanded its breadth of service offerings, entering the Investment Sales market through the acquisition of Engler Financial Group, one of the nation’s leading multifamily brokerage platforms. The foundation of the newly formed entity, Walker & Dunlop Investment Sales (WDIS), is built upon a rich history of representing the nation’s premier owners and developers of multifamily properties in their capital raise and disposition efforts. WDIS leverages extensive relationships within the institutional investment arena with Walker & Dunlop’s market leading finance platform to provide the highest level of multifamily advisory in the country. 

WDIS operates with these fundamental core values:

Quality over Quantity Business Model
Act as a Multifamily Advisor, not simply a Broker
Client service is paramount, constant communication is a must
Dedicated to providing a more thoughtful approach to the marketing process
Play an active role in every assignment, from day one of the engagement all the way through closing

Over time, WDIS has implemented these core values to build a client list which includes the nation’s premier multifamily investors,
developers and operators. View a sampling of our recent transactions.
