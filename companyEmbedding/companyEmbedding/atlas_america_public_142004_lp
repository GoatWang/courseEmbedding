Atlas Travel® Insurance 
Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Pre-existing conditions — charges resulting directly or indirectly from any pre-existing condition, as herein defined, are excluded from this insurance unless it is a sudden and unexpected outbreak or recurrence that is of short duration and requires urgent care. Under Atlas Travel®, no coverage is available for known, scheduled, required, or expected medical care, drugs, or treatments existent or necessary prior to the effective date of coverage.
Routine medical examinations
Routine pre-natal care, pregnancy, child birth, and post-natal care

Does Atlas Travel® provide any coverage while I am in my home country?
Atlas Travel® does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:

                                                Benefit Period –Atlas Travel® will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.

                                                Incidental Home Country Coverage – For U.S. citizens, medical expenses are only covered during incidental trips home totaling no more than 15 days per three-month period of coverage. Incidental visit time must be used within the three-month period earned, and the member must continue his or her international trip in order to be eligible for this benefit. Medical expenses for non-U.S. citizens will be covered up to a maximum of 30 days for any three-month period. Medical expenses incurred in your home country will not be covered if your purpose for returning to your home country is to obtain treatment of an illness or injury that began while traveling. 
Will Atlas Travel® cover me on trips of a year or longer?
For non-U.S. citizens or residents whose travel does not include the U.S. or U.S. territories, the maximum coverage duration is 365 days. Additionally, coverage may be renewed up to 2 additional coverage periods. Coverage renewal requires satisfaction of a new deductible and coinsurance. Renewals may be filed through the Client Zone.
                                                For all other travelers, the maximum duration is 364 days, and coverage is not renewable.

Table of Contents  General  Atlas America Public #14-2004 L.P. ("we", "us", or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on May 3, 2004 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP").

 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), for administrative services.  Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce natural gas and oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through third-party gas gathering systems. We do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:   well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;   reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and   preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of March 31, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2013 and 2012, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 2012 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 323 $ 361 Oil 71 62 Liquids 2 7 Total $ 396 $ 430 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) (1) 999 1,217 Oil (bbl/day) (1) 8 7 Liquids (bbl/day) (1) 1 2 Total (mcfe/day) (1) 1,053 1,271 Average sales prices: (2) Gas (per mcf) (1) (3) $ 3.89 $ 3.71 Oil (per bbl) (1) $ 92.37 $ 99.92 Liquids (per bbl) (1) $ 57.44 $ 40.58 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 77 % 78 % Per mcfe (1) $ 3.21 $ 2.92 Depletion per mcfe $ 3.00 $ 1.69  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to mcfe using the ratio of six mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $26,900 and $49,800 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $322,900 and $360,800 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $37,900 (11%). The $37,900 decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $67,700 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by an increase of $29,800 in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions. Our production volumes decreased to 999 mcf per day for the three months ended March 31, 2013 from 1,217 mcf per day for the three months ended March 31, 2012, a decrease of 218 mcf per day (18%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $70,500 and 62,300 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $8,200 (13%). The $8,200 increase in oil revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $14,000 increase in production volumes, partially offset by a $5,800 decrease in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes increased to 8 bbls per day for the three months ended March 31, 2013 from 7 bbls per day for the three months ended March 31, 2012, an increase of 1 bbl per day (14%).  Table of Contents  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquid revenues were $2,400 and $7,400 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $5,000 (68%). The $5,000 decrease in natural gas liquid revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributed to a $5,700 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $700 increase in our natural gas liquid prices, which were driven by market conditions. Our production volume decreased to 1 bbl per day for the three months ended March 31, 2013 from 2 bbls per day for the three months ended March 31, 2012, a decrease of 1 bbl per day (50%).  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $304,500 and $337,100 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $32,600 (10%). This increase was mostly attributable to a decrease in well supervision fees due to wells being temporarily shut-in for repairs and maintenance.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 72% and 45% for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were $57,500 and $63,900, respectively, a decrease of $6,400 (10%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The decreases for the three months ended March 31, 2013 is primarily due to a decrease in third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $138,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2013 to $66,700 as compared to $204,700 for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This decrease was due to a decrease in net earnings before depletion, net of non-cash loss on derivative value and accretion of $18,700, a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $110,200 and a $18,300 decrease in the cost incurred to plug wells, partially offset by an increase in the change in accrued liabilities of $9,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012.  Cash provided by investing activities was $5,500 and $12,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 due to the sale of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities decreased $178,100 during the three months ended March 31, 2013 to $63,600 from $241,700 for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from third-parties.  The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Atlas Travel® Insurance 
Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Does Atlas Travel® provide any coverage while I am in my home country?
Atlas Travel® does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:

                                                Benefit Period –Atlas Travel® will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.

                                                Incidental Home Country Coverage – For U.S. citizens, medical expenses are only covered during incidental trips home totaling no more than 15 days per three-month period of coverage. Incidental visit time must be used within the three-month period earned, and the member must continue his or her international trip in order to be eligible for this benefit. Medical expenses for non-U.S. citizens will be covered up to a maximum of 30 days for any three-month period. Medical expenses incurred in your home country will not be covered if your purpose for returning to your home country is to obtain treatment of an illness or injury that began while traveling. 
Will Atlas Travel® cover me on trips of a year or longer?
For non-U.S. citizens or residents whose travel does not include the U.S. or U.S. territories, the maximum coverage duration is 365 days. Additionally, coverage may be renewed up to 2 additional coverage periods. Coverage renewal requires satisfaction of a new deductible and coinsurance. Renewals may be filed through the Client Zone.
                                                For all other travelers, the maximum duration is 364 days, and coverage is not renewable. 
How do I cancel my Atlas Travel® coverage?
You may submit a written cancellation request to HCCMIS prior to the effective date of coverage for a full refund. If HCCMIS receives the cancellation request following the effective date of coverage, only the unused portion of premium will be refunded. A $25 cancellation fee will apply.
Will Atlas Travel® cover multiple trips? 
No. Atlas Travel® coverage is purchased for a duration you specify and applies to a single trip only. For coverage that applies to multiple trips, our Atlas MultiTrip™ product may work for you. 
Are there any countries not covered in my Atlas Travel® plan? 
Yes. Certain travel restrictions declared by the U.S. State Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and certain OFAC sanctions, affect Atlas Travel® coverage.
