Fitch to Rate Fifth Third Auto Trust 2015-1; Issues Presale | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Fifth Third Auto Trust 2015-1; Issues Presale
    





October 22, 2015 09:07 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following expected ratings and Outlooks 
      to the following notes issued by Fifth Third Auto Trust 2015-1:
    

      --$187,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf(EXP)';
    

      --$224,000,000 classes A-2A and A-2B 'AAAsf(EXP)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$264,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf(EXP)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$75,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf(EXP)'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Credit Quality: The pool is generally consistent with those of 
      recently issued FITAT transactions, exhibiting a weighted average FICO 
      score of 754 with no scores below 650. The pool also benefits from 15 
      months of seasoning and includes a diverse pool mix from a make/model 
      and geographic perspective.
    

      Extended Term/Used Vehicle Exposure: The pool does include heavy 
      concentrations in loans over five years (76.6%), notably 4.8% of 84 
      month loans. Additionally, used vehicle loans total 49.6%, which could 
      expose the pool to higher loss severity.
    

      Sufficient CE Structure: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes is 4.50% (target of 5.00%). Under Fitch's analysis, the 
      structure is able to support stressed losses commensurate with the 
      expected ratings, given the base case loss expectation of 1.10%.
    

      Improved Loss Performance: Losses on Fifth Third's auto loan portfolio 
      and recent securitizations have declined significantly from peak levels 
      in 2006 to 2008 due to strong underwriting standards and improved credit 
      quality.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates leading to moderately higher loss rates, 
      which has been accounted for in the derivation of Fitch's base case loss 
      expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing: Fitch believes Fifth 
      Third demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer to service FITAT 2015-1.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Fifth Third would not impair the 
      timeliness of the payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of Fifth Third Auto Trust 2015-1 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes 
      display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In fact, they 
      could lead to potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence 
      focused on comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 
      125 loans from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this 
      information in its analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on 
      our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch 
      in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link 
      contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary (RAC).
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in Fifth Third Auto Trust 2015-1 - Appendix'. 
      These R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      June 2015.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms 4 Classes of Fifth Third Auto Trust 2015-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook StableHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.06-3.36 (-0.14%)Dow 3021,829.90+33.35 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)Fitch Affirms 4 Classes of Fifth Third Auto Trust 2015-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook StableBusiness WireOctober 12, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed the four outstanding classes of Fifth Third Auto Trust 2015-1. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement (CE) and loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and CE, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents.The ratings reflect the quality of Fifth Third Bank's retail auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing capabilities, and the sound financial and legal structure of the transactions.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes.In its initial review of the transaction, Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to the class A notes of Fifth Third Auto Trust 2015-1 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minor sensitivity to increased defaults and losses under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario; however, the class A notes could experience a downgrade of up to one rating category under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:--Class A-2A notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-2B notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879815Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1012993Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1012993Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.Read MoreThe information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
