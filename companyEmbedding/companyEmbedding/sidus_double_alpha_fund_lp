April 2017 – What Matters?

What Matters?
Kelly Conway @ Mattersight | Fail












Month: April 2017 


Today’s Volume — And Price Action — Explained 

When the NASDAQ OTC markets opened trading this morning, Mattersight’s  SEC Form S-3 resale registration statement was effective. It actually was declared effective by the SEC, after the markets closed on Wednesday night. So today’s higher volume is likely at least some of those shares, finding new homes.
And the steady down-beat, in MATR’s per share pricing, is likely at least in part the excess supply such an event unleashes on an otherwise rather thinly traded stock.
But to be sure, most of the recent action is likely market dread, over Q1 2017’s impending per share GAAP losses from operations. I’m guessing like $0.20 per share — and it is really just a guess. But I do think that Lake Street’s ($0.15) of GAAP losses is likely far too optimistic.
We will know in about ten days.
 





Stock At $3.25; Q1 2017 Results Call Now May 9, 2017 

Not too much else needs to be said — except that I expect more GAAP losses from operations.
The polly-anna-ish Lake Street Capital Markets analysts have previously called for a loss of only $0.15 per share. I say it will be more like ($0.20/share), on a GAAP basis.
Here’s the item:
…Mattersight announced that it intends to release its first quarter 2017 financial results after the market close on Tuesday, May 9, 2017. Mattersight management also plans to host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017.
The conference call and slide presentation will be available at the Investor Relations section of Mattersight’s website at http://www.mattersight.com/about-us/investor-relations/. To listen to the conference call via telephone, please call 800.952.4789 (domestic) or 404.665.9579 (international), conference ID: 10151911.
For those who cannot access the live broadcast, a replay of the conference call will be available beginning approximately two hours after the live call is completed on May 9, 2017, by dialing 855.859.2056 (domestic) or 404.537.3406 (international), conference ID: 10151911….
Be very careful out there. The resale S-3 is not yet effective — that overhang isn’t factored in yet.





[U] Short Interest Is Up 17 Per Cent, Going Into Q1 2017 Results Call… Stock Closes At $3.30 (04.20.2017). 

UPDATED: 04.20.17 @ 4PM EDT — Bob cogently adds the below — and the stock closes at $3.30 today.
…I’d say the short interest position is based on profiting from the likely erosion of value in the loss carry-forward should corporate income tax rates be reduced in the August timeframe. It’s not part of a downside protection scheme. To do that, you need an active options market, of which, there is minimal for MATR.
Add to this the worrying moves in the executive ranks and the shifting storyline, likely foretelling a disappointing Q1….
[End, updated portion.]
In addition, the trading volume “to cover shorts” stands at 22 days — or it would take 22 plus days of ordinary volume trading to cover the number of shares short, in Mattersight at the moment.
Two logical explanations — for the rising short tide — include (i) some of the selling shareholders in the SEC filed Form S-3 may already have arrangements with Craig-Hallum or others, which effectively require those houses to lay off the risk of a market decline, by shorting the stock in advance of S-3 effectiveness; and (ii) more probably, a general lack of confidence in the company’s ability to deliver on its previously announced financial commitments, during Q1 2017.
We will know for certain before too terribly long, but you can run a Google search to find the auto-bot stories on “Mattersight Short Interest”.
They are poorly written, but accurately crunch the daily trading data, on the NASDAQ OTC.
Now you know — be careful out there.





And Now… The Complete Listing Of Private Placement Purchasers — At $3/Share… 


UPDATED: 05.16.2017 @ 6 PM CDT — Hilariously, Mattersight’s lawyers incorrectly reported one of the selling stockholder’s identities — so the company had to file an amended sticker to the prospectus overnight:
…We are filing this prospectus supplement to reflect that the record holder of 100,000 shares of our common stock to be offered for resale under the Prospectus is Patrick Lin, rather than Primarius Capital. The Prospectus inadvertently assigned only beneficial ownership to Mr. Lin when he is in fact the record holder of such shares. This prospectus supplement does not impact any other selling stockholders set forth in the table appearing under the caption “Selling Stockholders” on page 5 of the Prospectus, which we refer to herein as the Selling Stockholder Table….
This is entirely trivial, but emblematic I think — of the lack of careful review, of most sorts — at the company, generally. [End, Updated Portion.]
For existing shareholders, this was [another] slap in the face.
A new round of highly dilutive equity, to select investors, on a private basis — at $3 a share. When the stock was trading on the NASDAQ at around half a buck higher than that. I’ll not list how many shares each proposes to resell, that’s in the S-3 table, as well — I’ll just list how many each bought. But I should say that when the S-3 is declared effective, it is likely there will be downward pressure, on the NASDAQ stock price — for MATR, as a majority have filed for the right to sell all they own.
One might expect that sort of nonsense in a tech start-up, just getting its legs under it — not a seasoned issuer, with 17 years experience as a registered ’34 Act reporting public company. Sheesh.
My formatting isn’t stellar (cleaning it up — on the fly, now), but here are the people and institutions who bought in — at $3 — and how many shares each holds:

Back From The Coastal Jet Run… Kudos To Pseudonym-Commenter Joe Maddon! 

One of our own regulars — as commenters go — spells his name unlike the Cubs’ skipper, but phonetically very much like it.  This is a sincere thank you to him, for pointing us to this, while we were traveling for clients. [H/T to LinkedIn, too. . .]
It seems that two fine former Mattersight executives have re-united — over at Corel. [Our backgrounder, on one of them.] So the talent drain at Mattersight continues, unabated.
Here is the full press release, from Corel:
…Corel announces the recent, first quarter executive team appointments of Chris Carsen as General Counsel and Jason Wesbecher as Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing.
Chris Carsen, General Counsel
Chris Carsen is Corel’s General Counsel, leading the company’s contracting, intellectual property, litigation, and compliance operations globally. With 20 years of experience in information technology law, Chris is skilled at mitigating corporate risk while keeping a keen eye on shareholder value. Prior to joining Corel, Chris served as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary for Mattersight, where she led the structuring and negotiation of complex SaaS transactions with Fortune 500 enterprises, as well as intellectual property management, SEC compliance, corporate governance, and board governance. Chris was previously a partner at Winston & Strawn LLP, focusing on information-technology transactions, privacy matters, and other corporate and commercial contracts. Chris earned her J.D. from Cornell Law School.
Jason Wesbecher, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing
Jason Wesbecher is Corel’s Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing and leads the company’s global sales organization. With more than 20 years working in the B2B software industry, Jason is an enterprise evangelist with a passion for tech and delivering outstanding customer experiences. Previously, Jason served as Chief Marketing Officer and EVP of Customer Acquisition at Mattersight and also founded Docket, a sales enablement software company backed by Austin Ventures and First Round Capital. He also helped guide Jive Software through an IPO and has held sales leadership positions at eLoyalty, Siebel Systems, TIBCO Software and Trilogy. Jason has a BA in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
“2016 was a milestone year for Corel as we acquired Mindjet and bolstered our strength serving enterprise customers. We’re focused on the tremendous opportunities we see to build on our B2B business while continuing to leverage Corel’s global presence and our robust network of partners,” said Patrick Nichols, CEO of Corel. “Chris and Jason are both exceptional leaders with solid expertise in the enterprise market. We’re excited to have them join the Corel team as we execute our next chapter of growth….”
Fascinating. Now you know, thanks to “Joe”! I’m totally exhausted. Crashing now.
 





Proxy Is On File At SEC EDGAR Window… 

I’m on the road, so do go read all the piggy payments to the CEO, for yourself. It seems he earned a cash bonus, and more equity bonuses, for missing estimated GAAP LPS  — on the low side (i.e., losses too large) — for three of the last four quarters.
Disgusting. 
Here it is. I’m out until late Friday…

Proxy Is On File At SEC EDGAR Window… 

I’m on the road, so do go read all the piggy payments to the CEO, for yourself. It seems he earned a cash bonus, and more equity bonuses, for missing estimated GAAP LPS  — on the low side (i.e., losses too large) — for three of the last four quarters.
Disgusting. 
Here it is. I’m out until late Friday…





Preposterous! For The Ump-teeth Time, Mattersight To “Revamp” Its Business Model?!? 

VentureBeat is this afternoon reporting the following — in a rather breathless tone, from VP Andrew Traba (and as a side-note — to my eye, that’s another new name, in the Mattersight roster of seemingly endless VPs of… whatever!):
…As people begin to think about how they feel about ads on intelligent assistants, voice analytics company Mattersight is planning to use unique voice signatures to deliver personalized advertisements and bots. Using artificial intelligence to recognize your personality within 30 seconds, Mattersight wants to deliver personalized ads and bots to Amazon Echo, Google Home, and other voice-controlled devices….
“We know how words or language correlate with personality styles. We ultimately think of ourselves fitting into that landscape, as we’re going to train bots how to be empathetic,” said Mattersight VP of data science Andrew Traba.
Mattersight assigns personality profiles to the people who call major brands, and it wants to bring that same service to intelligent assistants, using voice biometrics as an identifier instead of phone numbers….
[As I’ve long intoned, I very sincerely doubt that Google or Amazon need MATR’s algorithms (despite the showy business method patents!) — in order to do this on their own. But whatever. Most of this junk is public domain 1970s NASA tech.]
And, well — I guess this indicates that (once again!) CEO Conway cannot find a path to profitability, on the current business model.
That has been the main business model “only” since 2012-2013. Prior to that, the model from 2007 to 2011 failed (and was largely sold back to the old parent, under the prior eLoyalty name). Prior to that, the pure call center model never delivered a profitable quarter, in what was over a decade.
So here we sit — coming into mid-2017… Mattersight went public in 2000.
And still it has no idea what it will be, if it can ever… grow up. Ugh.
Oh… and… Yes — this is the quarterly “shiny object“, always used to deflect another quarter of GAAP losses per share, as Q1 2017 is closed out this afternoon at 5 PM CDT.
More — over the weekend. I’m off for some outdoor fun!
 





We Said We’d Let You Know… 

…when we felt it likely that Craig-Hallum was ending its role, in stabilizing the market for Mattersight’s common stock, on the NASDAQ OTC, post the private placement of February 23, 2017.
In view of the smallish volumes over the last few days, and generally flat to declining NASDAQ prices, we think the market stabilization effort has gone into hibernation.
Said another way, many of the holders who are friendly to Mattersight, and were looking to change or rearrange their positions, as a result of (or in response to) the highly dilutive 2017 $16 million private placement — have likely now done so.
It is my expectation that if there are short sellers out there, with open option or direct short positions, we will see them emerge in the coming days and weeks.
Next big event: the proxy filing with the SEC’s EDGAR window, which will list any related party transactions in excess of $60,000, and the full orgy of excesses that makes up the executive team’s 2016-2017 compensation package(s).
Onward. Oh, and happy (belated) St. Patrick’s.
