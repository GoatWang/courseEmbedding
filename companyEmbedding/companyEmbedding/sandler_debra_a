Candymaker Mars Names Sandler Chief Health Officer
Move Comes as Big Food Marketers Face More Nutrition Scrutiny


	By  

E.J. Schultz.
	

	
	
 Published on July 08, 2014. 


















Most Popular






 


Debra Sandler is leaving her post as president of Mars Chocolate North America to take a global role overseeing the company's health initiatives.
The newly created position, called chief health and well being officer, exemplifies the emphasis big consumer packaged-food companies are putting on nutrition in the face of increasing scrutiny by consumers and health activists.
Tracey Massey, who is currently chief financial officer for Mars Global Chocolate, will take over as acting president for Mars Chocolate North America. Ms. Massey, a longtime Mars employee, is expected to be approved to take over the position on a permanent basis, said Mars spokeswoman Renee Kopkowski.
In the global role, Ms. Sandler will oversee initiatives for Mars Inc., which includes chocolate brands as well as food brands like Uncle Ben's and the company's Wm. Wrigley Jr. division, whose brands include Skittles and Orbit gum. 
Ms. Sandler gained notice last year when she called on candymakers to be more aggressive in dealing with obesity. "If we don't [act], I worry that someone else will do it for us … Don't wait for regulators to tell us what to do," she said during a presentation at the National Confectioners Association's State of the Industry Conference, according to an account in Phillymag.com.
At Mars Chocolate North America, Ms. Sandler helped lead the launch of Goodnessknows, a regional brand containing slow-roasted whole almonds, fruits and toasted oats that "have no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives," according to the brand.
Ms. Kopkowski said it is too early to detail the initiatives Ms. Sandler will oversee in her new role.

Debra Sandler has been president of Mars Chocolate North America since March 2012. She joined Mars in 2009 as chief consumer officer. Before that, she spent 11 years at Johnson & Johnson, serving as Worldwide President of McNeil Nutritionals, maker of products including Splenda, and Worldwide Franchise Vice President for women's health. She also spent more than a decade with PepsiCo in various executive positions.
Why did you choose Hofstra? In many respects, Hofstra chose me in that I was very interested in a career in international business. I wanted to combine my interest in business with my love of languages and when I was looking for colleges, there were not too many at that time that offered programs in international business. I came from the Caribbean and I was very interested in coming to a school where I could build strong relationships, and Hofstra as a mid-sized school offered that. I personally felt that I would function better in an environment where I could build a relationship with my teachers, get to know them and have them get to know me.
What are some of your best memories of your time at Hofstra? I think what I remember most is my involvement in school – I was an R.A. my senior year, I ran on a ticket for student government and I was president of the African-Caribbean Society. I really felt a part of the school and a part of the culture.


Debra Sandler, '82, B.B.A.President, Mars Chocolate North America




"I think to get people to follow, you've got to inspire. "

And it was where I had my first exposure to activism. We wanted the university to divest of investments in South Africa. We had a sit-in.  I remember being very nervous about it. We sat in at the president’s office. I’m not sure how long we sat in – it felt like forever. Sometime after that, the university did divest. I think back on that time, and I think what it did is reinforce that you can change things. And I sort of live by that to this day. If you’re unhappy about something, then do something about it.
Were there any Zarb professors who were mentors, who inspired you? One of my absolute favorites was Professor (Rusty) Moore for international business. When you’re young and you think you like something and then you start learning about it and you realize – I really do love it. Professor Moore was someone who fueled my love and passion for international business. Professor (Louis) Benton, who I had for Management 101, was also one those professors I went back to many times because he was just always a good sounding board. I believe he told us – and it’s something I live by and recommend – when you’re choosing companies, choose those where your opportunities grow as you rise in the organization. It was one of the things, as I considered which companies to go to, that I would think about.
You are a working mother who has successfully ascended the corporate ladder at several companies. What is your take on the debate over work-life balance, and the relative lack of woman leaders in corporate America, as framed by Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg in her book, Lean In?  I think many women feel balance is a destination, that at some point you arrive at balance and that’s it. For me, balance is something I work on every week and every day. I am very, very clear about my priorities. There are times when work will be more important than things going on at home and there are some things at home that I will never trade off on.  I remember once I had a very big business dinner with my boss, the customer and the senior leadership team on the same evening as the science fair. I told her “I’ll be in the meeting all day and I will do everything that’s needed but I can’t be there for the evening dinner.” I really wrestled over it but when I told my boss, she said “Ok.” It wasn’t as big an issue as I maybe made it in my mind. It did help that my boss was a woman, but I’ve had the same type of conversations with male bosses. I don’t do it all the time, but I do it for the things that are important to me. So I absolutely say lean in – nobody else is going to do it for you.
What makes a good leader? Fundamentally, if you’re a leader, you have to be someone that people will follow. I think to get people to follow, you’ve got to inspire. You have to touch people’s hearts and capture their imaginations. It’s someone who is clear about the landscape – what we are working toward – as well as how we get there together.
What’s your leadership style? Collaborative.  As a leader you have to sometimes stop and follow. You don’t always have to be out in front. There are times when I’m going to be out front and sometimes I’m very comfortable to let someone else be out front. A good leader can share and be generous with their leadership.
How has your leadership style changed over the years? Patience is the biggest change. I honestly don’t know what I was rushing to – but I was in a big hurry as a younger person. It was very much “when’s the next promotion?”  I spent 13 great years at PepsiCo but in that time, I probably had about eight jobs so I got used to a pretty fast pace and enjoyed that. Over time, what I’ve come to prefer is to stay in an assignment long enough to lap the decisions I made the year before. It’s not just the doing of the thing this year, but seeing the lasting impact of the decisions. Early on in your career, it’s more about your contribution, your work, your product. As you evolve, it’s less about you and more about the people around you, more about the people you are able to cultivate and grow.
You’re a member of Hofstra’s Board of Trustees. What is it like to help guide policy and development for your alma mater?  It’s a little strange for me and never stranger than just a couple of months ago when I was asked to speak at the graduation for the business school. It took me back to when I was sitting in that audience, graduating. I just have really fond memories of the school and want more people to know about it and what it offers.  I’d just love to see more people consider Hofstra as a choice. In my view, it’s right there and not everybody knows about us – and we have so much to offer.
Compare Hofstra today, with the Hofstra you attended. I’m impressed how the school has grown and taken itself seriously. They haven’t rested on their laurels, they are staying contemporary and modern and relevant. My nephew is a sophomore at Zarb now and I feel like the school has gotten much bigger and even more diverse than when I was there. My nephew – he was in a dorm with someone from the Philippines, someone from Malaysia and someone from New Jersey. That kind of experience is everything.
I really remain committed to Hofstra – I try to give people the benefit of my perspective and be a proud alum. Whenever I’m asked to go back and speak, I do.  And when I look for interns, I’m very concerned about getting Hofstra interns here.

Sandler's Leadership SolutionsBetter leaders mean a brighter future 




coaching, training, mentoring What are the qualities of Leadership?Leadership isn't just wielding power; fear is one of the least productive tools for motivating people to perform well. True leadership is providing guidance through the exercise of authority that has been earned.

Through Sandler’s Coaching Program you’ll learn how to identify and unlock the performance code of each individual on your team, and maximize their performance. Coaches






Leadership isn’t the result of any particular management processIts not an extension of the manager's authority as defined by the corporate hierarchy.  It's the manner by which a process is implemented—the attitudinal qualities the manager brings to everyday interactions. 






Successful managers must be able to effectively...Support corporate initiatives through the accomplishment of department goals.Channel their people’s efforts in the appropriate directions in order to accomplish those goals.Acquire specialized knowledge and skills relevant to managing people and helping them accomplish predictable results.



Effective leaders must build on those managerial skills, plus...Have an instinctual understanding about human nature, and why people act the way that they do.Be able to observe their peoples’ behavior, analyze and respond to it in an objective, supportive, and constructive manner.Encourage, enable and recognize their people for their performance.

Sandler joined Mars in 2009 as chief consumer officer for Mars Chocolate North America and was promoted to president in 2012. Prior to joining Mars, Sandler served as worldwide president for McNeil’s Nutritionals, LLC, with Johnson & Johnson. She will report to David Kamenetzky, vp corporate affairs and strategic initiatives, and will work closely with the Mars Leadership Team and Board of Directors. 
Massey is taking on Sandler’s role in leading Mars Chocolate North America as acting president, she was formerly CFO of Mars Global Chocolate. 
“Tracey has done a superb job of leading Strategy & Finance for the global Chocolate business for more than five years,” says Reid. “During her time as Chocolate CFO, Tracey has demonstrated particular excellence in shaping the vision and strategy, and has led our Chocolate growth in emerging markets across the world.” 
In her 24-year career with Mars, Massey has worked in the U.S. for 12 years, as a plant director and in business planning for the Mars Petfood business, and more recently as the CFO for the Mars U.S. Snackfood business. Prior to moving to the U.S., Massey held various positions in manufacturing and finance in the drinks and electronics divisions of Mars in Europe.
