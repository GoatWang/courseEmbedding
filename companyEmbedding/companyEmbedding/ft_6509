Product Overview
Cisco introduces the Cisco® Catalyst® 6500 Enhanced Series Chassis (6500-E Series) delivering up to 2 terabits per second of system bandwidth capacity and 80 Gbps of per-slot bandwidth. In a system configured for VSS, this translates to a system capacity of 4 Tbps. The Cisco® Catalyst® 6500 Enhanced Series Chassis will be capable of delivering up to 180 Gbps of per-slot bandwidth with a system capacity of up to 4 terabits per second. A system configured for VSS will be capable of delivering up to 8 Tbps of system bandwidth.
The Cisco Catalyst 6500-E Series Switch offers the broadest range of interface modules with industry-leading performance and advanced feature integration. The Cisco Catalyst 6500-E Series Switch also offers high port densities and comes in 3-, 4-, 6-, 9, 9-Vertical, and 13-slot versions that make it ideal for a range of deployment scenarios.
The Cisco Catalyst 6500-E Series Chassis provides superior investment protection by supporting multiple generations of products in the same chassis, lowering the total cost of ownership. The Cisco Catalyst 6500-E Series Chassis (Figure 1) supports all the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Supervisor Engines up to and including the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Supervisor Engine 2T, and associated LAN, WAN, and services modules.

                    Twin Hickory is oh so conveniently located in the northwestern corner of Henrico County in an area commonly known to local folks as Glen Allen. Residents enjoy easy access to interstate travel north to Washington, west to Charlottesville, a quick 20 minute car ride to the airport AND a quick trip downtown to enjoy our thriving capital city, Richmond! If you decide to make this planned community, Twin Hickory offers 18 unique neighborhoods with over 1400 single family, town homes and condominium homes with home resale prices ranging from the low 200s to the upper 800s.  The homes are mostly transitional open concept styles so perfectly suited for today's busy lifestyles. Almost 8 miles of sidewalks and  walking trails connect the various neighborhoods along with abundant mature trees, ponds with fountains, and green spaces all add to this vibrant community.  The sidewalks also allow students to walk to Twin Hickory Elementary School, Deep Run High School, the Twin Hickory public library and the Lake House all within the community! When Memorial Day arrives the fun really begins with the opening of the large community outdoor pool which is centered around the Lake House and offers a lap pool, dive pool, water-side and toddler pool plus a competitive swim team and, of course, swin lessons.  Tennis courts are available year round plus in season lessons and clinics are offered by the community tennis pro.
