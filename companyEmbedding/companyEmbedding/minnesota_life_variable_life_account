      An annuity is a long-term, tax deferred investment vehicle designed for

      and if withdrawn before age 59 ½, may be subject to a 10% federal tax 
      penalty. If the annuity will fund an IRA or other tax qualified plan, 
      the tax-deferral feature offers no additional value. Not FDIC/NCUA 
      insured. Not bank guaranteed. Not insured by any Federal Government 
      Agency. There are charges and expenses associated with annuities, such 
      as deferred sales charges for early withdrawals. Variable annuities have 
      additional expenses such as mortality and expense risk, administrative 
      charges, investment management fees and rider fees. Variable annuities 
      are subject to market fluctuation, investment risk and loss of principal.

								Our products
							
Whether offered as basic or voluntary plans, group insurance products are the mainstay of most benefits programs.

Group Term Life
Group Term Life insurance provides protection for a specific period of time. It pays a benefit only if the insured dies during the term. There is no cash value buildup in a term life insurance policy.
View the video 
Group Universal Life (GUL)
GUL combines the protection of life insurance with the option to build savings through a cash value account that earns a fixed rate of interest.
View the video 

Variable Group Universal Life (VGUL)
VGUL combines flexible life insurance with the option to invest in a variety of investment options and make allocations to a Guaranteed Account.
View the video 
For VGUL, the investment subaccounts offer a variety of potential risks and rates of return so that employees can individualize their investments to help meet personal financial objectives. Investments will fluctuate and when redeemed, may be worth more or less than originally invested. Plans may be designed to include a Guaranteed Account that offers a fixed rate of return guaranteed to never fall below three percent. The guarantees for the Guaranteed Account are based solely on the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Minnesota Life, which are important; however, they do not have any bearing on the performance of the investment options.

Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D)
AD&D coverage provides a benefit if an insured's death or dismemberment is due to a covered accident, whether it occurs at work or elsewhere.

Business Travel Accident (BTA) 
Business Travel Accident insurance provides a lump-sum benefit if an insured's death or dismemberment is due to a covered accident, while on the business of the employer.

Critical Illness
If an insured is diagnosed with a covered condition in the policy, and meets all policy requirements, Critical Illness insurance provides a lump-sum benefit that can be used any way the insured chooses to cover expenses such as child care, mortgage payments or out-of-pocket medical costs.
View the video 

Accident Insurance
Accidents can happen to anyone. If the insured experiences an accidental injury covered in the policy, they can get a payout to use any way they wish to cover deductibles, out-of-pocket medical costs or everyday living expenses.
View the video 

Hospital Indemnity
Hospitalization is a lot more common than people may realize. And when it happens, it can be costly. Hospital Indemnity insurance provides a predetermined benefit amount while the insured is in the hospital. Benefit amounts are not dependent upon the hospital charges and are paid in addition to any other benefits the insured may receive. Hospital Indemnity insurance benefits can be used to help pay out of pocket and non-covered expenses, as well as help with additional cost of living expenses.
View the video 
VGUL is distributed through Securian Financial Services, Inc., Member FINRA/SIPC. 400 Robert Street North, St. Paul, MN 55101, 1-888-237-1838.
 
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a portfolio and the variable insurance product carefully before investing. The portfolio and variable insurance product prospectuses contain this and other information. You may obtain a copy of the prospectus from your representative. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
The guarantees for the Guaranteed Account are based on the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Minnesota Life, which are important; however, they do not have any bearing on the performance of the variable subaccount. Investments in the variable subaccounts will fluctuate and the cash value available for loans, withdrawals or redemption may be worth more or less than when originally invested. Since it is primarily an insurance product, VGUL does contain fees and expenses such as management fees, fund expenses, distribution fees and mortality expense charges. The variable investment options are subject to market risk, including loss of principal.
Critical Illness Insurance - This policy provides limited benefits. This policy has exclusions, limitations, reduction of benefits, terms under which the policy may be continued in force or discontinued.

Minnesota Life's New Adjustable Life Policy: High Death Benefit, Low Premium | Business Wire
























































Minnesota Life's New Adjustable Life Policy: High Death Benefit, Low Premium






April 12, 2004 11:42 AM Eastern Daylight Time



				ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 12, 2004--Minnesota Life Insurance Company offers a new adjustable life policy, VAL Summit, designed to provide a high death benefit for a relatively low premium. The product was developed to compete with death benefit-focused variable policies.  "VAL Summit will be ideal for clients who want to provide strong death benefit protection for their loved ones yet still have the opportunity to have their cash values working for them in equity and fixed income subaccounts," said Bob Ehren, second vice president and actuary, Individual Financial Security. VAL Summit is based on the 2001 Commissioners Standard Ordinary (CSO) mortality tables that reflect the fact that Americans are living longer. 

 VAL Summit uses the similar underwriting categories available in its living benefit-focused sister policy, VAL Horizon, and also its first cousin, Adjustable Life (AL) Summit, a fixed life product with strong guarantees that was released last spring. All of the policies are based on the Adjustable Concept(TM), a comprehensive and updateable guarantee defined by three basic elements: a guaranteed plan of insurance, a face amount, and premium. The client chooses two of the three elements, with the value of the third variable determined by the first two.  "We benchmarked a variety of variable products in the industry and designed VAL Summit to offer one of the strongest death benefits in the variable life marketplace," said Ehren. "Our adjustable policies, combined with the Advantage 10- and 20-year term products, provide our individual customers with a full array of competitive insurance coverages."  VAL Summit was ordered effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) March 12, 2004.  Minnesota Life Insurance Company was founded in 1880 and provides financial security for individuals and businesses in the form of insurance, retirement plans and investments. Minnesota Life serves over seven million people with more than $390 billion of life insurance in force and nearly $22 billion in assets under management. Its combined work force of 4,400 employees and representatives is located in agencies and offices across the country and its St. Paul headquarters. The company is highly rated by the major independent rating agencies that analyze the financial soundness and claims-paying ability of insurance companies.  The financial strength and claims-paying ability of Minnesota Life are important but have no bearing on investment option performance. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of a portfolio and the variable insurance product carefully before investing. The portfolio and variable insurance product prospectuses, which are available from your representative, contain this information. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing.  Minnesota Life's variable insurance products are distributed through Securian Financial Services, Inc., member NASD/SIPC, 400 Robert St. N., St. Paul MN 55101, 888-237-1838.
