Picking the right person to care for your child is tough. So is picking the ingredients that go into baby products.










 



Safety in our Products
To ensure you have peace of mind when using JOHNSON’S® products, we have spent the last two years reformulating our products. We’re proud to release improved formulas, which are phthalate and paraben free. We’ve excluded thousands of ingredients over the years based on new science and based on what you’ve told us is important to you.

Safety in our ingredients
There is a lot of information out there about talc, not all of it true, so we wanted to share some basic facts to keep you well informed.


Talc comes from rock deposits found all over the planet and is mined like many other valuable minerals, but only the highest-grade talc, meeting our purity specifications, is used for talcum powder


It is hypoallergenic, helps eliminate friction and is clinically proven to be gentle and mild for your baby’s skin.


Science, research, clinical evidence and 30 years of studies by medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of cosmetic talc.

Choosing to Formula-Feed
 



      Share:    

 






There are many reasons a mother may decide formula feeding is the best option for providing her child with the basic nutrition requirements needed for proper growth and development. Here are some helpful tips to use when choosing formula for your baby.
 
Nine out of ten mothers use formula.
According to a recent study, most new mothers (9 out of 10, actually) use formula at some point during their baby's first year. So you're not alone, not by a long shot.
Women are choosing formula feeding for many reasons.
Either mom or baby has physical or medical issues.
She can't pump or breastfeed after returning to work.
She wants Dad and other family members to be a part of feeding.
There are many formula options for your baby.
You can feel good knowing that there are some excellent formula options out there. Look for the ones that are specially formulated to nourish your baby's brain and eye development and immune health.
What to look for in an infant formula:
Different brands of formulas have different levels of DHA, ARA and choline, key nutrients found in breast milk. Look for a formula with expert-recommended levels of these important building blocks for your baby's brain and eyes.
Most babies thrive on a formula with whole proteins. Breast milk has whole proteins in it, and you want your formula to be as close to breast milk as possible.
Your formula should satisfy your baby's basic nutrition requirements and provide the balanced nutrition your baby needs, including calcium and antioxidants.
Smart Formula Nutrition

*Average level of DHA in worldwide breast milk is 0.32% +/- 0.22% (mean +/- standard deviation of total fatty acids) based on an analysis of 65 studies of 2,474 women.
†As calculated from the mean choline content of human milk determined by the Institute of Medicine.

What's fat got to do with my toddler's brain development?






Believe it or not, your toddler's brain is more than 60% fat. The polyunsaturated fats from the foods he eats can provide his body with fatty acids like DHA and ARA, which are building blocks of his brain.







  

 


What are prebiotics? How do they benefit my toddler?






Prebiotics are a type of carbohydrate that helps promote gastrointestinal health. They can stimulate the growth and/or activity of good bacteria in the digestive system, helping to support your toddler's digestive health. All Enfagrow® products have our Natural Defense® Dual Prebiotic® blend that promotes soft stools and is designed to help support digestive health.







  

 


How can I help with my baby's fussiness and gas?






Fussiness and/or excess gas can be caused by something you ate if you're nursing, or by a sensitivity to lactose in your baby's formula. Try these tips to prevent baby fussiness and gas.If you're breastfeeding, lay off the spicy or gassy foods like cabbage, garlic, onions, broccoli and caffeine.If you're formula-feeding, ask your doctor about formulas with partially broken-down proteins and reduced lactose that can help with fussiness or relieve gassy baby.

How do I know if I should use powder or liquid formula for my baby?






Many of our products are available in different forms to fit individual needs and preferences and most infants and toddlers can use the product forms interchangeably. When prepared according to label directions, all forms (powder or liquid) of the same product will provide the same nutrition to meet a child’s needs. We offer our ready-to-use liquid formulas in convenient sizes. Our 2 fluid ounce Nursette® bottles are wonderful for late night feedings, while several of our formulas come in re-sealable 8 fluid ounce Ready-to-Use plastic bottles which are terrific for when running errands or traveling.

What do babies need iron for?






Iron is an important nutrient, no matter how old you are. Iron is an essential part of hemoglobin, which is the primary transporter of oxygen in the red blood cell. Iron is important for psychomotor and mental development in infants and children.

How are premature babies' nutritional needs different? 






Since premature babies missed some weeks of building up important nutrients, they are usually born with low birth weight and reduced levels of some nutrients. After they are born, these babies need to make up for that lost time. While in the hospital, they also tend to have more digestive problems than full-term babies, and often need to eat more frequently. Usually, doctors will recommend a commercially prepared breast milk fortifier to give your baby the extra protein, vitamins, calcium and other nutrients she needs at this early stage. 
If you can't pump or breastfeed, or choose not to, you can feel confident about the specially designed formulas available for infants born prematurely that provide the appropriate amount of these vital nutrients.

Does my baby need vitamin supplements?






Babies generally get all the nutrition they need with formula.
If your baby is breastfed, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving her a vitamin D supplement, as breast milk typically has very low levels of this nutrient. What's more, infants don't get sun exposure like adults do, to produce vitamin D naturally.
Your breastfed baby may also need an iron supplement, if your baby is born premature, or with low birth weight, or has low iron stores at birth.
As your baby becomes a toddler (and a picky eater), you may want to ask your doctor about vitamin supplements to be sure she's getting all the nutrition she needs.
