This compares to Adjusted EBITDA of $21.1 million, Retail Gross Margin of $39.6 million, and Net Income of $15.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, representing changes of 62%, 63%, and (28)%, respectively.“Spark has continued to build on our successes in 2016 with our strongest first quarter in the company's history,” said Nathan Kroeker, Spark Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Once again, we have delivered record Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin and reached another high-water mark with 789,000 RCEs. In April we closed on the acquisition of Perigee Energy and exercised an option for additional customers that combined will add another 60,000 RCEs. This transaction establishes our presence in Delaware, bringing our totals to 91 utilities in 19 states.“We are also pleased to announce today the pending acquisition of Verde Energy. We expect this acquisition to add approximately $25 million of annual Adjusted EBITDA after synergies and will add approximately 145,000 RCEs to our portfolio, bringing our total RCE count to nearly 1,000,000 RCEs. Verde provides us with a 100% renewable energy brand and additional capabilities with an established presence in 40 utility service territories across eight states. Verde is expected to close in the second half of 2017.“As we complete the onboarding process for the customers acquired in the Perigee Energy transactions and prepare to close on and integrate Verde, we continue to anticipate growth through organic means and additional M&A opportunities throughout the rest of the year.”2017 Financial GuidanceSpark is maintaining 2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $110.0 to $120.0 million, which includes the recent Perigee Energy transactions but excludes the pending Verde acquisition.Strategic UpdateAs discussed above, Spark announced today that it has entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the acquisition of Verde, which operates in eight states selling 100% renewable electricity and natural gas products under the "Verde" brand. Spark will pay cash of $45 million at closing and installment payments totaling $20 million over 18 months. There is an additional earnout that is subject to Verde's ability to achieve defined performance metrics. The Company expects to close the Verde acquisition in the second half of 2017 utilizing a combination of cash on hand along with additional borrowings under Spark's credit facilities. This transaction is subject to lender consent and customary regulatory approvals.Summary First Quarter 2017 Financial Results For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, Spark reported Adjusted EBITDA of $34.2 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $21.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. This increase of $13.1 million is primarily attributable to increased Retail Gross Margin in the Company's electricity and natural gas segments, partially offset by increased spending on customer acquisitions and increased general and administrative expenses due to Spark's increased RCE count.For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, Spark reported Retail Gross Margin of $64.3 million compared to Retail Gross Margin of $39.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. This increase of $24.7 million is primarily attributable to the increased volumes of retail electricity and natural gas following the acquisitions of Major and Provider.Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $11.4 million compared to net income of $15.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, due primarily to non-cash losses on Spark's hedge portfolio of $14.0 million in the quarter.Liquidity and Capital Resources ($ in thousands) March 31, 2017   Cash and cash equivalents $ 24,931     Senior Credit Facility Working Capital Line Availability 43,172     Senior Credit Facility Acquisition Line Availability 2,763     Subordinated Debt Availability 25,000     Total Liquidity $ 95,866   Conference Call and WebcastSpark will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2017 results on Monday, May 8, 2017 at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern).Read MoreA live webcast of the conference call can be accessed from the Events & Presentations page of the Spark Energy Investor Relations website at http://ir.sparkenergy.com/events.cfm.

EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before provision for income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. We deduct all current period customer acquisition costs (representing spending for organic customer acquisitions) in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred, even though we capitalize such costs and amortize them over two years in accordance with our accounting policies. The deduction of current period customer acquisition costs is consistent with how we manage our business, but the comparability of Adjusted EBITDA between periods may be affected by varying levels of customer acquisition costs. For example, our Adjusted EBITDA is lower in years of customer growth reflecting larger customer acquisition spending. We do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of business or portfolios of customers in calculated Adjusted EBITDA. We deduct our net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, excluding current period cash settlements, from the Adjusted EBITDA calculation in order to remove the non-cash impact of net gains and losses on derivative instruments. We also deduct non-cash compensation expense as a result of restricted stock units that are issued under our long-term incentive plan.We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors as a financial indicator of our ability to incur and service debt, pay dividends and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our condensed consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, commercial banks and rating agencies, use to assess the following:our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends; andour ability to fund capital expenditures (including customer acquisition costs) and incur and service debt.Reconciliation of Spark’s estimate of Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 to the relevant GAAP line items is not being provided as Spark is not providing 2017 guidance for net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities, or the reconciling items between these GAAP financial measures and Adjusted EBITDA. Spark does not provide guidance for such items because it is not possible to forecast the future non-cash impacts of net gains and losses on derivative instruments and non-cash compensation expense attributable to grants of equity under our Long Term Incentive Plan. Additionally, it is not possible to forecast our provision for income taxes due to the potential for change in our non-controlling interests’ ownership percentage, given the nature of our Up-C structure. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities is not available without unreasonable effort.Retail Gross MarginWe define retail gross margin as operating income (loss) plus (i) depreciation and amortization expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses, less (i) net asset optimization revenues, (ii) net gains (losses) on non-trading derivative instruments, and (iii) net current period cash settlements on non-trading derivative instruments. Retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity business by removing the impacts of our asset optimization activities and net non-cash income (loss) impact of our economic hedging activities. As an indicator of our retail energy business’ operating performance, retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.We believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business's operating performance.The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Retail Gross Margin is operating income (loss). Our non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities, or operating income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or Retail Gross Margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and are defined differently by different companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.Management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management’s decision-making process.The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities for each of the periods indicated.
