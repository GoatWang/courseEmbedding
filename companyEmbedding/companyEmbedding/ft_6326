Geist 6326 Flood Sensor 15 ft

 Knows when water invades your equipment or server room. Used to detect water leaks Connects to the Geist Climate Monitor via Analog Input or Analog to Digital Converter Receive alarms via email or SNMP The flood sensor allows the Geist Climate Monitor to detect leaks that could damage your equipment. The sensor measures conductivity and indicates whether the sensor is dry, damp, or completely immersed in water.When water or other conductive liquid is present, a tiny electrical current flows between the metal contacts on the sensor. The more liquid, the higher the current. A cable attached to the sensor allows the climate monitor to detect the presence and severity of a leak. Some example sources include: Plumbing fixtures Air-conditioner drip pans Condensation-outflow pans Roof/ceiling leaks

Quality. Trust.The best companies put a lot of effort into building and maintaining their brand image. They're attentive to customers' wants and needs, stay current with the latest technology, and of course offer the best products backed up with industry leading customer service and warranties. When you shop for brand names you can buy with the confidence that comes from knowing that you're getting a product with a proven reputation for quality, reliability and performance. We're consumers just like you and brand names are just as important to us. That's why we carry only the top brands in the automotive aftermarket. Check out the extensive list of brands we offer and you'll see names that you know and trust, because we wouldn't sell you anything we wouldn't put on our own vehicles.Our wide range of brands means you'll always be able to get exactly what you need no matter what you're doing to your vehicle or what you're driving. Want a spoiler for your Civic? Choose from 7 different brands, each offering a selection of styles and materials. Need brakes for your Chevy pickup? There are 14 brands to choose from at prices and friction compounds to suit your wallet and driving style. How about a performance exhaust system for your Mustang? We offer 8 different brands so you can get the performance and sound you want in your choice of material and price. These are just a few examples of the tremendous variety you'll find on our digital shelves. When you shop here you'll never have to settle for a color or style you don't really want because "that's all they had".Some retailers buy end lots, closeouts, and fakes and pose as approved dealers, only to leave you in the lurch when there's a problem. You'll never be in that predicament with us because we are authorized dealers for most of the brands we sell and we have ongoing business relationships with those companies. This benefits you because when you shop with us you can be assured that you're getting the genuine article, not some cheap knock-off, and you'll have all the support the company offers including a valid warranty in the unlikely event you have a problem with your purchase. Our status as authorized dealer also allows us to offer sales and promotions sanctioned by the manufacturer, including discounted prices, manufacturers' rebates, and product giveaways.Featured VideosForgiato Difalco Grille01Curt02Kenwood Car Entertainment Systems03Rigid Industries Tortured04Backrack05We don't just sell auto parts and accessories, we're enthusiasts like you and we use the products we carry on our own vehicles. Our staff's automotive interests are as varied as our brands, and they're into everything including lifted 4-wheelers, tuner cars, muscle cars, drag racing, and autocross. We install the brand name products we sell and test them on our own cars and trucks. The employee parking area looks like a product testing lab with plenty of wheel and tire combos, body kits, spoilers, and custom grilles, slammed sports models and sky high 4-wheelers. Under those hoods there's cold air intakes, turbochargers, and performance tunes, and when they're fired up you'll hear the throaty rumble from free-flowing exhaust systems. If we find that a product doesn't measure up to our standards, we won't sell it. When you buy from us you get the best purchasing experience possible because of the familiarity and experience we have with our brands.

                            Geist Flood Sensor 15 ft
                        

Knows when water invades your equipment or server room.  Used to detect water leaks Connects to the Geist Climate Monitor via Analog Input or Analog to Digital Converter Receive alarms via email or SNMP  The flood sensor allows the Geist Climate Monitor to detect leaks that could damage your equipment. The sensor measures conductivity and indicates whether the sensor is dry, damp, or completely immersed in water.When water or other conductive liquid is present, a tiny electrical current flows between the metal contacts on the sensor. The more liquid, the higher the current. A cable attached to the sensor allows the climate monitor to detect the presence and severity of a leak. Some example sources include:  Plumbing fixtures Air-conditioner drip pans Condensation-outflow pans Roof/ceiling leaks

                    The Apollo Beach community is a vibrant and rapidly growing part of the Southshore area. There is a phenominal local brewery (Four Stacks), a great CrossFit gym (Apoge CrossFit) and just down the street is some amazing pizza (East Coast Pizza) on Big Bend Road. I am very excited to call the area home and look forward to all the new neighbors to come because the new construction (and existing) home markets are BOOMING!
