 Make the Jump and Switch to BEAM.
IT’S EASY!
Whether your current solution uses “Point-to-Point” or shares images via the Cloud, the BEAM solution will cover your needs.
Want to Learn More?Watch How BEAM Helps You Succeed
 Different Customers Have Different Medical Image Sharing NeedsManaging medical image exchange and sharing is a challenge that impacts everyone in a healthcare organization.  Providers, patients, administrators, department directors and staff all have different workflow needs and priorities with medical imaging exchange.  Our recent BEAM survey demonstrates just how many needs our clients have!  That’s why our customers love not just the flexibility of BEAM’s Image Exchange Suite but also its extensibility.
 Image Sharing 80 CD Imaging Workflow Challenges 75 Mobile Image Viewing 43 EHR, PACS, VNA Integration 40 Patient Engagement 32 XDS-i Enablement 10      Proven Medical Image Exchange Solutions Improve Quality of Care
Providers were most pleasantly surprised by how easily images can be exchanged. A OneMedNet provider said: ‘Our reading physicians in the lab were very pleased with the speed the system enabled. Most of the transfers we do involve obtaining comparative studies from other entities. Getting those studies from other entities became much faster once we got the system. There have been a number of incidences when we have discovered that we needed a study for comparison within 30 or 40 minutes at 5:30 on a Friday evening, when everyone is going home. It would just be inconceivable to get the study via any other method. The most positive effect the system has had is with speeding up our reporting capabilities and improving our ability to receive comparisons with very short notice.’KLAS Research, Image Exchange 2014Providers were happy with how easy the setup process was as well as how easy it was to ingest CDs. The extent to which organizations saved money was also an unexpected outcome of implementing image exchange. One provider explained, ‘OneMedNet BEAM reduces the number of FTEs we need. There has been a huge reduction in follow-up and costs. We used to have to pay FTEs $16–$20 an hour, and now we are saving that money and getting images within minutes instead of almost half an hour. The system has resulted in huge cost savings for us.’KLAS Research, Image Exchange 2014Are You Ready to Start Sharing Medical Images?

Image Sharing with Confidence

FLEXIBLE

SECURE

EFFICIENT
Flexibility Appreciated by All
Providers can leverage the speed and simplicity of BEAM Point-to-Point (P2P) technology for high volume situations.  While the same provider can also utilize BEAM Cloud technology for less frequent image sharing needs.  Both providers and patients benefit from BEAM’s flexible and uncompromising design!

MOBILE ENABLED VIEWING

View medical images, reports & other patient data from any location
Server-side rendering leaves no PHI on mobile devices
Zero Footprint Viewer provides clinicians with measurement, historical timelines, hanging protocols and other tools

Patient Access to Medical Data Helps Patients
Research shows that when patients are provided with access to their medical records, they become more engaged in their treatment and experience better care outcomes.

Empower patient care by providing access to medical images & reports
Enable patients to take medical images anywhere with BEAM’s Cloud
Image enable existing patient portals with BEAM’s API
Reduce wasted staff time and cost related to burning patient files
Create patient affinity in competitive markets


Unmatched Security for Peace of Mind
BEAM offers industry-leading data security for both today and tomorrow.
Same Convenience,
More Secure
Our Medical Image Exchange solution was
designed with security as priority #1
When a patient’s confidential records are shared or uploaded to our BEAM’s Cloud, they are only available for a convenient window of time before being purged from the OneMedNet servers. If the patient images are ever needed after being purged, a cloud user can easily request the image producer to re-send the study.
BEAM’s Cloud design allows convenient access to sensitive data for physicians and patients without creating the security risk of permanent data duplication in a 3rd party location.
Full Data
Federation
VPN quality security with
consent management
The BEAM Medical Image Exchange architecture allows customers to eliminate VPN overhead and maintain full control of imaging data, yet still enable full-fidelity image transfers between organizations. Image sharing workflows empower organizations to authorize, request, and track image transfers – an image is never sent to a remote location unless it has been approved by both the sender and receiver.
Once image sharing is authorized, the exchange between organizations is graceful. Our distributed network automatically resume transfers if an interruption, such as network failure, ever occurs. All transfers are checked for integrity upon completion to ensure the full-fidelity DICOM studies are ready for viewing.
Multiple
Security Layers
256-bit AES encrypted payloads over SSL
BEAM implements security principles outlined in the NIST Security Framework for Healthcare. Security features include:
256-bit AES payload encryption for transfers
Temporal SSL connections that leverage dynamic keys
SSL Key Entropy
IP range restrictions
LDAP and Active Directory Integration
Auto-logout
Dual party authorization for PHI transfer initiation
Efficiency in Design and Operation
Whether requesting or transferring an image, the process must be straightforward and streamlined on both ends. Also, the solution must be extremely robust and eliminate potential downtime. Importantly, BEAM is not reliant on poorly performing VPNs.
Images can be sent (and received) in seconds, no matter the location or the device. Whereas some products offer time savings with CD import, BEAM actually delivers significant and measurable workflow time savings.

Fast Deployments
BEAM Image Exchange is a light-weight solution, designed for quick implementations. Image sharing doesn’t need to be complicated.

No Java or ActiveX
BEAM never requires 3rd party plug-ins such as Java, Flash, or ActiveX. Our Image Exchange product runs in any web browser, that includes Apple, Android and Microsoft mobile devices and tablets!

Enterprise Ready
BEAM is already integrated with a growing number of 3rd party products. Add BEAM’s RESTful API for custom workflows, our LDAP, Active Directory, DICOM, DICOM Worklist, and HL7 connectors, and you have a powerful image exchange solution for your hospitals, clinics and imaging centers.
Reduce Costs with BEAM CD Import

Import medical images from any enterprise computer – No PACS workstations needed
BEAM’s Cloud enables patients & providers to import CD images from anywhere
The BEAM API allows for launching custom CD import workflows from PACS, EHRs, portals and many other systems
Patient identity reconciliation tools
Accession management tools
BEAM supports role-based access
