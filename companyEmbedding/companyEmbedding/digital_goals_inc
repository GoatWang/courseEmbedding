Once you’ve got the goods, here’s how to take a page from its marketing playbook.
By Catherine Kaputa6 minute ReadWhether it’s launching its latest iPhone or iPad, Apple sure knows how to create buzz with consumers and the media (recent maps debacle aside). While other companies fight for attention, Apple seems to effortlessly dominate the media–not to mention the hearts and minds of customers–with its new product launches. Recently, Apple sold 2 million iPhone 5’s on day one, and then a couple of days later the stock hit the stratospheric price of $700 a share. So you could say they’re doing something right.advertisementIn researching hundreds of successful entrepreneurial companies for my new book, I was struck by strategies and tactics used by Apple to create media and consumer buzz that were not commonly employed by other brands.If you want to build buzz like Apple does–and maybe someday get your stock to their level–take note of these five marketing tactics: 
They cultivate an air of secrecy and intrigue to fuel speculation and buzz.
Many companies go to great lengths to preserve confidentiality during the product development phase, but Apple is a master of the teaser marketing campaign, dragging on the suspense for as long as possible. For weeks if not months before the release of every iPhone, the media conversation builds to deafening levels. Apple stokes the buzz by providing virtually no information. For example, Apple announced a press conference for September 12, 2012, but didn’t say what the press announcement was about. In essence, Apple created a cliffhanger as the media and bloggers speculated,”What could it be–the new iPhone 5 or something else?  All the bottom-up speculation in the media and blogosphere generated phenomenal consumer interest–for free. Only after weeks of free buzz did Apple launch a paid media campaign to keep the momentum going.The Takeaway:Start building relationships with the media and bloggers–the influencers who cover your industry. Nurture and expand them over time. Remember, the Internet is word of mouth on steroids. Marketers have always known that the best way to promote your product is to get others to do it for you. Nothing is more valuable than getting third-party experts to tout your brand. Take another page from Apple’s marketing book and launch a teaser campaign, a series of short, cryptic announcements that lead up to a larger, full-blown marketing campaign, and watch the interest and momentum build.They create the illusion of scarcity to increase demandLuxury goods marketers have long realized that scarcity (real or perceived) makes a product more desirable and in demand. Scarcity not only increases the value of a product, it propels the procrastinators and all us who want to be part of the trendy crowd to step up and buy. That’s why it is a favored tactic of designer handbag manufacturers and other luxury goods. Apple has found its own ways to hype the sense of faux scarcity. It did not have enough phones available when it went on sale. Just one hour after the iPhone 5 went on sale for preorders on September 14, 2012, the Apple website reported that heavy demand had necessitated delayed delivery. Adding to the illusion of scarcity was the fact that you could only preorder the phone, and lines were long. The tactic worked. Not only did the iPhone 5 set a record for first-day sales, even two weeks after the iPhone went on sale, it was on a back order of three to four weeks, prolonging the difficulty (and desirability) of owning one.advertisementThe Takeaway:Consider intentionally restricting production of a product to create scarcity and fuel demand for your product. Other tactics you can explore are making the offer only available for a limited time or until a certain number have been sold. Or you can report on your website or customer sales calls that only a small number of certain items are left in stock–but only if that’s really the case.They focus on a “friendly” customer experience.Apple products have always been designed to be different, delightful and friendly. I say “friendly” because the core driver of every Apple product is the removal of complexity in favor of ease of use with innovative features like touchscreen “gestures” for zooming and scrolling or SIRI, your personal assistant. Its history of innovative, “friendly” gadgets creates anticipation about what they will do next to advance the consumer experience. The new iPhone 5 ads capture its new friendly features in one phrase: “4-inch Retina display, ultrafast wireless, iOS 6, in a thinner, lighter design.”The Takeaway:Think outside-in as smart branders do. Begin with your customer first (outside), then figure out how your can improve your product or service to meet that customer need (inside). Ask yourself, “What would make your product easier to use for customers?” and “How can you make the customer experience special and different–at every touch point?” Think of the customer experience holistically. Don’t stop with the product design, but look at the way it’s sold and displayed in the store or on your website, as well as the customer service experience with your call center. Make sure that the customer benefits your product offers are crisp and clear in all your marketing–like the iPhone tagline above.They wow customers through design and packagingNot only does Apple have a history of product innovations, they package their products brilliantly. Steve Jobs famously looked outside the tech world for design and packaging inspiration, at Japanese packaging design, Italian car finishes, and the like. He was one of the first technology leaders to realize that beautiful design can be an important product differentiator. Apple’s brand architecture is monolithic. Every touch point conveys a modern, minimalistic brand image from the product design itself to its packaging to the Apple store where you can buy it. Go into an Apple store and you’ll find the same design aesthetic and brand personality as you’ll find in the gadget in your hand. Many customers are so wowed by Apple’s beautiful,”open me first” packaging that they don’t throw it away, which is called “unboxing.”advertisementThe Takeaway:Make sure every touch point where customers come into contact with your company and its products conveys your company’s brand personality with a unified visual identity, a distinct look and feel that sets you apart from others. Find a visual hook, a visual something, a design, a color, a logo or a shape that your brand can own in the minds of customers. Aim to have a visual identity that is instantly recognizable like Apple’s.They create a passionate brand community of fans who identity with Apple’s brand valuesWhile other tech manufacturers see their products as utilitarian, geeky and inexpensive, Apple is the opposite: cool, friendly, and upmarket. Apple has created a brand culture that has attracted a passionate brand community of followers who identify with the brand’s innovativeness, simplicity, and coolness. They are fans who lock into the entire family of Apple products and must have the latest gadget right when it comes out, even if it means waiting in line for hours. It’s quite a phenomenon to behold.The Takeaway:Write down your brand values that define your brand culture. Remember Apple’s “Think Different” ad campaign that defined Apple’s brand values and brand culture? Here were the opening lines: “Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in square holes…” Once you have defined what your brand stands for, then zero in on the types of consumers who share those values, and create digital communities through social media, blogs, or in-person meet-ups so that it’s easy for your brand’s fans to connect to your company and each other.If you want to get your products noticed, maybe it’s time for you to start breaking the rules as Apple does.advertisementCatherine Kaputa is a brand consultant and author of Breakthrough Branding and You Are A Brand!, now in its second edition.

User Testimonials















Pinda Bazley
Site Analytics Lead, Microsoft 
One thing that was attractive to me is that we had office hours where we could ask questions, have discussions, and get advice from Bryan. I was surprised how organized the curriculum was and how much knowledge he was willing to share with us.
The video for the class was amazing. Once you watch the video you get it right away. In Market Motive everyone is the best in the industry. If you want to learn from the best, Market Motive is a great place for you. Once you get in, it's amazing. I think it was worth the money.













Landin Gee 
Online Marketing Manager, Entrepreneur Magazine 
In order to be the best in your field, you have to continue learning, and what's better than learning from the best. With Entrepreneur Magazine, learning analytics has helped us do things more efficiently, and it improved our marketing efforts. Learning analytics from Avinash and John helped me broaden my perspective on things and create better workflows, as well as better targets to help accomplish the goals for my company.
The thing that helped me the most was when we had our weekly sessions. It gave me more insight to improve. After you do your homework and they evaluate it, they give you some great feedback on refining your goals. If you're serious about your craft or specialty, it should be a no-brainer.













Lisa Kowitt
Marketing Specialist, Duke Energy 
I almost don't want this to end. It's been so mind-expanding and good for my skill set. What will I do next? The time flies by because it's so intensely interesting and engaging. It really has a classroom feel, which is surprising to me. I feel like I'm part of the student body. We have office hours where students interact with the faculty and ask questions, and we've gotten to know each other through that. There's also workshops where we're all together. You can ask questions and hear the responses, so I was really surprised at the community feeling of this class.












Gary Brown
Internet Marketing Specialist, Factory Image
The courses are comprehensive and all-encompassing. It's the best money I've spent in ten years of chasing education online. The difference is increased revenue for my company, to be quite honest with you. Especially in SEO.
We're now able to not only list per keyword phrase on the front page of Google, but also in some cases we own the whole front page for the keyword phrase. That's a direct relationship to a couple of tidbits that were picked up in the SEO class.












Dagmar Gatell
Chief Strategist & Co-Founder, Sozial Monster
You can spend thousands and thousands to get a diploma from a university, but I didn't hear very good things about that. It's not only basic information, but also it's not really proven. We were looking for a group of experts that could provide us with real-life experience and make it easy for us to be successful.
What's interesting with Market Motive is you feel like they're your mentors. They really want you to be successful. Most surprising to me was how easy it was to study the materials and use them in my daily business life. I really loved how everything was explained and written in such an easy way but was still highly professional.

A guide to setting high-level goals to keep your marketing on track
The range of marketing channels available today and the rate at which they change drives to us to work longer, harder and more efficiently...  it can often feel like you are ice skating uphill.
The challenge can seem even harder if realistic goals aren't set to base your plans around.  The lack of goals and just a constant, never-ending journey of 'change' can mean that we miss out on the rewards of achievement. My time spent as part of growing a marketing agency with smaller and larger multi billion dollar companies has taught me that both benefit businesses and staff benefit from moving to clearer goals.
Goals are different to objectives and KPIs
Even in my relatively short time in marketing (9 years), I have seen the rise of data, analytics, information and I for one value its power within organisations. That being said all this analysis, tools, insights are also one of the root causes to ineffective marketing and a lack of creativity.
I believe digital marketing teams have become too data orientated, they lack vision, creativity and confidence, goals are a way to solve this while keeping elements of measurement.
Goals are not commercial metrics or objectives, neither should they be about marketing performance indicators. 
So, goals are a higher-level tool to help understand if you are on track or not and are important for different reasons to specific objectives. Without goals you don't have context for performance. In our Delivering Results from Digital Marketing Guide we give examples of broader vision and goals against more specific objectives.
Vision > Goals > Objectives > KPIs > Measures

To help remember the difference between these, just add your own prefixes:
Long-term Vision > Broad organisational goals > Specific SMART objectives > Performance driving KPIs

Examples of useful top-level goals

Create the most remarkable customer service in our industry
To be the most visible brand in our niche
To make every one of our consumers want to talk about us
To create the most remarkable brand experience known in our category
Increase our site traffic while reducing overall media spend

Each of the above would allow you to rule out a lot of distractions, choices and channels. Imagine the power of that in your business. People can say 'No' without the fear. Let's face it, in 2013 it is easy to be busy doing lots of stuff, and work hard doing it, but without goals and focus its impact can be negligible, no matter your position in a company. Equally they can all be measured with 3-5 simple metrics.
Success and Goals
The definition of success: 'If you are working towards a pre-determined goal and know where you are going you are a success'. Earl Nightgale wrote this in the 'the strangest secret' in the 1950's where he argues that with goals you will be successful and I think it is true today as it was then. So are you a success?
Goals…

Align teams - A team with a mission and a focus empowers them to work together rather than everyone pulling in different directions. It unites and creates a sense of purpose in an office environment.
They create Leaders not Followers. Your colleges, staff, partners all want to grow and develop and all leaders / management should want to be worked out of a job. Goals help people move forwards, it gives them clarity and also a sense of achievement which aids confidence and encourages personal growth.
Empower people to say no - Possibly the most important of all goals give people the ultimate focus. In a world where there is a million and one tactics, channels and ideas we 'could do'. Remove the any remote chance of procrastination and excuses for not performing / achieving.
Give a sense of success - It is important to celebrate at the right times, and when is that?! When you achieve something of course. In a world where the bar is forever moving higher we need to ensure at the right time we celebrate to. It helps confidence, moral and well just that feel good factor!
Operate at every level of businesses - Whether you are an CEO, Marketing Manager or SEM Executive goals have a role to play in your productivity, development and stress levels!
Move us from day-to-day tactics to strategic growth -

5 Steps to setting and using Goals
The process below isn't new, Zig Ziglar and Seth Godin's book on goals explains a similar approach as does using SMART goals.

Step One: Write down each goal and give target dates

First things first, write your goal down, give it a small description and set a date for completing it by. It can be 'within 12 months' as much as by 14th May 2014… Within digital marketing the 5S goals give a simple way to define a range of goals at a top level.

Step Two: List the obstacles

List the core obstacles and risks you have to overcome to help you / your team / your business to achieve the goal. Is it time, resource, budget, skills, knowledge, process?

Step Three: Understand the benefits and List Performance Indicators

Be clear on both the business benefits as well as the benefits to those in the business for achieving those goals. Being clear on the progress made is crucial to ensure you can set off on the right path. Considering the performance metrics you can monitor is also key at step 3. They should be things you can easily measure, make visible and are genuinely useful, i.e specific to the goal and your business.
If you are struggling to find which metrics are most important to you I recommend reading the Lean Analytics book, this will help you filter the right metrics.

Step Four: Identify what you need and apply a process

Outline the top-level steps you need to take and who can help you on the journey. Be clear on what process you need and how often you should check against your key metrics Making goals visible, daily, weekly & monthly is crucial, a physical presence is often best if you are office based, like a graphical display or similar.
The 90 day action plans I describe give a practical way to plan activity against goals. Other things can be as simple as weekly round ups to view 3-5 KPIs and top-level deliverables to understand progress towards goals.
Zig Ziglar and Seth Godin call the process "the drip". The small daily tasks in pursuit of a goal that create the compounded impact we all seek. There are no right or wrong rules when it comes to getting the work done, use whatever methods and tools you are most comfortable with.

Step Five: Reward or Walk Away

 If you hit your goals what is your reward? What is the teams reward? What is your customers reward? Your partners / agencies rewards? Equally, what is your walk away point, at what point do you think, this goal is not right, it's too high, it didn't anticipate X and Y happening. When do you know to start the process again?.
This is a common concept in negotiations, you should never enter negotiations with understanding your parameters for walking away, the same goes for goals, not every goal is achievable and that is no bad thing as long you learn.
Are you aimlessly chasing a mass of activities without the structure of goals? Why not try this process and see the improvements you can gain?
