  Rhode Island-based Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ Global Select; symbol: WASH), parent company of The Washington Trust Company, today held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010. Joseph J. MarcAurele, chairman, president, and chief executive officer, and David V. Devault, senior executive vice president, secretary, and chief financial officer, presided over the Meeting, which was attended by approximately 100 shareholders and guests at the newly renovated Westerly Public Library in Westerly, Rhode Island   Joseph J. MarcAurele, Washington Trust Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer (Photo: Business Wire)   The Corporation’s continued growth and profitability were recurring themes of the Meeting. Joseph J. MarcAurele, noted, “Our 2010 results were outstanding, as Washington Trust emerged as the “Bank of Choice” in Rhode Island for depositors, borrowers and investors. We achieved a record level of mortgage originations during the year; we moved into third place among Rhode Island-based banks for deposit market share; and earnings rose by 49 percent. Asset quality remained solid, our capital ratios remained strong, and we maintained a consistent dividend payment.”  David V. Devault reviewed the Corporation’s positive results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011, stating, “I am pleased to report that the first quarter of 2011 was characterized by a number of favorable trends. Earnings were up noticeably over the same quarter a year ago; we saw continued growth in loans, deposits and wealth management; as well as continued progress with asset quality, and our capital levels were further strengthened.”  In his closing remarks, MarcAurele noted, “Washington Trust’s continued success is contingent on the Corporation’s ability to take advantage of market opportunities to grow the organization.” He mentioned that Washington Trust successfully opened a mortgage production office in Burlington, Massachusetts in January of this year and has plans to open a retail branch office in East Providence, Rhode Island later this year .  “We have all of the tools we need to grow: a full line of financial products, the right technology, and a team of trusted advisors, professionals who are smart, friendly, and provide the personal service you won’t find anywhere else.”  Early in the program, special recognition was paid to  Edward M. Mazze, Ph.D., who retired from Washington Trust’s board effective with the Meeting. Mazze had been a Washington Trust director since 2000 and served on the Audit and the Compensation and Human Resources Committees. In acknowledging Dr. Mazze’s tenure and career achievements, MarcAurele stated, “Over the years, Ed’s extensive knowledge and experience in the fields of finance, marketing, and corporate governance have led to numerous contributions to our company. We look forward to reading your articles and hearing your economic forecasts in the news media.” Mazze will remain active in his role as a Distinguished University Professor of Business Administration at the University of Rhode Island, a position he has held since 2006.  He will also continue to serve as a consultant and on the boards of other local organizations.  During the business portion of the meeting, Gary P. Bennett, John J. Bowen, Robert A. DiMuccio, CPA, H. Douglas Randall, III, and John F. Treanor were elected to the Corporation’s Board of Directors for terms ending in 2014. Bowen, who officially joined Washington Trust’s board of directors subsequent with the Meeting, serves as Chancellor & Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island.  In other business, shareholders ratified the selection of KPMG, LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Corporation for the current fiscal year ending December 31, 2011. Shareholders also approved both the compensation of the Corporation’s named executive officers and the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes to approve the compensation of the Corporation’s named executive officers.

  Asset Quality   Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans, nonaccrual investment securities and property acquired through foreclosure or repossession) amounted to $23.0 million, or 0.79% of total assets, at December 31, 2010, essentially unchanged on a linked quarter basis and down from $30.5 million, or 1.06% of total assets, at December 31, 2009.  Nonaccrual loans totaled $18.5 million at December 31, 2010, down by $1.1 million in the fourth quarter and by $9.0 million from December 31, 2009. Property acquired through foreclosure or repossession amounted to $3.6 million at December 31, 2010, up by $1.0 million in the fourth quarter and up by $1.7 million from the balance at December 31, 2009.  At December 31, 2010, total past due loans amounted to $25.3 million, or 1.27% of total loans, up by $397 thousand in the fourth quarter and down by $6.3 million from December 31, 2009.  We believe that overall credit quality continues to be affected by weaknesses in national and regional economic conditions. These conditions, including relatively high unemployment levels, may continue for the next few quarters.  The loan loss provision charged to earnings amounted to $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, unchanged from the third quarter 2010 level and down by $500 thousand compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Net charge-offs amounted to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared to net charge-offs of $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The loan loss provision charged to earnings for 2010 totaled $6.0 million, down from $8.5 million in 2009. Net charge-offs amounted $4.8 million, or 0.24% of average loans, in 2010 and $4.8 million, or 0.25% of average loans, in 2009.  The allowance for loan losses was $28.6 million, or 1.43% of total loans, at December 31, 2010, compared to 1.40% of total loans at September 30, 2010 and 1.43% of total loans at December 31, 2009. Management will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in accordance with its established policies.
