ACTION:

Applicants:
USAA Mutual Funds Trust (the “Mutual Funds Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust that is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company with multiple series; USAA ETF Trust (the “ETF Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust that will be registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company with multiple series (together, the Mutual Funds Trust and the ETF Trust, the “Trusts,” and individually each a “Trust”); USAA Asset Management Company (“USAA AMC”), a Delaware corporation registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and USAA Investment Management Company, a Delaware corporation registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
Filing Dates:
The application was filed on August 18, 2016 and amended on January 27, 2017.
Hearing or Notification of Hearing:
An order granting the requested relief will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. on March 6, 2017 and should be accompanied by proof of service on the applicants, in the form of an affidavit, or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Pursuant to Rule 0-5 under the Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, any facts bearing upon the desirability of a hearing on the matter, the reason for the request, and the issues contested.

Addresses:
Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE., Washington, DC 20549-1090. Applicants: 9800 Fredericksburg Road, San Antonio, Texas 78288-0227.

Start Supplemental Information
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Summary of the Application
1. Applicants request an order to permit (a) a Fund [1] 
           (each a “Fund of Funds”) to acquire shares of Underlying Funds [2] 
           in excess of the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act and (b) the Underlying Funds that are registered open-end investment companies or series thereof, their principal underwriters and any broker or dealer registered under the Exchange Act to sell shares of the Underlying Fund to the Fund of Funds in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act.[3] 
           Applicants also request an order of exemption under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act from the prohibition on certain affiliated transactions in section 17(a) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Underlying Funds to sell their shares to, and redeem their shares from, the Funds of Funds.[4] 
           Applicants state that such transactions will be consistent with the policies of each Fund of Funds and each Underlying Fund and with the general purposes of the Act and will be based on the net asset values of the Underlying Funds.
2. Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application. Such terms and conditions are designed to, among other things, help prevent any potential (i) undue influence over an Underlying Fund that is not in the same “group of investment companies” as the Fund of Funds through control or voting power, or in connection with certain services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act.
3. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered Start Printed Page 10835investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

Assistant Secretary.

Footnotes

1.
     Applicants request that the order apply to each existing and future series of the Trusts and to each existing and future registered open-end investment company or series thereof that is advised by USAA AMC or its successors or by any other investment adviser controlling, controlled by, or under common control with USAA AMC or its successors and is part of the same “group of investment companies” as the Trusts (each, a “Fund”). For purposes of the requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity that results from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization. For purposes of the requested order, unless otherwise noted in the application, the term “group of investment companies” means any two or more investment companies, that are either registered investment companies, including closed-end investment companies, or business development companies, that hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and investor services.

        Back to Citation
      


2.
     Certain of the Funds and Underlying Funds have obtained or may obtain exemptions from the Commission necessary to permit their shares to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange at negotiated prices and, accordingly, to operate as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”).

        Back to Citation
      


3.
     Applicants represent that a Funds of Funds will not invest in reliance on the order in business development companies or closed-end investment companies that are not listed and traded on a national securities exchange.

        Back to Citation
      


4.
     A Fund of Funds generally would purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that operates as an ETF through secondary market transactions rather than through principal transactions with the Underlying Fund. Applicants nevertheless request relief from section 17(a) to permit a Fund of Funds to purchase or redeem shares from the ETF. A Fund of Funds will purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that is a closed-end fund through secondary market transactions at market prices rather than through principal transactions with the closed-end fund. Accordingly, applicants are not requesting section 17(a) relief with respect to transactions in shares of closed-end funds (including business development companies).

Second Quarter Update for USAA Managed Portfolio Shareholders


 
by 

USAA



‎07-05-2017
04:14 PM
 






By Bob Landry, CFA, Chief Investment Officer, USAA Investment Management Company
 
At the halfway mark of 2017, the dominant market themes are the same as when the year started – the Trump economic plan and the Federal Reserve’s decision-making. And just like back then, questions are plentiful nowadays and clear answers remain scarce.  An optimistic vision of economic growth under Trump lifted asset prices in the months following the November election. Investors rushed to position themselves for major tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and an infrastructure boom. Over the past eight months, some regulatory actions have been taken, but the rest is still in the promise phase.
 
Now the big question we and others are asking is “Which of the big targets is hittable, and when?” There’s been talk about taxes and infrastructure – if that talk starts to look like it could turn into action that lifts the economy, some of that post-election optimism could return.
 
The uncertainties have not affected the buoyancy of U.S. large caps so far in 2017 (Figure 1), though small-cap stocks that soared immediately after the election have come back to earth. International equities have fared better, while soft oil and metals prices have dragged down commodities.

 
FED DIRECTION: Signs of a weakening economy – first-quarter GDP growth came in at a paltry 1.2%,  and inflation is ebbing – have spurred questions about the Fed’s future direction.
 
Policymakers raised short-term interest rates in June; it was the fourth increase in the slow tightening cycle that began in December 2015. The Fed also announced it will gradually trim the $4 trillion-plus now held on its balance sheet.
 
Where do we go from here on rates? The Fed says it will hike again before year-end to head off any inflationary pressures during a period of near full employment. Based on current yields, however, the bond market appears unconvinced. The 10-year Treasury’s yield has tumbled from 2.6% to around 2.2% in the past few months as investors respond to softening economic data.
 
The Fed clearly wants to stay on pace with its slow tightening, but if mediocre data persists, a late 2017 rate increase may be delayed. The Fed has tended to play it safe during the long, grinding recovery that began in 2009. This scenario would support asset prices, and it would also fit our “low-ish for longer” outlook on rates.
 
GROWTH > VALUE: U.S. stocks continued their strong performance, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index further stretching already rich valuations in a low-volatility environment. Sharper-than-expected earnings growth contributed to the equity exuberance.
 
Growth-oriented sectors of the S&P are leading the way, as investors take on more risk in pursuit of decent returns in a slow economy. Technology, health care and consumer discretionary are at the top of the leader board. At the other end are energy, telecom and financials – value sectors that typically fare better when GDP growth is stronger.
 
Value turned in a strong 2016, but this year it has reverted to the weak-growth trend that has dominated the past decade. In our view, the lack of clarity on economic policy issues coming out of Washington is certainly contributing to value’s vast underperformance in 2017. That said, value sectors that serve as bond substitutes are mostly doing OK – these include utilities and consumer staples.
 

 
MOVING OVERSEAS: Equities in non-U.S. developed markets (DM), most notably the eurozone, and emerging markets (EM) are catching a tailwind generated by economic growth and improving corporate fundamentals.
 
Through the first six months of 2017, both DM and EM stocks were up by double digits, well ahead of the performance of the S&P 500. And because those asset classes have not enjoyed the same sort of multi-year returns as U.S. equities, their relative undervaluation compared to U.S. stocks (Figure 2) enhances their appeal.
 
Risks are down, but not completely gone. For DM, there are still open questions about bad debt at big European banks and we worry a bit that a volatility spike in U.S. stocks could be contagious. For EM, a revived U.S. dollar could hurt, as could changes to U.S. trade policy.
 
 The top contributors to the UMP portfolios in the second quarter were our exposure to non-U.S. developed markets and U.S. fixed income.
 
As we discussed above, the brightening trend for GDP growth (albeit from a low base) and corporate results, combined with attractive relative valuations, largely defines the opportunity we see in developed markets.
 
International stock rallies have been known to last for years, so once we were confident that underlying conditions could be sustainable, we swapped expensive assets for cheap ones by trimming our tactical allocation to U.S. large-cap stocks and adding to developed markets. Our exposure to value stocks was a headwind for U.S. large cap performance.
 
Our fixed-income tilt toward credit has been a major driver of UMP returns over the past year. Over that time, spreads to comparable Treasury bonds have tightened significantly – this suggests they may not be as meaningful going forward.
 
We believe, however, that corporate bond prices – particularly high yield -- may be resilient.
 
Higher revenue and earnings for U.S. companies stand to reduce default risks and rock-bottom Treasury yields continue to push income investors toward credit. In addition, lower inflation could stay the Fed’s hand on a second-half rate bump, but if the Fed opts to act, high yield’s low correlation to Treasuries make the asset class less sensitive to interest rate changes.
 
Our allocations to U.S. small cap stocks and alternatives were positive on an absolute basis in 2Q, but they underperformed stocks and thus detracted from our relative performance. It’s worth a reminder that alternatives were added to the UMP portfolios as diversifiers because of their low correlation to other asset classes – they would be expected to lag in a robust environment for equities.
 
 

 
 
As always, our advice to members is to remain focused on the long-term investment plan that you have put so much thought into. For those UMP shareholders who may be uneasy about market risk in general or have concerns about current asset-class allocations, we recommend consulting with a USAA advisor.
 
Investing in securities products involves risk, including possible loss of principal.
 
This material is provided for informational purposes only by USAA Asset Management Company (AMCO) and/or USAA Investment Management Company (IMCO), both registered investment advisors. The material is not investment advice and is not a recommendation, an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, strategy or investment product. The views and opinions expressed in the material solely reflect the judgment of the authors, but not necessarily those of AMCO, IMCO or any affiliates as of the date provided and are subject to change at any time. All information and data presented herein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable and is believed to be accurate as of the time presented, but AMCO/IMCO does not guarantee its accuracy.

No part of this material may be reproduced in any form, or referred to in any other publication, without express written permission of AMCO/IMCO and USAA.
 
Diversification is a technique to help reduce risk. There is no absolute guarantee that diversification will protect against a loss of income.
 
The fixed income securities are subject to price volatility and a number of risks, including interest rate risk. Interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions so that as interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall and vice versa. Interest rates are currently at historically low levels. Fixed income securities also carry other risks, such as inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks. Lower-quality fixed income securities involve greater risk of default or price changes. Securities of non-U.S. issuers generally involve greater risks than U.S. investments and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market and economic risks. Fixed income securities sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.

Investments in foreign securities are subject to additional and more diverse risks, including but not limited to currency fluctuations, market illiquidity, and political and economic instability. Foreign investing may result in more rapid and extreme changes in value than investments made exclusively in the securities of U.S. companies. There may be less publicly available information relating to foreign companies than those in the U.S. Foreign securities may also be subject to foreign taxes. Investments made in emerging market countries may be particularly volatile. Economies of emerging market countries are generally less diverse and mature than more developed countries and may have less stable political systems.

The MSCI Europe Index captures large- and mid-cap representation across 15 developed market countries in Europe. The index covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization across the European developed markets equity universe.
 
The S&P SmallCap 600 Index measures the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. The index is designed to track companies that meet specific inclusion criteria to ensure that they are liquid and financially viable.
