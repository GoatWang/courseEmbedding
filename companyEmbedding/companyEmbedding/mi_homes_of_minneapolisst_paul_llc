Leading Central Ohio Homebuilder
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own new home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with a 15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

A Safe & Secure Home
We want you to feel safe in your new home!  That’s why every new home in Columbus comes with a Schlage Keypad Lock .  You can control the locks on your home directly from your phone.  This safety device allows you to see what time the door is locked and unlocked using specific user codes. *Not included in Smart Series homes.
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Columbus and Central Ohio.  From the white fences of New Albany to the old world architecture of Dublin, our neighborhoods are a step above.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in: Blacklick,  Delaware, Gahanna, Galena, Grove City, Hilliard, Lewis Center, Licking Heights, Marysville, Olentangy, Pickerington, Powell, and Westerville.

Our Company
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Today, our commitment to our customers is evident in all of our new homes in Indianapolis. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
Industry Leading 15-Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry Leading 15-Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

Quality Construction
At M/I Homes, quality construction has always been a part of our backbone. This means we go above the industry standards to ensure our homes are well built. We use 2”x6” lumber to create stronger, more stable exterior walls.  This also allows for R19, a thicker insulation than the standard (R13).  We also build our homes' walls with the ZIP System®, a one-of-a-kind structural system with a built-in, energy efficient barrier that keeps the elements out while keeping you comfortable and helping you save on your energy bills!
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Indianapolis and Central Indiana. Whether it's neighboring the Carmel Arts District, Monon Trail, inches from Grand Park, or historic Cumberland Trail, we build where you want to live.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in leading school districts, Avon, Brownsburg, Carmel, Center Grove, Clark Pleasant, Franklin Township, Franklin, Hamilton Southeastern, Lawrence, Noblesville, Pike, Mt. Vernon, Washington, Westfield-Washington and Zionsville.

Leading New Homebuilder in Tampa
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Our new homes in Tampa are no exception.  M/I Homes in Tampa offers a wide variety of award winning floor plans to choose from whether you are a first-time home buyer or looking to move up to a new home. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own to fit your lifestyle in one of our beautiful communities and see for yourself why we are the new home leader.
Cleaner, Greener and More Cost Efficient Living
Every home we build is built to our stringent Whole Home guidelines. What does this mean to you? Not only do you get one of the most energy efficient homes on the market today, but we also care about the environment and use procedures to lessen the carbon footprint. Each home is tested and provided with a HERS score showing just how energy efficient your home is.
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry-Leading 15 Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.
Where We Build
We build new homes in premier locations across the Tampa Bay Area. You can find your perfect home in locations such as The Westchase area, Citrus Park, Odessa, Lutz, New Tampa, Lakeland, Land O'Lakes, and Riverview.

                    New Homes in Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN
                


You'll love the exciting, yet laid-back nature of the twin cities. It is only nine miles between the downtown areas Minneapolis and Saint Paul, but each city certainly has its own identity. Located in the heart of Minnesota, the Land of 10,000 Lakes, these beautiful cities are great places to raise a family, get an education, or enter the adult workforce. With something for everyone, it's no wonder that new construction is booming in and around the Twin Cities. Minneapolis is the bigger of the two cities. Named one of 7 "cool cities for young professionals," downtown Minneapolis is an exciting place with many great job opportunities. It also has a great art scene. The theater district is not to be missed; shows are put on every weekend by performance companies like Illusion, Bedlam Theater, and Brand New Workshop, to name just a few. Minneapolis is second to only New York City in terms of live theater performances per capita! To a get a big dose of the theater excitement, don't miss the Minnesota Fringe Festival, the largest non-juried theater festival in America. Walker Art Center is an amazing art facility for those more attracted to the still image. Its collection can't be beat. For a more interactive experience, be sure to head to the North Loop area which is full of galleries featuring the work of local artists. St. Paul, the state's capital, is the calmer and smaller twin. It was named the top cleanest metro area by Travel + Leisure magazine, making walking around this city much more enjoyable. Be sure to check out the renowned Science Museum of Minnesota, home to everything from a great dinosaur and fossil exhibit to an amazing IMAX theater to the strange and interesting Museum of Questionable Medical Devices. Popular music has been important to St. Paul and great historic clubs like the Turf Club and the Black Dog have been the meeting place of many important musicians like the Fantastic Merlins. The winter may be a cold one, but the residents of the twin cities don't let it stop them. The Saint Paul Winter Carnival is always fun with treasure hunts and ice sculpting competitions. Residents of the Twin Cities also love the outdoors. The wonderful Chain of Lakes trail connects several urban area lakes to each other with paths for biking, running, or walking along. Biking is very big in the twin cities, despite the cold temperatures. You'll find a vibrant bicycling culture and tons of bike paths, trails, and lanes so you can join in on the fun. With so many lakes in the area, summers will bring lots of outdoor swimming, fishing, and boating activities. Sports are also well loved. There is someone to cheer for year round between the NBA's Timberwolves, the MLB's Twins, the NFL's Vikings, and the NHL's Wild. Of course, we can't forget the Mall of America. The nation's biggest shopping mall has over 520 stores and an indoor theme park, Nickelodeon Universe. It's an adventure all its own! Come see what all the excitement is about. With tons of great companies headquartered in the area, like Gander Mountain, Target, and Ecolab, to name a few, and great family-friendly activities, the Twin Cities are a great place to call home.
