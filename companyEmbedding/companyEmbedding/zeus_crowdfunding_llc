 +–What is the difference between Zeus CrowdFunding and private money, hard money, or bridge money?

The term private money is typically associated with conservative non-traditional financing provided by a borrower’s family and friends. The term hard money is typically associated with high interest rate asset-based lenders. The term bridge money is typically associated with non-traditional temporary loans provided by banks. Zeus CrowdFunding is a unique alternative due to our very fast funding process, low interest rates and fees, our conservative risk-adverse standards, and participation by individual Z-Crowd investors in our program. 


 +–Do you need perfect credit for Zeus CrowdFunding?

Yes and no. Our clients have an average score above 700. Credit scores and credit history are great tools for assessing the likelihood of repayment, but unlike a traditional bank, we consider the following additional factors that may offset less than perfect credit:

1. What is the overall quality (location and LTV) of the property in question?
2. Will the borrower be pledging any other real estate as collateral or protection?
3. How much liquid cash does the borrower have?
4. How much money is the borrower going to contribute to the transaction?

We consider these factors before making a final determination for any borrower, regardless of credit score and credit history. We do not finance solely against the property or solely against the borrower, and we take an overall common sense approach to both. 


 +–Why are you able to fund these projects when a bank or hard/private money lender cannot or will not?

Most banks and hard/private money lenders are unable to finance these projects because of regulatory or guideline restrictions and insufficient processes. Zeus CrowdFunding is not a mortgage banking entity or a depository, so they are excluded from these requirements. In fact, banks and mortgage lenders are a key source of referrals to Zeus CrowdFunding. 


 +–How do you know the value of the property?

We have a third party provider assess the value and condition of the property prior to funding. The value is typically underwritten a second time internally prior to pre-funding. This is one of our keys to maintaining more than adequate leverage. 


 +–What is the typical transaction structure?

Zeus CrowdFunding is provided as real estate financing collateralized against the quick-sale value of the property in question. These transactions are funded in the 1st-lien position, meaning that in the event of a default, the Z-Crowd members are the first creditors to receive remuneration. Zeus CrowdFunding is based on a percentage of the quick-sale value of the subject property. This is called the Loan-to-Value or LTV ratio and is typically between 60-70% of the value of the property. For the purposes of determining an LTV, the word “value” is defined as the value of the property after the necessary renovations to market the property at its highest and best use. This is often referred to as the After-Repair-Value or ARV. 


 +–How much money can I borrow for my project?

Typically we fund between 60% and 75% of the ARV (After Repair Value) of the subject property for existing structures.  The average for builders is 50%.  With a higher ARV, you may pay higher points.


 +–How much do I need to have in assets?

You need the greater of the two:  $20K or 2x the cost of repairs + closing costs.


 +–Can I use property as an asset?

Yes, you can use property as an asset if it is owned free and clear and is located in an area we serve.


 +–What will my closing costs be?

Closing costs will include 12 months of insurance on the subject property, the first monthly payment, and about $20k or 2x the cost of repairs.


 +–Why do I need to pay a whole year’s worth of homeowners insurance if the loan is for just 6 months?

This practice protects you from possible lapses. Also, most insurance companies will refund you a portion of what you paid or give it to you as a credit.


 +–If I had this much money, why would I want to borrow or crowdfund?

The benefit is to be able to use “other people’s money” while keeping your money as free working capital.  Speak to your CPA about possible tax benefits of borrowing for repairs and renovations.


 +–Is there a limit to the number of properties I can have?

No. However, if you plan to keep the property, you will need to show 6 months of reserves for the PITI (Principle Interest Taxes and Insurance) for all investment properties as well as 6 months of HOA fees for all properties.  If you have more than 4 properties financed, you will also need to have a credit score above 720.


 +–I want to borrow money to build on land I own.  Can you fund that?

Yes. The percent of ARV will be approximately 50%. Ideally the land should be worth twice as much as the structure.


 +–What happens if I sell the property before my 6-month term is up?

No problem.  There are no prepayment penalties.  Additionally, you will only be charged interest on money you actually borrowed; so you would not be charged interest on any renovation money you have not drawn.


 +–How much does it cost to make a draw?

Typically, the cost of the required inspection is approximately $150.  Although you may request draws as frequently as you wish, you may want to consider batching draw requests and submitting less frequently so as to incur fewer inspection charges.


 +–Why do you need so many documents?

Actually only a copy of your license and bank statements is required.  However, the prefunded amount will likely be less and the cost to borrow higher.  The more information you can provide, the easier it is to provide you with the very best deal.


 +–Can I get gap financing?

Yes. If you need financing on your next purchase while waiting on the sale of your property, our Crowdfunding specialists can help you arrange the necessary bridge funding. 


 +–Can foreign nationals be Borrowers with Zeus CrowdFunding?

Yes. Of course it will depend on the deal itself, proper identification, and verifiable assets.  ARV for foreign nationals will likely be about 50% to 60%.


 +–What do I need to get Fast Track (4-day) funding?

Preparation and organization is the key to Fast Track funding. To get Fast Track funding, you need to have the following in place the day you request Fast Track:1. An existing survey done within the past 7 years2. Clear Title paperwork3. All requested client docs uploaded by the day you ask for Fast Track funding.4. An expedited appraisal request to your Borrower Specialist (requires an extra fee).Be sure your Borrower Specialist knows up front that Fast Track is your goal.


 +–What do you need to buy property at an auction?

There are 2 things you need to buy property an auction if you aren’t paying cash.  First, the auction needs to allow for financing by Hard Money. Second, you need a Proof of Funds letter from Zeus CrowdFunding.  Simply ask a Borrower Specialist at Zeus CrowdFunding for a Proof of Funds letter for the amount you’re willing to spend on the bid.  It’s that easy!


 +–How do I get 100% of costs funded?

If the money you need (Acquisition Price + Repair Costs + Fees) equals or is less than the money you qualify for (Funding Amount based on the percent of the property’s appraised after repair value) you essentially get 100% of your project financed!


 +–What does it take to get that 6.87% interest rate?
Blended interest rates as low as 6.87% are possible on Buy & Hold combo projects (short term financing for the acquisition and repairs converting to long term financing). For the very best terms one would need :
• A credit score greater than 720• 75% of the project costs or $100,000 in reserves after closing (whichever is greater)• A maximum loan amount of $400,000• Acquisition cost, repairs costs, and closing costs not exceeding 70% of the appraised value.





 ––How long has Zeus CrowdFunding been in business?

Our founding company, Zeus Mortgage Bank, is ranked as one of the fastest growing companies in the United States by Inc. Magazine and the Houston Business Journal. We have been working with borrowers and investors for over a decade and have funded over $150M in offline crowdfunding transactions. Now with Zeus CrowdFunding, we are bringing that vast experience and expertise online. We’re using the latest technology, and we’re making those advantages available to even more borrowers and investors.


 +–What happens if a project fails?

That rarely happens. Zeus CrowdFunding primarily funds in the first lien position between 50%-75% of the property’s “quick-sale-value” and only funds to very well or uniquely qualified borrowers. However, if a non-performing asset is acquired, it will be immediately stabilized and marketed for resale. The excess equity typically offsets the investment, return, and costs. In many cases, these resale opportunities can create additional unexpected returns. In the very rare occurrence of a shortfall, Zeus CrowdFunding uses reserves to close the transaction for the individual investors who selected the guaranteed investment option at the time of investment. The guaranteed investment option guarantees the investor protection from loss of principal. 


 +–What’s the difference between Guaranteed and Non-Guaranteed investments?

Guaranteed Investments pay a lower rate of return, but guarantee the investor protection from loss of principal. Non-Guaranteed investments pay a higher rate of return, but the principal is more at risk. That said, Zeus CrowdFunding primarily funds in the first lien position and is very thorough in their due diligence. After all, we fund every project before we offer it to the investors, and we don’t receive any origination fees until investors are paid.


 +–What does Semi-Liquid mean? Can I get my investment back early?

The investor should anticipate a 12-60 month holding period based on their selected investment. However, the average Zeus CrowdFunding investment is complete well before maturity, and our current average project only lasts approximately 5 months. Should an investor require early withdrawal/redemption, the Zeus CrowdFunding Semi-Liquid Withdrawal Option™ takes approximately 2 weeks and includes pro-rata yields or discounts. Investors can cash-out or withdraw their full or partial investment at anytime with our Semi-Liquid Withdrawal Option™.


 +–Will my money be shared or pooled or mixed with other investors in several investments?

Each investor is paired directly to a single borrower and a single property, and is not part of a pool. The investor’s funds are used for a specific transaction (i.e., a specific borrower and a specific property) and their funds are never pooled and shared with other investor funds on multiple projects.


 +–Who is the typical investor?

We do the investing for you, so you don’t have too. Investors who see the value in diversification, leverage, and real estate, but are not prepared or trained to locate, underwrite, and service their own private loans, align with Zeus CrowdFunding for the concierge investment experience. We underwrite and prefund every project so our investors can enjoy true semi-liquid passive returns on their investments. 


 +–Who can be an investor?

Accredited investors (investors who make a minimum of $200,000 per year or have $1M in assets) can invest as little as $5000 per project up to the total amount being funded.


 +–How much does it cost me to invest?

If you are not yet accredited, you may see a small charge for accreditation processing.  Other than that, there is NO CHARGE to the Z-Crowd Investors!  Simply invest as little as $5000 in the project(s) of your choice and start earning interest payments right away!


 +–What’s the story on the Funding Bonus?  How do I get a $1,000 bonus?

Investors who invest $50,000 or more in a single transaction on one property are eligible for a funding bonus.
If you invest $50,000 to $99,999 in that single transaction, you receive a bonus equal to 0.5% of the amount you invested. For example:  If you invest $70,000 in a single transaction on one property, your bonus would be $350.
If you invest $100,000 or more in that single transaction on one property, you receive 1% of the amount you invested as a bonus. For example: If you invest $150,000 in a single transaction on one property, your bonus would be $1,500.
The Funding Bonus is paid when the project is completed and you receive your principal payoff.






––What is PCI Compliance?

PCI stands for Payment Cards Industry (PCI) and refers to all those business associated with providing and processing credit cards, including debit and pre-paid cards.The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) is an assembly of the major credit card providers that organized in 2006 to set global standards for accepting and processing credit card information. The PCI SSC put forth a set of requirements designed to provide a consistent set of security measures for all merchants to follow when they are handling card transactions.Zeus CrowdFunding does not store or pass information for credit card processing through the Zeus CrowdFunding site, itself.  Zeus CrowdFunding uses well-regarded PCI compliant 3rd party processors to ensure the utmost security of your data.


 +–What is AML Compliance?

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules associated with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) are specifically for PORTALS (an intermediary that doesn’t hold funds) and BROKER DEALERS (an entity that engages in the business of trading securities for its own account or on behalf of its customers).  Zeus CrowdFunding is neither but an ISSUER (entity that develops, registers, and sells securities.) In that regard, the AML obligation processes required by the BSA do not apply.You can rest assured that Zeus CrowdFunding rigorously follows regulation developments as they continue to evolve and complies with all applicable Federal and State requirements.


 +–How does Zeus CrowdFunding make money?

Zeus CrowdFunding is a direct lender, not just a broker or “investment matchmaking portal.”  Zeus CrowdFunding funds projects directly and then keeps a small portion of the interest a Borrower pays while paying the bulk of the interest to the project’s Z-Crowd Investors.  As with any lender, Zeus CrowdFunding charges an origination fee; but unlike any other lender, Zeus CrowdFunding collects the origination fee AFTER the project is complete and the Borrower pays off the loan.This unique arrangement means that: 1) it takes less cash upfront for the Borrower to close, 2) the Borrower doesn’t have to wait on Investors to get funded and can get started on their project right away, 3) Z-Crowd Investors don’t have to wait for a project to be fully funded by other investors to start earning on their investment, and 4) Zeus CrowdFunding doesn’t get paid their fee until Z-Crowd Investors are repaid their principal.  That’s how much Zeus CrowdFunding is invested in the success of both the Borrowers and the Investors.








A
Abatement
The act of reducing something such as a taxes or rent for some period of time or of eliminating something permanently.
Absorption
An estimate of the new occupancy, or amount of inventory that is being “absorbed,” of a particular type of land use.
Gross absorption is a measure of the total square feet leased over a specified period with no consideration given to space vacated in the same geographic area during the same time period.
Acceleration Clause
A term in a loan agreement that requires the borrower to pay off the loan immediately under certain conditions. In the absence of such a clause, then a default on one payment would be just that: only one payment in default.  Acceleration clauses make the full amount of principal due (immediately, or after a short grace period) upon the default as specified in the loan documents.
Accredited (Investor)
An accredited investor is a term used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Regulation D to refer to investors who are financially sophisticated and have a reduced need for the protection provided by certain government filings. Accredited investors include individuals, banks, insurance companies, employee benefit plans, and trusts. As per federal law, a natural person with either $1,000,000 or more in net worth (excluding primary residence) or $200,000 annual income (or $300,000 with spouse) for past two years and reasonable expectation of same for current year.
Accrue
Accrue is a benefit or sum of money being received by someone in regular or increasing amounts over time: In finance, “accrue” is most commonly used when referring to interest, income and expenses of an individual or business.
Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)
Adjustable-Rate Mortgage in short ARM is a mortgage on which the interest rate is not fixed for the entire life of the loan. The rate is fixed for a period at the beginning, called the “initial rate period,” but after that it may change based on movements in an interest rate index.
Adjusted Tax Basis
The net cost of an asset after adjusting for various tax-related items and such reduced and adjusted basis is referred as Adjusted Tax Basis. In real estate terms, this is generally the original cost of property (the original tax basis) less any depreciation deductions plus any capital expenditures.  The adjusted tax basis is important when determining final taxes (and tax rates) upon the sale of a property.
Amortization
Amortization is the paying off of debt with a fixed repayment schedule in regular installments over a period of time. Each repayment installment of an amortizing loan consists of both principal and interest.
Anchor Tenant
Anchor tenant is a major or key tenant is one of the larger stores in a shopping mall or shopping center. These stores are “destination” stores and provide exposure to smaller, satellite stores
Ancillary Tenant
A shopping center tenant that occupies a smaller space and is less of a draw than an anchor tenant. Ancillary Tenants typically pay higher rents relative to anchor tenants.
Angel (Investor)
An Angel investor is a prosperous individual who provides capital for a business start-up, usually in exchange for an equity ownership interest. The term “angel” arose in the entertainment industry, where investors would bankroll a production for a share of the profits.
Appreciation
An increase in an asset value is referred to as “appreciation”.
Appraisal
An estimate of value, generally made by a professional appraiser who uses their knowledge of the local area and recent sales in that area and concludes to provide a guide as to the price that might be obtained for a particular property. An appraisal of a property might be made not only to determine a reasonable offering price in a sale, but also to determine an appropriate loan size of a loan, to allocate a purchase price between land and building (improvements), to determine an appropriate amount of hazard insurance, or for estate tax purposes at the owner’s death.
As Is
Without Guarantees as to condition, as in a sale.  May signal a problem in condition, or may merely indicate that the seller is not in a position to attest as to the property’s condition (as in a sheriff’s sale following a foreclosure). Premises must be accepted by a buyer or tenant as they are, including physical defects (other than hidden — or latent — defects).
Assumable Loan
A mortgage loan that allows a new purchaser to undertake the obligation of the loan with no change in loan terms.  This is generally true of loans without due-on-sale clauses.  Most FHA and VA mortgages are assumable.
Audit
An audit is a professional and independent examination of a company’s financial statements and accounting documents following generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under the JOBS Act, companies that look to raise over $500,000 must have audited financial statements. This is not like an audit from the IRS, which by contrast, is an examination of a taxpayer’s return to verify whether the proper amounts of taxes have been paid.


B
Balance
The amount left over after subtracting the amount owed (on a loan) or the amount remaining (in an account).
Balloon Payment
A balloon payment mortgage is a mortgage which does not fully amortize over the term of the note, thus leaving a balance due at maturity.
Example: A debt requires interest-only payments annually for five (5) years, at the end of which time the principal balance (a balloon payment) becomes due.
Basis (Tax)
The point from which gains, losses, and depreciation deductions are computed.  Generally the cost, or purchase price, of an asset.
Basis Point
A basis point is a unit of measure used in finance to describe the percentage change in the value or rate of a financial instrument. A basis point (bps) is a unit that is equal to 1/100th of 1%, in other words one basis point is equal to 0.01%, and similarly a 1% change is equal to a 100 basis point change.
Blind Pool
An investment program in which funds are invested into an entity without investors knowing which properties will be purchased.
Bridge Loan
A bridge loan is a type of short-term loan, typically taken out for a period of 2 weeks to 3 years pending the arrangement of larger loan or longer-term financing.
Broker Price Opinion
The estimated value of a property as determined by a real estate broker or other qualified individual or firm. A broker price opinion is based on the characteristics of the property being considered..  A fee may be charged for this service, but it may not be represented as an appraisal.  While lenders typically require an appraisal for mortgage lending purposes, some (particularly in the asset-based lending sector) may be content with a broker’s price opinion.
Broker-Dealer
A broker-dealer is a person or company that is in the business of buying and selling securities—stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and certain other investment products—on behalf of its customers (as broker), for its own account (as dealer).  In reference to “Crowdfunding,” one of the two types of “Intermediaries” (“Portals” being the other) authorized by the “JOBS Act” to handle the sale of crowd-funded securities (i.e. equity or debt instruments) by an “issuing company”. Broker-dealers are regulated by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (a “Self-Regulatory Organization” or “SRO”), and sometimes the various states.
Buy and Hold
In real estate, Buy and Hold is an investment strategy whereby an investor purchase and property and holds it for a long period of time, typically using the property for rental income. “Buy and hold” investments can be contrasted to “fix and flip” purchases, where investors seek only to make some basic repairs or improvements and then to sell the property as quickly as possible.
Buy-Sell Clause
An agreement among partners, LLC members, or stockholders in which some partners / members / stockholders agree to buy the interests of others, upon some event.
Blue Sky Laws
State specific regulations in the United States meant to protect investors from fraud. These laws vary from state to state, but in general they require the registration of all securities offerings and sales with each state’s appropriate regulatory agency.

Capital Gain
Gain on the sale of a capital asset like real property.  Capital gains enjoyed on assets held for a long term (generally at least one year) often enjoy lower tax rates than ordinary income.
Cash Flow
Periodic payments available after deducting all other expenses applicable to rental income, including operating and financing expenses. Can be contrasted with net operating income, which deducts from gross rental income the various operating expenses, but which does not also factor in the effect of financing expenses.
Cash on Cash Return
The cash on cash return is a simple ratio measurement of an investor’s return in relation to the cash actually invested.  The cash on cash ratio is determined by dividing the before-tax cash flow (net operating income less debt payments) and dividing it by the initial equity investment.
Commercial Property
Property designed for uses other than personal residential purposes, often times related to business activity. Commercial property includes (among other things) retail shopping centers, multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings, hotels and motels, and self-storage facilities.
Comparative or Competitive Market Analysis
An estimate of the value of a property using some indicators taken from sales of comparable properties (such as price per square foot).  These value estimates, similar to a broker’s price opinion, are not appraisals and do not meet the standards of appraisal as defined by regulatory bodies.
Compound Interest
Interest paid on the original principal and also on any accumulated (accrued) and unpaid interest.
Each year, interest is received on previously earned but undistributed interest, so interest compounds.

Credit Score
Credit score refers to FICO score, which is created and calculated by the Fair Isaac Corporation and it is a measure of an individual’s creditworthiness. This number predicts the probability that a person will repay a loan.  The score is estimated from information contained in the individual’s credit report. The higher the score, the better the risk.
Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding is the process of raising financial support for a venture via smaller amounts from multiple investors (“the crowd”).
Crowdfunding without the expectation of financial return, or with the promise of a specific good or service, are termed “donation-based” or “reward-based” crowdfunding, are in the nature of charitable solicitation or business marketing.
Soliciting funds in return for an ownership interest or the expectation of repayment are termed “equity-based” or “debt-based” crowdfunding (together grouped as “securities-based” crowdfunding), and until recently effectively prevented by federal and state securities law.  One of the most significant parts (Title III) of the federal Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act of 2012 specifically enabled and legalized “security-based crowdfunding,” subject to a variety of regulations and restrictions.

Discounted Cash Flow
A method of investment analysis in which anticipated future cash income from an investment is estimated and converted into a rate of return (generally the internal rate of return, or IRR) based on the time value of money.  Alternatively, when a rate of return is specified, a net present value of an investment can be estimated.
Donation Crowdfunding
Donation-based crowdfunding is a way to source money for a project by asking a large number of individuals and businesses to donate a small amount to it. Often donation crowdfunding is most successful among charities and non-profits.

Neither we nor anyone else guaranties the results reflected in financial projections.
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state agency has reviewed the investment opportunities listed on the Site.

We will not make credit decisions based on race, religion, or other protected categories.

Any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Site or our Services, Privacy Policy, or Terms of Use that you may have against the Company, other than Excluded Claims (as defined below), shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration, rather than through the court system.
Any claim we may have against you arising out of your activities with respect to the Site, other than Excluded Claims (as defined below), shall similarly be resolved exclusively by arbitration. 
This arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA (“Rules and Procedures”) (available at http://www.adr.org).
The arbitration shall be held in Austin, Texas, or at another location that you and we select by mutual agreement.

Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our rights with respect to subsequent breaches.
