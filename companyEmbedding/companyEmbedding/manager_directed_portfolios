Portfolio Management 
What is New Product Portfolio Management? A vital question in the product innovation battleground is,  "How should corporations
            most effectively invest their R&D and new product development resources?" That is
            what portfolio management is all about: resource allocation to achieve corporate product
            innovation objectives.             Today's new product projects decide tomorrow's product/market profile of the firm. An estimated
            50% of a firm's current sales come from new products introduced in the market within the
            previous five years. Much like stock market portfolio managers, senior executives who optimize
            their R&D investments have a much better opportunity of winning in the long run. But
            how do winning companies manage their R&D and product innovation portfolios to achieve
            higher returns from their investments?   There are many different approaches with no easy answers. However, it is a problem that
            every company addresses to produce and maintain leading edge products. Portfolio management
            for new products is a dynamic decision process wherein the list of active new products and
            R&D
            projects is constantly revised. In this process, new projects are evaluated, selected, and
            prioritized. Existing projects may be accelerated, killed, or de-prioritized and resources
            are allocated (or reallocated) to the active projects. 
Portfolio Management - A Problem Area!
            Recent years have witnessed a heightened
            interest in portfolio management, not only in the technical community, but in the CEO's office
            as well. Despite its growing popularity, recent benchmarking studies have identified portfolio
            management as the weakest area in product innovation management. Executive teams confess
            that  serious Go/Kill decision points rarely exist and, more specifically, criteria for making
            the Go/Kill decision are non-existent. As a result, companies are experiencing too many projects
            for the limited resources available!
Goals of Portfolio Management While the portfolio methods vary greatly from company to company, the common denominator
            across firms are the goals executives are trying to achieve. According to 'best-practice'
            research by Dr. Cooper and Dr. Edgett, five main goals dominate the thinking of successful
            firms: 1. Value Maximization
            Allocate resources to maximize the value of the portfolio via a number of key objectives
            such as profitability, ROI, and acceptable risk. A variety of methods are used to achieve
            this maximization goal, ranging from financial methods to scoring models.  2. Balance
            Achieve a desired balance of projects via a number of parameters: risk versus return; short-term
            versus long-term; and across various markets, business arenas and technologies. Typical methods
            used to reveal balance include bubble diagrams, histograms and pie charts. 3. Business Strategy Alignment
            Ensure that the portfolio of projects reflects the company’s product innovation strategy
            and that the breakdown of spending aligns with the company’s strategic priorities.
            The three main approaches are: top-down (strategic buckets); bottom-up (effective gatekeeping
            and decision criteria) and top-down and bottom-up (strategic check). 
 4. Pipeline Balance 
            Obtain the right number of projects to achieve the best balance between the pipeline resource
            demands and the resources available. The goal is to avoid pipeline gridlock (too many projects
            with too few resources) at any given time. A typical approach is to use a rank ordered priority
            list or a resource supply and demand assessment.  5. Sufficiency
            Ensure the revenue (or profit) goals set out in the product innovation strategy are achievable given
            the projects currently underway. Typically this is conducted via a financial analysis of the pipeline’s
            potential future value.
What are the benefits of Portfolio Management? When implemented properly and conducted on a regular basis, Portfolio Management is a high
            impact, high value activity: 

Maximizes the return on your product innovation investments 
Maintains your competitive position 
Achieves efficient and effective allocation of scarce resources 
Forges a link between project selection and business strategy 
Achieves focus 
Communicates priorities 
Achieves balance 
Enables objective project selection 

Top performers emphasize the link between project selection and business strategy.
Why is it so important? Companies without effective new product portfolio management and project selection face
            a slippery road downhill. Many of the problems that plague new product development initiatives
            in businesses can be directly traced to ineffective portfolio management. According to benchmarking
            studies conducted by Dr. Cooper and Dr. Edgett, some of the problems that arise when portfolio
            management is lacking are:

Projects are not high value to the business
Portfolio has a poor balance in project types
Resource breakdown does not reflect the product innovation strategy
A poor job is done in ranking and prioritizing projects
There is a poor balance between the number of projects underway and the resources available
Projects are not aligned with the business strategy          

As a result too many companies have:

Too many projects underway (often the wrong ones)
Resources are spread too thin and across too many projects
Projects are taking too long to get to market, and
The pipeline has too many low value projects

Portfolio Management is about doing the right projects. If you pick the right projects,
            the result is an enviable portfolio of high value projects: a portfolio that is properly
            balanced and most importantly, supports your business strategy.
