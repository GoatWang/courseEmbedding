Muller Quaker Dairy JV ends in disappointment, but what went wrong? 
144 commentsBy Elaine Watson+Elaine WATSON 11-Dec-20152015-12-11T00:00:00ZLast updated on 11-Dec-2015 at 17:34 GMT2015-12-11T17:34:48Z



 

 

 


Just two and a half years after opening a $206m, 350,000 sq ft factory in Batavia, New York, PepsiCo and German dairy giant Theo Müller Group have agreed to count their losses and exit their joint venture (Muller Quaker Dairy). The plant has been sold to Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) for an undisclosed sum.
 


 
The move does not come as a complete surprise given that many retailers have delisted Muller Quaker Dairy products in recent months (Müller Corner: yogurt with a side compartment of toppings; Müller FrutUp: yogurt and fruit mousse; and Müller ice cream inspired yogurts), and the brand has also struggled to compete with Chobani Flip, a mix-in concept that has gained a dominant position in the market since its 2013 launch.While PepsiCo was confident the JV could capture a sizeable share of the US yogurt market when it first announced the JV in 2012, and told us in 2014 that it was on track “to achieve $100 million in annual retail sales in the U.S
” owing to a “passionate” and "loyal" fan base, a spokeswoman told FoodNavigator-USA on Thursday afternoon that sales had not met internal goals.The business was not meeting expectations in a competitive and dynamic marketplaceShe added: "We can confirm that on December 10, Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) agreed to purchase the Batavia manufacturing facility owned by Muller Quaker Dairy LLC [DFA is a leading manufacturer of cheese, butter, and dairy ingredients, and a contract manufacturer of several consumer products].“After determining that the business was not meeting expectations in a competitive and dynamic marketplace, it was mutually agreed by PepsiCo and the Theo Muller Group to be in our best interests to exit the joint venture. 
“We are immensely appreciative of the support we’ve received over the years from the community, our customers and the consumers who purchased our products. We are also pleased to know that DFA, the nation’s leading milk marketing cooperative, with nearly 1,400 member farms in New York alone, intends to continue to invest in the community and further expand their production and agricultural presence in the state."    



Asked about job losses, she said: “We value the contributions of all employees and are working hard to minimize job losses as best we can. We are encouraged to know that Dairy Farmers of America, who have agreed to purchase the facility, have expressed interest in hiring several MQD employees. "While this decision was difficult, we are committed to be as sensitive and supportive as we can be to help those affected. As is our practice, we will be offering transition assistance to all impacted employees.”  





"Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) has agreed to acquire the Muller-Quaker Dairy Plant in Batavia, NY. The acquisition is a strategic one for DFA as it is in an important milkshed for us. This facility creates multiple potential milk handling and dairy manufacturing opportunities. We are currently exploring these."  Monica Massey, SVP, Dairy Farmers of America




Asked for his thoughts on the demise of the JV, one dairy industry CEO told FoodNavigator-USA: "What I did see lacked innovation, branding and flavor.  I never saw it as a viable contender - just another me-too product and it was just a matter of time until something like this happened."There wasn’t any brand identity or connection to their name and I didn’t get a sense of a personality for it eitherWinston Lee, founder and CEO of Tarte Foods
, a recent entrant to the yogurt market, told FoodNavigator-USA: "I don’t think their brand resonated with US consumers.  It wasn’t about the product because I thought the quality was as good as the other major commoditized brands like Yoplait and Dannon, but the way Mueller - a German name - was introduced to US consumers was poor. 



 
 

Winston Lee: The Müller brand didn't resonate with US consumers

"There wasn’t any brand identity or connection to their name and I didn’t get a sense of a personality for it either.   Their packaging was very traditional and stale and I don’t think it stood out on the shelf.   I also think Chobani’s flip product was superior in quality and since they were selling for essentially the same price points, Chobani always won and is clearly winning."He added: "The category is moving very fast and is extremely dynamic, not only in product innovation but also how brands are marketed.  Traditional media marketing is dead.  "I don’t think you can buy your way into a national brand with consumers anymore. You have to build it organically and it requires time and patience and a real authenticity of where the brand comes from and how it started.  I would say that Millennials are the biggest driver of this consumer trend and I don’t think it’s ever going back."   



 
 

Tom Vierhile: The brand just didn’t achieve critical mass

Tom Vierhile: The brand just didn’t achieve critical massTom Vierhile, innovation insights director at Canadean Consumer, meanwhile, told FoodNavigator-USA that the brand never really took off in the US: "The brand just didn’t achieve critical mass. I think the market was just way more competitive than they anticipated.  "In our area, at least, the brand never had much shelf space and if you can’t get the shelf space, you’re not going to go anywhere in the category.  Chobani’s continued ascent had to hurt, and General Mills’ revitalization effort for Yoplait was another development that helped raise the cost of competing in this market.  "I noticed recently that the brand was down to maybe two or three facings at the local Wegmans I shop at and that just isn’t enough to make a dent when you consider that yogurt is a heavily flavor driven category where you need an assortment of flavors to complete – even for Greek yogurt. I did go to our local Wegmans tonight and they had three facings of Muller Quaker on shelf so it looks like they are selling through whatever production they have left."He added: "Undoubtedly, the Greek yogurt frenzy has cooled, and that has played a part.  But what has also happened in yogurt is that innovation is spreading to other types of yogurt including Aussie style yogurt with fast-growing Noosa yogurt (supposedly on-track to hit $100 million in sales this year) as well as Wallaby yogurt, Swiss-style yogurt, Icelandic-style skyr and more.  "The market is fragmenting with consumers gravitating to newer styles of yogurt, and this is also changing the market dynamic and posing a challenge to Greek yogurt brands."








 
 


I think the yogurt category is pretty saturated now and getting something new to catch on is tough unless there is a true product differentiation which I don’t see here.  Claims on the website are kind of lame and looks like this brand is practically a dessert. The few reviews I read had issues with ingredients, high sugar levels and that the package labeled “Greek” is actually  “Greek-like” (in small print) which makes people mistrust the brand and cheapens the perception.  Add in unattractive packaging and there you go. Lori Colman, founder of branding and marketing agency CBD Marketing




Chobani Flip: The next billion dollar brand in yogurt?Rival Chobani has not commented on the news, but speaking
 at our Food Vision USA conference in Chicago in late October, chief marketing and brand officer Peter McGuinness said Chobani’s Flip ‘mix-in’ platform was operating at a run rate of $300-$350m and could be the next one billion dollar brand in yogurt.



 
 

Peter McGuinness speaking at Food Vision USA in Chicago in October, 2015

McGuinness, who is planning to take the brand into savory territory next year with the launch of novel sweet and spicy variants, said Flip - launched in 2013 - was delivering incremental growth both to Chobani and to the yogurt category overall by attracting new consumers to the yogurt aisle, and encouraging existing consumers to buy more yogurt by opening up new day parts in which to enjoy it.“We’re now number one in the mix in segment which is growing at around 30% year on year in yogurt. The really interesting thing about this [Flip’s sales] is that it’s 42% incremental, and half of that 42% is people that never had a yogurt, and the other half is people that are buying a second or third yogurt incrementally - so they are eating yogurt for breakfast and now they are eating one as an afternoon snack as well.”



 
 

Muller Corner has struggled to compete with Chobani Flip

He added: “80% of yogurt in America is still consumed in the morning, so we set out to develop a new platform - a highly thoughtful, highly-curated highly delicious afternoon snack. We wanted to create a 3pm yogurt ritual, when you’re bored at work, or coming home from school or soccer practice, something that bridges the gap between lunch and dinner. “It’s called Chobani Flip, and we think it’s the future of snacking, and the next billion-dollar brand in yogurt.”

Muller Quaker Dairy JV ends in disappointment, but what went wrong?
By Elaine Watson+Elaine WATSON, 11-Dec-2015
Just two and a half years after opening a $206m, 350,000 sq ft factory in Batavia, New York, PepsiCo and German dairy giant Theo Müller Group have agreed to count their losses and exit their joint venture (Muller Quaker Dairy). The plant has been sold to Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) for an undisclosed sum.

Saddened
I wondered why I haven't seen this yogurt in the stores in awhile. I am very saddened by this news. This was amazing and I don't even like Greek yogurt but loved this one. Chobani is not a Michigan favorite. I do believe having samples in the store would have helped.  I bought this yogurt in Sams multi packs when they were available but didn't make it to the larger Costco chain.  They were amazing and I am so disappointed.

Whyyyy????? 
Miss it. Flavor of other Greek yogurts does not compare. Also the sides like granola and "chocolate balls" were great!  It was hard to find so yes marketing and branding sucked but if it can be revamped there would be a lot of happy campers !

Mrs
I am very interested in purchasing your fruit up yogurt so I was wondering if this is available to purchase anywhere.  This was my families first choice in yogurt. Absolutely loved the lemon and strawberry.  It was such a fresh taste.  In fact this wasn't the only yogurt I could get my grandsons to eat.  If this is available would you please provide me the information on how to order.

Thank you

For the last year i have been searching for this yogurt. My daughter and I love Muller because they had regular plain yogurt with granola. We dont like all that greek yogurt at all. Weve tried the look a likes like chobani but it wasnt the same. Every yogurt except for Yoplait is GREEK, but yoplait doesn't even make a plain yogurt with granola. So disappointing. We miss Muller!!!!

I'm saddened 
I had never heard of Muller before until I was going down the yogurt aisle of my favorite supermarket and the flavors they offered in the black packaging caught my attention. They were Peach Cobbler, Dulce de Leche and Strawberry Cheesecake that was my very favorite one. There was also a Rasberry one with chocolate I didnt care for that particular one very much. I remember when I tried it for the first time and I fell in love. I started telling family and friends then not long before,  I couldn't find them on the store shelf anymore. I looked everywhere for them.  I really miss those flavors I can't seem to find anything like it even with the Chobani.

Great product, Poor marketing
I have to say, I never saw any advertising for Muller's products. I happened to be in a Wal-Mart and saw the Fruit Up and decided to give it a try. I loved it, but other than that one Wal-Mart, I never found it in any other store I checked in NE Ohio. Fruit Up was a product like no other in the Yogurt market and could have really found a niche; had it been marketed correctly. I had many friends and family try it, and all loved the fresh fruit flavor. Many said it was like a wonderful dessert. So disappointed

Muller's Greek Yogurt is My All-time Favorite
I prefer Muller's Greek yogurt 10:1 over Chonani.  I love yogurt, but rarely buy it now because I can't find a brand which compares to the texture, flavor and freshness of Muller's.  I would be an extremely happy camper if it was brought back on the market.

I thought the fruity floors were the best - maybe because it was separated from the yogurt dying shipping (?).

They made/make the best yogurt I've tried and I eat at least two a day=60 per month! Their problem was in merchandising. You would think Pepsi would have the knowledge too introduce a new product, buy/obtain the shelf space, and educate the retailer. In the stores here that did commit space, Muller had 8 facings in Walmart but they were always half stocked at best, you would be lucky to ever find the one with chocolate bits in the yogurt with cherries in the flip, BEST YOGURT ever!!! No wonder Coke is constantly kicking Pepsi's butt. I wish it were back or that another company would take the brands and flavors.

Muller yogurt 
This is the first review I've written but I feel very strongly about this particular product (Muller 100 yogurt). I would like to address this message to CEO of PepsiCo or Quaker or the person who made the decision to "pull the plug" so to speak on your business venture with Muller yogurt. What a HUGE mistake!!!! I feel I'm a perfect representation of what appeals to the average American woman and let's face it...women buy most groceries purchased in USA...they are the decision makers regarding the purchase of grocery related products. I've been eating low fat yogurt for decades because I'm not a huge meat eater and I eat yogurt for the calcium and protein. I've never found a yogurt I was absolutely crazy about until I tasted Muller yogurt. The other yogurts may have larger market share but that's your fault!!! As you mentioned Americans don't know this brand and overlook it unless they ate it while overseas. In fact the only reason I tried Muller's yogurt is because a nice lady at.Kroger was.walking around with samples and coupons. I like the sample so much that I abandon other brand (Chiobani and Dannon)  and never looked back. Muller yogurt has no comparison. It is by far the best tasting yogurt on market. Chiobanni is way off course who wants to eat dried Crumbles in yogurt! The Flips are  only selling because Muller is gone from grocery shelves. If your company would have spent some money on a marketing campaign to introduce this yogurt to US market it would have overtaken all other brands and believe me there are millions that feel this way. While building plant there should have been a marketing campaign that built to a crescendo until opening. Once someone taste mullers they would have been converted - it was that awesome!!! I'm absolutely sickened by the thought than I can no longer purchase Muller yogurt! !!! Since being removed from store I've tried almost every   brand and sadly nothing comes close. Read the post many others feel the same.

meuller gone !!!!!!!
I am from the  UK but have lived in Michigan since 2006. When I saw my favorite almond Mueller yogurts on the shelf  I was over the moon as I had missed Mueller yogurts. My son doesn't like yogurt but I could always get him to eat the one with the little chocolate balls! So now they have all gone and I am annoyed to be honest. There is only one flavor of Chobani I like and Yoplait is  like a bad version of  ' Ski' yougurt.........not sure if your familiar with  'Ski' buti f you are why would you choose Yoplait if you could have a 'Ski' yogurt!

hopefully they still sell Mueller back home so I can pig out on them when I go back to visit the olds

Most food over here is bland to be honest, not much variety on the shelves, I like to shop the international aisle for something with a bit of flavor, half an aisle that's like 20 feet devoted to different kinds of boring bland mac and cheese is just mind numbing! Oh and don't get me started on your fatty stringy strips of bacon, back home we cut that streaky bit off and give it to the dog. 
Just tried the Chobani mango.....urgghh, loads of very hard chewy bits in it, dear God what a hot mess of a yogurt

What went wrong?
I have tried every yogurt out there and when finding Muller I was in love. I don't like the taste of most of the yogurts, especially Chobani. Muller had the right amount of sugar, nice creamy smooth taste, loved the one with the almonds. Needless to say I am eating a lot less yogurt now.  Will grab an occasional Yoplait now that the regular one has 25% less sugar, but just not the same.

There is none out there that comes close to Muller Yogurt.
We always bought several dozen a week and there is nothing in the marketplace that can come close to it.  I am having withdrawal.  After searching everywhere we learned from someone stocking the shelves at the grocery store that it had been discontinued and the plant "out of business".
I surely hope this brand will be brought back by someone and will keep my eyes open for my favorite Cherry with chocolate bits.  Otherwise I may have to move to Germany to enjoy this product once again.  Their food is better than ours anyway.  Just when I thought we were making progress, it's gone!

OMG, WHY
I loved Mueller yogurt, it was THE best, I dislike Chobani flips. The caramelized almond was my favorite.  No other yogurt tastes as good. I would try to buy a plain and add almonds, not good, cant find a brand. I agree with Laurie, I bought 12 a week for me and family.

Seriously???
Went to get my fave yogurt and haven't been able to find it and this is why?? Seriously I am not biting they weren't selling enough because I always had to buy as much as I could because the store always seemed to run out fast. There is more to them selling and it definitely isn't because they weren't selling enough.

OMG, no wonder I can't find it anymore!!!
I did not normally eat any yogurt until my husband got me some Mueller Raspberry/Blackberry that was on sale at Wal-Mart.  It was so delicious and without any sort of artificial taste.  The berries always tasted like berries and they still had some texture.  I have sampled every other brand of blackberry yogurt trying to find a replacement and I don't think that anything can beat the Mueller one that I used to buy.  I am SO disappointed!

I have to also say that the Chobani flip cup, which we just bought last week because Muller was nowhere to be found, was terrible. The smell!! It was so bad I couldn't figure out what was rotting in my house. It was an open, uneaten container of it in our fridge because my oldest wouldn't eat it. It smelled THAT bad. The rest were trashed.

Muller is hands-down the BEST tasting yogurt on the market! My family LOVED the flip-cups! Soooooo upset we can no longer get this yogurt. Chobani is awful and full of sugar OR full of artificial sweeteners that you can taste. Yuck. Same with all the other brands. All you had to do is put a PERSON in stores and give out samples of Muller and you would have had the nation HOOKED. No, instead you sell the plant! WTH? Lost opportunity for sure here. Trying to locate a worthy replacement but all the shelves are filled with total crap.

I am devastated. Chobani, Dannon and all the others do not taste as good and are rough on the digestive tract for me. This is a major disappointment and loss. This has nothing to do with the fact that this is a "me too product". These  guys were outgunned financially by the other monopoly yogurt manufacturers obviously. What a shame

I cannot believe this.  Ever since I went to Germany and tasted Muller I couldn't stand any other yogurt.  Even my eight year old son will eat the Greek yogurt.  I introduced so many people to Muller and it was always out on the shelf.  I don't understand how they went bankrupt.  Unless they just couldn't meet the demand and made it appear that they weren't found so well.  I just bought yo plait and I couldn't finish it.  All other yogurt is disgusting.

Mueller Yogurt , discontinued?
The best GREEK YOGURT discontinued in the USA?
I could not believe it! - Just getting back from Germany, where this YOGURT has a lot more varieties in the grocer's shelf, now trying to restock my refrigerator, I can not find any Muellers..... until I found this web-site. 
I just want to refuse to believe the story of discontinuing the product. 
Let's be honest: some stores did not even stock enough of their YOGURTS in the display - often enough they ran out of it and just did not get it shipped or they did not reorder enough. 
It may be true that Mueller/Pepsi  may not have advertised effectively. But for a lot of customers this was finally the brand which "brought home a lot closer". Their YOGURT was the BEST and I was so proud to report in GE "we now finally have a great tasting YOGURT".
Too sad, they are not available at this point - I am not giving up hope something good like  this comes back as well as other German goodies, like QUARK -real QUARK-!

Something about the taste, tartness, that just doesn't agree with me. I started eating Muller when a coworker told me about it. It was also a lower price than Chobani, by 12 cents. Fit my budget and my taste. I really miss the chocolate cherry. No one seems to have a replacement for that.

I agree with most of the other people posting.  Muller was great, and Chobani is terrible.
That's such a shame. I'm really surprised to hear this news. It was a nice low-calorie snack...one which I thought was very popular. It was everywhere, even the lunch place in my office building carried it in their tiny dairy case.

It's such a shame that there is no alternative.  I honestly don't know a single person who eats Chobani products, and I don't really understand how they seemed to take over the yogurt section at so many retailers.

Bring back Muller
I used to buy Muller yogurt in England on my layovers and when I stopped flying I was no longer able to buy it. My favorite was the plain, in the large container. You cannot believe how good it was!!Like no other plain yogurt in the world. I would let my fellow F A's taste it and they were hooked.For years I was hoping they would expand over here.I never was able to find 

it in Mn. What a half-assed attempt you guys made. Can you PLEASE try again, BUT, I want you to use the EXACT same recipe you used in Europe, no modifications.

Was the best
The Muller Strawberry yogurt was by far the best tasting of all the brands out there, too bad more people didn't try or buy it, I was purchasing 10 every week, loved it

Bring Back Muller
I can't believe PepsiCo decided to discontinue the Muller yogurt brand.  That was the best tasting Greek Yogurt on the market.  It was never given enough shelf space, offerings in stores and advertising.  I was completely shocked to see this product gone.  I tried all the other brands and thought oh well I will just switch to Chobani.  Chobani yogurt will never compare to Muller.  I

I can't believe it
This is really sad to read that Muller is gone. I guess I just ate the very last one without knowing it.
I was so happy when I saw it the first time in Sam's Club a few years back (the first ones on the shelves were actually made in Germany and tasted a little bit better than the Batavia made ones later).
It tastes MUCH better than the Chobani flips I tried and forget about many other brands that taste like chalk.
Am I biased since I'm German and had my first Muller Granola yogurt just before the wall came down in 1989? Sure. And it was also nice to see something from back home on store shelves. But, I also think, if my memory serves me right, that the Chobani flip came onto shelves after the introduction of Muller. So I always saw theirs as copycat.
Whenever I went to grocery stores (Fry's, Walmart), the Muller section was always picked over, sold out and hard to get. All others were untouched. Sad, sad, sad day.
Alles Muller oder was?

I cannot believe the corner (granola) yogurt is gone!
After so many years of hunting the BEST yogurt ever!!
It's gone.  I shopped at Kroger in the Atlanta area and it was so difficult to find this yogurt and the Kroger stores kept it out for sale until we were told this wonderful tasting yogurt .....the company was going out of business!  What a shame!

Muller
The raspberry chocolate chip corner yogurt was my favorite. The Chobani Flip yogurts are very high in fat by comparison. I think the big problem was that I never saw any advertising for this product. Only one store in Chicago (Jewel) ever carried it, so it's very hard to get a foothold in the market.

Mueller Yogurt
The fact that I cannot get Mueller Yogurt anymore is extremely upsetting to me.  there is no other yogurt to compare with it.  I had it every morning to keep my tummy feeling good.  I really needed it for health.  I loved the flip one with little malted milk balls.  The rest of the yogurt on the market is terrible.  Every time I was in the store buying all I could get, someone else was behind me doing the same.  there must be some way to get this yogurt.  Chobani tastes like sand in comparison.

NO!!!
I've spent 20 years saying I didn't like yogurt until I tried Müller. They always sold out in our store so I am utterly shocked. I just took the last of the yogurts at the store today. This is also the only yogurt my daughter would eat. I hope that they come back, or at least keep the formula under another name? Such a sad day as I know the last 4 in my fridge is the end of my yogurt days.

So disappointed
Never liked any yogurt on the market but  when I tried the Muiller Berry yogurt, I was hooked.  Would buy ten at a time.    So disappointed It is not available in the US anymore.  It was the only yogurt I would buy.  Please tell me it isn't so.

So sad that our favorite yogurt is gone. We have been trying all the "others" and nothing is as good as Muller. I can't believe their numbers were bad, they always seemed to sell well in our market. Please bring it back!

So Sad! 
I finally found this article to explain why my supermarket took my favorite yogurt off the shelves. I thought they were crazy! From what I could tell, it sold really well. I was totally addicted to the Greek with carmelized almonds but they were all really good. Soooo much better than Chobani. Chobani tastes artificial to me. Such a shame. Muller is really the only yogurt I like anymore, I got spoiled. Come back PLEASE!!!

Muller Yogurt
Chobani yogurt had a big annoucement with being on the news expanding the plant and hiring more people.Great to here but why didn't mullers say something  about this yogurt ?I don't like any of the Chobani yogurts! Finally found Muller yogurt and i ate all of the flavors!The greek yogurt was the best!A great find and a big lose!Sorry you couldn't have tried to reached out and stayed !206 million dollars to build may have been a bit to high to start off !

Disappointed
I am very disappointed that Muller Yogurt has been discontinued. The Raspberry/Chocolate Chip is one of my favorites.  I have looked everywhere for it, but I decided to go to the website to see what the problem might be.  I am very disappointed.

Muller yogurt
I agree with everything that has been said; I am from NY and lots of people have been looking for the ice cream inspired yogurt. When I asked at the supermarket; the guy said why is everyone asking for this. If anyone knows of a site to order online, please publish it.

Muller yogurt is the best!
I echo Theresa's sentiments.  If Muller's yogurt did not sell well, it was not because of the product, but because of lack of advertising.  It was never given the chance to be successful.  I have tried other yogurts.  They are just not as good.  I will buy up what I can, and then will probably go back to making my own.

Muller yogurt is by far the best tasting yogurt!
I can't believe a superior tasting product like this will be leaving the US. Many didn't know it existed because of lack of advertising. It should have been given out at the markets sample by sample like other products. A sample paired with a coupon can go a long way. I'm going to try to have it shipped to my home from over seas. It would be well worth the extra money for shipping to have my favorite yogurt back.

Awful Disappointing 
I completely agree, disappointed. I am from Germany and love Mueller, I was just getting ready to contact US based company to get them to sell Mueller Milchreis, and then I find this article. I just found the Mueller corner at my local store on the West Coast 1 1/2 years ago,  and noticed it being closed out already in late 2015. Never saw any advertisement either. Nothing but low fat Greek yoghurt junk on the shelves here, totally defeats the purpose of being Greek yoghurt. It needs to be creamy.

Disappointed 
I really liked Müller Corner and the fruit product, unfortunately they were too hard to find. The smaller neighborhood supermarkets usually didn't have them and even the larger stores didn't always have them. When I did find it, I felt the regular price was too high and it usually wasn't on sale. In comparison, Chobani is everywhere and often on sale somewhere. Also, there seemed to be very little advertising. I saw a couple of internet ads in the beginning and that was it. It seems strange that Müller/Quaker/Pepsi didn't do a better job at advertising their brand.

I want Muller yogurt, NOT Chobani!!!
Why why why is Muller yogurt leaving the US??? Its the only yogurt brand I found in the whole US market that tasted best and alleviated my severe stomach problems by eating 1-2 Greek yogurts w/ almonds every morning....I'm completely devastated that it seems I am now to lose this wonderful brand that I've been buying for almost 2 years, 1, 2 every single day, and I have no options to find them anywhere it seems. I tried Chobani, but don't care for it, Muller was the only brand for me, but what am I to do now??? I'm angry with you, Muller, for not allowing a better ad campaign or something, salvage this market, as you HAVE the superior product, I just never saw adverts for it here, like NEVER saw ads on tv or elsewhere....I don't believe this story as it's being told, I can't believe that with the superior product and an ounce of effort in advertising, that you couldn't have been as competitive as you wanted to be, so whats really going on here??? Who opens a $250 million dollar plant and only gives it a little more than 24 months to capture the majority of the market with NO ADVERTISING?!?!?! What REALLY happened to you, Muller???????? I'm angry, devastated, and now look forward to suffering again without your wonderful brand of yogurt that others in the world will continue to enjoy, but not me apparently, because I'm unlucky enough to have to live in the f'ing US.... You really blew it by pulling out of the US without seeming to even try to really make your mark here, I'm completely disappointed in you, Muller/Quaker....I bet this is really all just over multi-million dollar back-door deals, bribes or some such other nefarious business because this really makes NO sense whatsoever.

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
