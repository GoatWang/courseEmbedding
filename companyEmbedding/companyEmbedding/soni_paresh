Drug PatentA drug patent is assigned by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and assigns exclusive legal right to the patent holder to protect the proprietary chemical formulation. The patent assigns exclusive legal right to the inventor or patent holder, and may include entities such as the drug brand name, trademark, product dosage form, ingredient formulation, or manufacturing process A patent usually expires 20 years from the date of filing, but can be variable based on many factors, including development of new formulations of the original chemical, and patent infringement litigation.
Drug ExclusivityExclusivity is the sole marketing rights granted by the FDA to a manufacturer upon the approval of a drug and may run simultaneously with a patent. Exclusivity periods can run from 180 days to seven years depending upon the circumstance of the exclusivity grant.
RLDA Reference Listed Drug (RLD) is an approved drug product to which new generic versions are compared to show that they are bioequivalent. A drug company seeking approval to market a generic equivalent must refer to the Reference Listed Drug in its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA).  By designating a single reference listed drug as the standard to which all generic versions must be shown to be bioequivalent, FDA hopes to avoid possible significant variations among generic drugs and their brand name counterpart.

AASLD has grown to an international society responsible for all aspects of hepatology, and our annual meeting, The Liver Meeting® (http://www.aasld.org/thelivermeeting) , has grown in attendance from 12 to over 10,000 physicians, surgeons, researchers, and allied health professionals from around the world.Hepatology has been recognized as a discipline only in the last few decades, and AASLD played a seminal and unifying role in focusing interest on hepatological problems, as well as the founding of other hepatological societies. AASLD organized the AASLD Foundation (http://www.aasld.org/foundation) to support liver research and provide education about liver disease and its treatment to those providing care to patients. AASLD sponsors two to four Single Topic Conferences (http://www.aasld.org/additionalmeetings)  each year in clinical, basic, hepatitis, or pediatric hepatology. Our two monthly journals (http://www.aasld.org/journals), HEPATOLOGY and Liver Transplantation, and our monthly eJournal, "Clinical Liver Disease" (http://www.cldlearning.com) provide the latest research findings for hepatology and surgery of the liver.AASLD's membership includes ALL professionals dedicated to hepatobiliary discoveries and patient care. Mentoring, the sharing of knowledge, and dedication to professional growth and development are among the core values of AASLD and its members.
