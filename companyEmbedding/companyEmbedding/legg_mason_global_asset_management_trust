The Importance of Working with a Trusted Financial Professional
A financial professional, also known as a broker, can help you achieve your goals by providing valuable insight and guidance on economic issues, the markets, specific investment and strategies. FINRA, The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, oversees the professionals and firms that sell stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other securities. We encourage you to seek out additional information on your current or prospective broker by going to BrokerCheck.

Pricing & Performance
















MUTUAL FUNDS - IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and A2 shares reflect the maximum front-end sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 4.25% for most fixed-income funds and 2.5% for the following funds: Western Asset Adjustable Rate Income Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity California Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity New York Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate-Term Municipals Fund, Western Asset Short Duration High Income Fund, and Western Asset Short-Term Bond Fund. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%, except for ClearBridge Value Trust which reflects a CDSC of 0.95%. Due to market volatility, current performance may be higher or lower than performance shown. Class FI, I and IS shares are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge, but higher initial minimum investment requirements apply. Effective July 1, 2011, Class B shares are closed to new purchases; however Class B exchange privileges will remain in effect. Royce Funds are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge.

							Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels. Total returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance shown excluding sales charges would have been lower, if the applicable sales charge been reflected. Had fees not been waived in various periods performance would have been lower. All classes of shares may not be available to all investors or through all distribution channels.

							A Fund's 30-day SEC Yield is based on yield to maturity of a Fund's investments over a 30-day period and not on the dividends paid by the Fund, which may differ; and is subject to change.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
For further information on Fund expenses, see the individual Fund page or the Fund's prospectus. Please go to the end of this page for additional performance related information regarding Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS, Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS, and certain Royce funds.  
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
Daily Change($) indicates change in the net asset value from the previous business day.
MONEY MARKET FUNDS - IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION:
The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown.  Average annual total returns and calendar year returns assuming reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been reimbursed or waived in various periods. Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels.
The Current SEC 7-day yield represents net interest income generated by the investments for the past 7 days and assumes that the same income is generated each week over a 365-day period. The 7-day yield more closely reflects current fund earnings than does total returns. Yields for other share classes may vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. The Fund's yields reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers, if any, absent these expense reimbursements and/or fee waivers, performance would have been lower.
Please see each fund's individual page for more information regarding fees and expenses.
Daily Change indicates change in the net asset value from the previous business day.
An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.

IMPORTANT PREDECESSOR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Each share class is invested in the same portfolio of securities, therefore annual total returns for newer share classes would differ from those returns for older share classes only to the extent of fees and charges associated with that share class. For an indication of a Fund's fees and charges, see the Fund's expense ratio and maximum sales charge disclosures or the fee table provided in a Fund's prospectus. 
Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to an institutional account (the "Predecessor"). The performance in the accompanying chart and table is that of the Predecessor. On December 2, 2013, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class IS shares. The investment policies, portfolio managers objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act, its investment performance may have been adversely affected. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund. The performance is shown net of annual management fees and other expenses which reflects the application of the Class IS expense limitation agreement. If the expense limitation agreement were not applicable, expenses would be higher and performance lower.
Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to a private fund (the "Predecessor"). The performance in the accompanying bar chart and table is that of the Predecessor. On October 31, 2014, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class IS shares. The investment policies, objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. In addition, the Predecessor's portfolio managers are the current portfolio managers of the fund. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions under the 1940 Act and the Internal Revenue Code to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act and been subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Code, its investment performance could have been adversely affected, but these restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the fund's investment program. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund.

Legg Mason Announces 25th Anniversary of Value Trust

                            Company Release - 4/19/2007 9:00 AM ET



    BALTIMORE, April 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM)
today announced the 25th Anniversary of the Legg Mason Value Trust.  The Value
Trust was Legg Mason's first mutual fund, which was launched in April, 1982 by
Ernie Kiehne, with Bill Miller as co-manager. Bill Miller has been sole
portfolio manager of the Legg Mason Value Trust since 1990(1), and is today
Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of the fund's investment manager, Legg
Mason Capital Management with over $67 billion in assets.(2)
    The launch of Value Trust marked the initial step in Legg Mason's 23-year
evolution from principally a brokerage firm to a global asset management firm
with $945 billion in assets under management. The Legg Mason Value Trust was
launched in April 1982 and ended its first year with $6.8 million in net
assets under management. Today the Value Trust has assets under management of
more than $20 billion.(3) Mr. Miller manages similar products for
institutional and retail clients throughout the world.
    "As the very first investor in the fund, I am proud of the fund's
achievement.  I congratulate Ernie Kiehne, who has been part of the Legg Mason
family since 1967. Over the past 40 years, he has been a critical part of the
evolution of Legg Mason Capital Management and has long been the heart of that
organization.  Bill Miller's long-term record in delivering value for
shareholders over the years is truly remarkable by almost any standard. I look
forward to more accomplishments from Bill and the talented team he has built
and congratulate them on this milestone," said Raymond A. ("Chip") Mason,
Chairman and CEO of Legg Mason.
    In the April 2007 edition of Global Investor, Legg Mason Capital
Management was named winner of The 2007 Global Investor Award for Investment
Excellence in the US Equity category.(4)  In March 2007, Miller was named as
the winner of the Standard & Poor/Business Week's "Excellence in Fund
Management Award" in the Large Cap Blend Category for the fourth year in a row

2017 Global Investment Survey | Legg Mason






























Decoding investor behavior:Bridging the disconnect between hope and reality
Perception vs Reality:Is fear driving investor behavior?
Humans vs Machines:Is technology really the silver bullet?
Youth vs Experience:Will millennials be better prepared for retirement?
U.S. Findings




























Decoding investor behavior: Bridging the disconnect between hope and reality


Scroll Down










From the Global Financial Crisis to changing technology, a diverse world of perspectives shapes the investor mindset. Their hopes and fears. Their financial dreams and realities. The trends and concerns that influence their behavior.
For the past five years, Legg Mason's groundbreaking survey has provided you with invaluable insight into investors' motivations, biases and the complex, ever-evolving landscape they must navigate.

Is the shadow of the global financial crisis still dimming investor optimism? What's missing for those turning to technology for investment decisions? Are retirement savings leaving investors short of "comfortable"?

Explore the outlook of 15,300 investors in 17 countries across Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the U.S. as we focus on three key themes:

Perceptions vs Reality
Humans vs Machines
Youth vs Experience












Perception vs Reality:Is fear driving investor behavior?






Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. But finding a healthy risk balance is tricky and personal for each investor. Our survey found that U.S. Investors are still substantially influenced by the shadow of the 2007-8 Financial Crisis and revealed concerning trends in how investors perceive and use risk. Even those who describe themselves as aggressive investors don’t have an asset allocation reflecting that. And their cautious investments may hinder their long-term potential for higher returns.
It is critical for investors to understand the risk profile of their investments. Here we examine the gap between perception and reality.

Humans vs Machines:Is technology really the silver bullet?






Technology is changing every aspect of our lives, including how we manage our finances and make investment decisions.  If human judgement takes a back seat to the increased use of online data resources, money-managing apps and products that invest our money on the basis of algorithms, the world of personal finance and investment may be fundamentally changed.
To what degree are investors ready to trust their finances to machines, and how important is the human factor in creating favorable user experiences and investment outcomes?

Youth vs Experience:Will millennials be better prepared for retirement?






Are retirement goals falling short across generations?  Baby Boomers seemed to have had it made enjoying equity and bond bull runs and benefitting from defined benefit pension schemes. For Gen Xers and Millennials who are seeking to pay off student loans and own a home, retirement saving may be even tougher.
We discovered that Boomers have many goals still unmet for comfortable retirement. Explore the reasons and remedies for this dilemma and how Gen Xers and Millennials can avoid falling into the same traps.

How Real Is The Global Retirement Crisis?
Experts worldwide are concerned that investors are under-saving for retirement, and may not be taking the risks necessary to close the gap. Are things really that dire? Our survey indicates that savings in DC plans are well behind what investors are likely to need later in life.

Boomers Not Rockin' Retirement Goals

Retirement goal: Make sure that I am debt-free














U.S. findings







Young investors: haunted by the past
Nearly 2/3rds of U.S. investors say their decisions are still influenced by the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–8. But the impact is most severe among Millennials; almost 6 in 10 say it 'strongly' impacts their investment decisions.








Given the long shadow of the Global Financial Crisis, it is not surprising that Millennial investors are more conservative about risk than U.S. investors in general, with 85% describing themselves as either "somewhat or very conservative.”







Young, ambitious and scared: Can Millennials shed their crisis mentality?
Conventional wisdom holds that younger Americans should take advantage of the longer time horizon before retirement to increase their investments  in higher-risk asset classes like stocks.  However, U.S. Millennials don’t seem to have gotten the memo.  Our recent survey showed that on average they hold less in stocks than their elders – influenced heavily by the legacy of the Global Financial Crisis.

BACKGROUND & METHODOLOGY
The Legg Mason Global Investment Survey has been taking the pulse of investors worldwide for the past five years. Our goal is to better understand investors' hopes and fears, their financial dreams and realities, as well as what is influencing their behavior - from the Global Financial Crisis to changing technology.

This year we found investors who are:

more optimistic about investment opportunities but still impacted by the long shadow of the Global Financial Crisis;
increasingly turning to technology to help them organize their finances and make investment decisions, but who still want to know there is a human behind the machine; and
not entirely sure what they need to retire comfortably, but feel that they have not quite met their goals.

This year's survey reached 15,300 investors in 17 countries across Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the U.S. - ensuring samples that are representative of the population of each country. Respondents are aged 18-74, have some income, are employed (unless retired) and are the sole or joint decision-maker for household investment decisions. Fieldwork was conducted through an online panel between January 12th and February 10th 2017. The high net worth criteria in the U.S. was set at $225,000+ in investable assets and individual country equivalents were set. Of the total sample, 3442 qualified as high net worth. There was also a fairly even split between the generations: 5,116 Millennials (18-35), 4,898 Gen X (36-52), 4,925 Baby Boomers (53-7).

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

 Last BU to Update 







 
















 







From acquisition to disposal, the Sage Fixed Assets family delivers a powerful, 
          easy-to-use fixed asset management solution to organizations of all sizes.


Total fixed asset management from acquisition through disposal
Easy-to-use solutions for asset accounting, construction-in-progress, inventory, and reporting
Specialized for your commercial business, nonprofit organization, or government entity













Depreciation
Tracking
Planning
Reporting





Depreciation is an easy-to-use, fixed asset tracking and depreciation solution that empowers you to more easily manage fixed assets throughout their life cycle.
It helps you eliminate time-consuming manual computations, reduces the risk of errors, and aids decision making with easy, accurate reporting. From simple office fixtures to the most complex plant and equipment, Sage Fixed Assets—Depreciation helps you acquire, track, depreciate, and ultimately dispose of any fixed asset in your business.

Comprehensive depreciation engine contains more than 300,000 IRS and GAAP rules
Over 50 methods of depreciation including user-defined depreciation methods
Flexible and customizable to help you work faster and smarter with user-definable fields, asset templates to speed new asset creation, and "Smart Lists"
Includes more than 30 ready-to-use fixed asset reports and fileable IRS tax forms—unlimited custom reporting is available with the optional Sage Fixed Assets—Reporting
Sage Fixed Assets—Depreciation is also available for nonprofit organizations, government and schools, and Canadian businesses



















Tracking provides automated fixed asset inventory tracking and reconciliation capabilities.
An accurate inventory is essential to your organization's internal control of fixed assets, helping to prevent theft, realize loss or damages, and ensure accurate insurance coverage (and costs). An inventory helps you eliminate accounting inaccuracies due to "ghost assets"—fixed assets that are on your books, but no longer at your company. Without conducting regular inventories, no amount of added processes, controls, or calculations can ensure the accuracy and reliability of your fixed asset accounting.

Works with state-of-the-art barcode technology for automated, easy inventories
Creates and tracks multiple physical inventories of assets quickly and efficiently
Conduct inventories concurrently at multiple locations and reconcile in a central database
Check-In/Check-Out feature with activity history enables monitoring of mobile assets
Stores photos, invoices, or other related documents for each asset



















Planning helps you take control of fixed assets before they are placed in service, by providing the ability to track components during the construction-in-progress phase of fixed asset projects such as multi-component machinery, or new buildings.
Take control of spending and streamline your project accounting. Sage Fixed Assets—Planning will keep you organized, collect and track invoices, and easily transfer completed assets to Sage Fixed Assets—Depreciation when they are ready to be placed in service.

Manage a virtually unlimited number of projects of any type or size
Track details including status, contacts, notes, and all the financials—plus monitor both physical and financial completion status of projects
Get a broad look across all projects with consolidated reports, or drill into details at the project, line-item, and transaction level
View at-a-glance budget tracking and project alerts with a convenient "Project Snapshot"
Easily accumulate and summarize numerous purchase orders, invoices, receipts, and tasks
Manage both capitalized and expensed assets
Customize Sage Fixed Assets—Planning for your business using over 45 user-defined fields



















Although all Sage Fixed Assets Business Solutions include a robust selection of pre-built fixed asset reports, many companies want to go further, building customized reports that meet unique business requirements for deeper analysis.
With Sage Fixed Assets—Reporting, you can easily access the data you want and format complete, accurate reports, and distribute them within your company.

Customize the standard reports in Sage Fixed Assets—Depreciation or create your own from scratch with an easy step-by-step reporting wizard
Reports can handle up to 999,999 assets, and you can choose an unlimited number of sort and subtotal options
Create reports that combine Sage Fixed Assets data with other data from spreadsheets or relational databases
Create eye-catching graphs or charts using Sage Fixed Assets data
Export data to Microsoft® Excel®, Lotus®, Word, Adobe® Acrobat®, WordPerfect®, ASCII files, PDF, XML, HTML, and more

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
