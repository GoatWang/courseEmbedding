An assignment agreement is a document used to assign rights and responsibilities to a party. If a party (''assignor'') is overwhelmed with work, and can not adequately fill their responsibilities to an individual or company (''obligor''), they can assign them to a third party (''assignee'').

These documents may include debt assignment as well. The agreement details the rights and obligations for each party, and the terms under which the agreement was made. It may also include the consent and release by the parties, any changes made to the obligations of the assigning party, governing law, information about the scope of authority the new party receives, and other issues.

You might use an assignment agreement if you were hired to provide a service to a business, such as web design, and due to extenuating circumstances, you were unable to perform the obligations you assumed. You would perhaps choose to hire a subcontractor to fulfill your responsibilities, upon consent of the obligated party.
