PRESS RELEASE
NEW CANAAN, CT – Gridiron Capital, LLC (“Gridiron Capital”) has announced the successful closing of its third fund, Gridiron Capital Fund III, LP (“Fund III”), at its hard cap with $850 million in capital commitments. Ropes & Gray served as legal counsel for the Fund.
The investment strategy for Fund III is consistent with prior funds acquiring controlling interests in middle-market niche manufacturing, business service, and specialty consumer product companies in the United States and Canada. Gridiron leverages the experience of its principals’ past family business ownership, their hands on operations backgrounds, and their partnership approach with management teams to help transform and grow the businesses in which they invest.
Fund III successfully raised capital in North America, Europe, and Asia with a cross section of leading limited partners, including endowments and foundations, insurance companies, public and private pension funds, fund of funds and high net worth individuals. Tom Burger, a co-founder and Managing Partner of the firm, said “We are excited about the broad and significant support from both our investors in prior Funds and new investors coming into this Fund. We are fortunate to have such a high quality group of Limited Partners and great people to be partners with. We are humbled by the trust they’ve placed in us and we will work diligently and intensely every day to continue to earn their trust and deliver the best returns possible for each of them.”
