Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

A great place to invest!

    I am not a hotel owner, but listening so far to the Lodging Leaders guests has piqued my interest in hospitality as a part of my investment portfolio.  My favorite episode so far is the RP Rama one where they talk about technology and tracking key performance indicators.  Great stuff!!
  



Love these interviews

    I have listened to a few episodes and the depth of the interview is perfect. I have discovered some new information each time.  Thank you Jon for sharing this podcast with me.  Side note: I took action on one suggestion in my business and it has paid off in a BIG way.
  



Nice touch...

    Sometimes I might not have enough time to go through an entire interview... But the initial audio clip - basically a tip from the interviewee is really a nice touch. Quick and concise tip that I can take and think about and maybe even implement if it applies to me.
