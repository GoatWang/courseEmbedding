Board of Directors :: Aethlon Medical, Inc. (AEMD)

















 
























	About









Board of Directors









 






James A. Joyce
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer



James A. Joyce founded Aethlon Medical in May 1998, and presently serves as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. During Mr. Joyce's tenure, Aethlon has evolved the concept of a medical device to treat infectious disease into a reality of treating infected patients in a clinical trial environment. The resulting Hemopurifier® technology is positioned to treat global pandemic issues such as HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, and pathogens most likely to be weaponized for use in bioterrorism. Mr. Joyce has been an active participant in the emerging biodefense industry. He has testified before Congress on issues related to Project BioShield legislation and the deployment of the Hemopurifier as a countermeasure against biological weapons. His efforts have been instrumental in expanding the definition of treatment countermeasure in Project BioShield legislation to include medical devices. Mr. Joyce recently served on the Project BioShield panel at the Federal Biodefense Research Conference, and was named Co-Chairman of the Bioterrorism/Chemical and Nuclear Security Task Force of the Homeland Security Industries Association. Mr. Joyce actively discusses issues related to infectious disease at various conferences, and has been featured in news stories on CNN, NBC, ABC, and other media outlets. From February 1993 until founding Aethlon Medical, Mr. Joyce was Chief Executive Officer of James Joyce & Associates. Previously, he was founder and Chief Executive Officer of Mission Labs, Inc., was a principal at London Zurich Securities, Inc., and played professional football for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League. Mr. Joyce is a graduate of the University of Maryland. 




Rodney S. Kenley
President



Mr. Kenley has 33 years of experience in healthcare, most of which have been spent in the extracorporeal blood purification arena. Mr. Kenley held several positions at Baxter Healthcare (Travenol) from 1977 through 1990 including International Marketing Manager, Business Unit Manager for Peritoneal and Hemodialysis products, Manager of New Business Development, Director of Worldwide Product Planning, Director of Advanced Product Development, and VP of Electronic Drug Infusion.  During this tenure he conceived of and managed the launch of several new products that have been highly commercially successful including the HomeChoice peritoneal dialysis cycler.
