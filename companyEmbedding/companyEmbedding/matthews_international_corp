Corporate



A Company Built on Quality and Service

Matthews International Corporation has become a leader in the industries we serve by adhering to our belief that continuous quality improvement is paramount in every aspect of
our business.


A 165-Year Tradition

John Dixon Matthews emigrated from his native England and opened up a small shop in Pittsburgh in 1850. A skilled engraver, John Matthews set a simple goal for his small company – to become no less than the pre-eminent provider of the highest-quality identification products and services. Word of his superior craftsmanship and service spread, his company flourished, and – by 1902 – Matthews became a corporation.

In the early 1900s, James H. Matthews, the youngest son of the company’s founder, introduced life insurance and profit distribution for employees – a truly progressive concept for its time. But for Mr. Matthews, it was just a logical extension of one of the company’s founding principles, “what’s good for employees is good for the company and that’s good for customers.”

Matthews’ outstanding growth continued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. When the organization first went public in 1994, it reported sales of $159 million. In 2014, Matthews achieved more than $1.1 billion in sales. Today, the company is divided into three distinct business segments: Brand Solutions, Memorialization and Industrial. It boasts more than 10,000 employees on six continents at more than 100 locations.
 

Commitment to Values

While the organization may be significantly larger and more diverse than it was in 1850, it continues to emphasize the importance of core values as the basis of individual, segment and enterprise success. It calls on every employee to:
      – always be our best
      – be honest with our customers and with each other
      – continually develop our colleagues within our company
      – look for new and innovative products and services to better serve our customers
      – be the embodiment of the ‘Spirit of Matthews.’

“At our core, we share a common purpose,” said Joseph C. Bartolacci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Matthews. “We work hard to create exceptional, high-quality products; we take great pride in our craftsmanship, across all of our businesses; and, we serve our customers and clients with unparalleled service.

History



A History of Making Our Mark™

The history of Matthews International Corporation begins over 160 years ago.
John Matthews
The Early Matthews Storefront
Memorialization
Brand Solutions
John Dixon Matthews emigrated from his native Sheffield, England and opened up a small shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1850. A skilled engraver, John Matthews set a simple goal for his small company – to become no less than the pre-eminent provider of the highest-quality identification products and services.
His first products included military stamping dies, branding irons, ornate engravings and stamps for wooden crates. Word of his superior craftsmanship and service spread, his company flourished, and by 1902 Matthews went from a partnership to a corporation.
In the early 1900s, James H Matthews, the youngest son of the Company’s founder, introduced life insurance and profit distribution for employees – a truly progressive concept for its time. But for Mr. Matthews, it was just a logical extension of one of the Company’s founding principles, “what’s good for employees is good for the company and that’s good for customers.”
Continued Growth and Expansion
Matthews’ outstanding growth continued into the start of the 20th century. By the mid-1920s, Matthews had grown to the point where it needed to be separated into three equally successful operating units: Bronze, Graphics Imaging and Marking Products.
And once again, success followed. In fact, the Company’s Cemetery Products segment has become the world’s leading manufacturer and marketer of cast bronze memorials and architectural plaques. You can find Matthews Cemetery Products all over the world, from a bronze plaque at the top of Pikes Peak in Colorado to the 100-foot doors for the Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority.
The Graphics Imaging segment has become a leader in pre–press services, helping companies create eye–catching and brand–building packaging graphics. This segment played a role in the development of UPC and bar–code scanning technology–a system that has revolutionized manufacturing, marketing and merchandising throughout the world. Marking Products is an industry leader in both technology and quality and one of the first U.S.-based manufacturers of industrial printing inks to obtain ISO 9001 registration.
Yet, whether we are creating a bronze plaque to help identify a local hero or creating a unique retail display to help identify a national brand, we still adhere to the same principle of producing the highest quality products and providing unequaled service that John Matthews started with in 1850. Now in the 21st century, we are poised for continued growth while we continue the vision of a young Englishman who came to America with skill, a few simple tools and a dream.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers

We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
