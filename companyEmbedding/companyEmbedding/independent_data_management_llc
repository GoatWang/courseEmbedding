You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.

SQL Database disaster recovery | Microsoft Docs


























































Restore an Azure SQL Database or failover to a secondary


2017-4-14
4 min to read
Contributors






all





Azure SQL Database offers the following capabilities for recovering from an outage:

Active geo-replication
Geo-restore

To learn about business continuity scenarios and the features supporting these scenarios, see Business continuity.
Prepare for the event of an outage
For success with recovery to another data region using either active geo-replication or geo-redundant backups, you need to prepare a server in another data center outage to become the new primary server should the need arise as well as have well-defined steps documented and tested to ensure a smooth recovery. These preparation steps include:

Identify the logical server in another region to become the new primary server. With active geo-replication, this will be at least one and perhaps each of the secondary servers. For geo-restore, this will generally be a server in the paired region for the region in which your database is located.
Identify, and optionally define, the server-level firewall rules needed on for users to access the new primary database.
Determine how you are going to redirect users to the new primary server, such as by changing connection strings or by changing DNS entries.
Identify, and optionally create, the logins that must be present in the master database on the new primary server, and ensure these logins have appropriate permissions in the master database, if any. For more information, see SQL Database security after disaster recovery
Identify alert rules that will need to be updated to map to the new primary database.
Document the auditing configuration on the current primary database
Perform a disaster recovery drill. To simulate an outage for geo-restore, you can delete or rename the source database to cause application connectivity failure. To simulate an outage for active geo-replication, you can disable the web application or virtual machine connected to the database or failover the database to cause application connectivity failures.

When to initiate recovery
The recovery operation impacts the application. It requires changing the SQL connection string or redirection using DNS and could result in permanent data loss. Therefore, it should be done only when the outage is likely to last longer than your application's recovery time objective. When the application is deployed to production you should perform regular monitoring of the application health and use the following data points to assert that the recovery is warranted:

Permanent connectivity failure from the application tier to the database.
The Azure portal shows an alert about an incident in the region with broad impact.
The Azure SQL Database server is marked as degraded.

Depending on your application tolerance to downtime and possible business liability you can consider the following recovery options.
Use the Get Recoverable Database (LastAvailableBackupDate) to get the latest Geo-replicated restore point.
Wait for service recovery
The Azure teams work diligently to restore service availability as quickly as possible but depending on the root cause it can take hours or days.  If your application can tolerate significant downtime you can simply wait for the recovery to complete. In this case, no action on your part is required. You can see the current service status on our Azure Service Health Dashboard. After the recovery of the region your application’s availability will be restored.
Fail over to geo-replicated secondary database
If your application’s downtime can result in business liability you should be using geo-replicated database(s) in your application. It will enable the application to quickly restore availability in a different region in case of an outage. Learn how to configure geo-replication.
To restore availability of the database(s) you need to initiate the failover to the geo-replicated secondary using one of the supported methods.
Use one of the following guides to fail over to a geo-replicated secondary database:

Fail over to a geo-replicated secondary using Azure Portal
Fail over to a geo-replicated secondary using PowerShell
Fail over to a geo-replicated secondary using T-SQL

Recover using geo-restore
If your application’s downtime does not result in business liability you can use geo-restore as a method to recover your application database(s). It creates a copy of the database from its latest geo-redundant backup.
Configure your database after recovery
If you are using either geo-replication failover or geo-restore to recover from an outage, you must make sure that the connectivity to the new databases is properly configured so that the normal application function can be resumed. This is a checklist of tasks to get your recovered database production ready.
Update connection strings
Because your recovered database will reside in a different server, you need to update your application’s connection string to point to that server.
For more information about changing connection strings, see the appropriate development language for your connection library.
Configure Firewall Rules
You need to make sure that the firewall rules configured on server and on the database match those that were configured on the primary server and primary database. For more information, see How to: Configure Firewall Settings (Azure SQL Database).
Configure logins and database users
You need to make sure that all the logins used by your application exist on the server which is hosting your recovered database. For more information, see Security Configuration for geo-replication.
NoteYou should configure and test your server firewall rules and logins (and their permissions) during a disaster recovery drill. These server-level objects and their configuration may not be available during the outage.

Setup telemetry alerts
You need to make sure your existing alert rule settings are updated to map to the recovered database and the different server.
For more information about database alert rules, see Receive Alert Notifications and Track Service Health.
Enable auditing
If auditing is required to access your database, you need to enable Auditing after the database recovery. For more information, see Database auditing.

Azure Cosmos DB: DocumentDB API | Microsoft Docs


























































Introduction to Azure Cosmos DB: DocumentDB API


2017-5-22
7 min to read
Contributors








Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database service for mission-critical applications. Azure Cosmos DB provides turn-key global distribution, elastic scaling of throughput and storage worldwide, single-digit millisecond latencies at the 99th percentile, five well-defined consistency levels, and guaranteed high availability, all backed by industry-leading SLAs. Azure Cosmos DB automatically indexes data without requiring you to deal with schema and index management. It is multi-model and supports document, key-value, graph, and columnar data models. 
 
With the DocumentDB API, Azure Cosmos DB provides rich and familiar SQL query capabilities with consistent low latencies over schema-less JSON data. In this article, we provide an overview of the Azure Cosmos DB's DocumentDB API, and how you can use it to store massive volumes of JSON data, query them within order of milliseconds latency, and evolve the schema easily. 
What capabilities and key features does Azure Cosmos DB offer?
Azure Cosmos DB, via the DocumentDB API, offers the following key capabilities and benefits:

Elastically scalable throughput and storage: Easily scale up or scale down your JSON database to meet your application needs. Your data is stored on solid state disks (SSD) for low predictable latencies. Azure Cosmos DB supports containers for storing JSON data called collections that can scale to virtually unlimited storage sizes and provisioned throughput. You can elastically scale Azure Cosmos DB with predictable performance seamlessly as your application grows. 

Multi-region replication: Azure Cosmos DB transparently replicates your data to all regions you've associated with your Azure Cosmos DB account, enabling you to develop applications that require global access to data while providing tradeoffs between consistency, availability and performance, all with corresponding guarantees. Azure Cosmos DB provides transparent regional failover with multi-homing APIs, and the ability to elastically scale throughput and storage across the globe. Learn more in Distribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB.

Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax: Store heterogeneous JSON documents and query these documents through a familiar SQL syntax. Azure Cosmos DB utilizes a highly concurrent, lock free, log structured indexing technology to automatically index all document content. This enables rich real-time queries without the need to specify schema hints, secondary indexes, or views. Learn more in Query Azure Cosmos DB. 

JavaScript execution within the database: Express application logic as stored procedures, triggers, and user defined functions (UDFs) using standard JavaScript. This allows your application logic to operate over data without worrying about the mismatch between the application and the database schema. The DocumentDB API provides full transactional execution of JavaScript application logic directly inside the database engine. The deep integration of JavaScript enables the execution of INSERT, REPLACE, DELETE, and SELECT operations from within a JavaScript program as an isolated transaction. Learn more in DocumentDB server-side programming.

Tunable consistency levels: Select from five well defined consistency levels to achieve optimal trade-off between consistency and performance. For queries and read operations, Azure Cosmos DB offers five distinct consistency levels: strong, bounded-staleness, session, consistent prefix, and eventual. These granular, well-defined consistency levels allow you to make sound trade-offs between consistency, availability, and latency. Learn more in Using consistency levels to maximize availability and performance.

Fully managed: Eliminate the need to manage database and machine resources. As a fully-managed Microsoft Azure service, you do not need to manage virtual machines, deploy and configure software, manage scaling, or deal with complex data-tier upgrades. Every database is automatically backed up and protected against regional failures. You can easily add an Azure Cosmos DB account and provision capacity as you need it, allowing you to focus on your application instead of operating and managing your database. 

Open by design: Get started quickly by using existing skills and tools. Programming against the DocumentDB API is simple, approachable, and does not require you to adopt new tools or adhere to custom extensions to JSON or JavaScript. You can access all of the database functionality including CRUD, query, and JavaScript processing over a simple RESTful HTTP interface. The DocumentDB API embraces existing formats, languages, and standards while offering high value database capabilities on top of them.

Automatic indexing: By default, Azure Cosmos DB automatically indexes all the documents in the database and does not expect or require any schema or creation of secondary indices. Don't want to index everything? Don't worry, you can opt out of paths in your JSON files too.


How do you manage data with the DocumentDB API?
The DocumentDB API helps manages JSON data through well-defined database resources. These resources are replicated for high availability and are uniquely addressable by their logical URI. The DocumentDB API offers a simple HTTP based RESTful programming model for all resources. 
The Azure Cosmos DB database account is a unique namespace that gives you access to Azure Cosmos DB. Before you can create a database account, you must have an Azure subscription, which gives you access to a variety of Azure services. 
All resources within Azure Cosmos DB are modeled and stored as JSON documents. Resources are managed as items, which are JSON documents containing metadata, and as feeds which are collections of items. Sets of items are contained within their respective feeds.
The image below shows the relationships between the Azure Cosmos DB resources:
 
A database account consists of a set of databases, each containing multiple collections, each of which can contain stored procedures, triggers, UDFs, documents, and related attachments. A database also has associated users, each with a set of permissions to access various other collections, stored procedures, triggers, UDFs, documents, or attachments. While databases, users, permissions, and collections are system-defined resources with well-known schemas - documents, stored procedures, triggers, UDFs, and attachments contain arbitrary, user defined JSON content.  
NoteSince the DocumentDB API was previously available as the Azure DocumentDB service, you can continue to provision, monitor, and manage accounts created via the Azure Resource Management REST API or tools using either the Azure DocumentDB or Azure Cosmos DB resource names. We use the names interchangeably when referring to the Azure DocumentDB APIs. 

 How can I develop apps with the DocumentDB API?
Azure Cosmos DB exposes resources through the REST APIs that can be called by any language capable of making HTTP/HTTPS requests. Additionally, we offer programming libraries for several popular languages for the DocumentDB API. The client libraries simplify many aspects of working with the API by handling details such as address caching, exception management, automatic retries and so forth. Libraries are currently available for the following languages and platforms:

Using the Azure Cosmos DB Emulator, you can develop and test your application locally with the DocumentDB API, without creating an Azure subscription or incurring any costs. When you're satisfied with how your application is working in the emulator, you can switch to using an Azure Cosmos DB account in the cloud.
Beyond basic create, read, update, and delete operations, the DocumentDB API provides a rich SQL query interface for retrieving JSON documents and server side support for transactional execution of JavaScript application logic. The query and script execution interfaces are available through all platform libraries as well as the REST APIs. 
SQL query
The DocumentDB API supports querying documents using a SQL language, which is rooted in the JavaScript type system, and expressions with support for relational, hierarchical, and spatial queries. The DocumentDB query language is a simple yet powerful interface to query JSON documents. The language supports a subset of ANSI SQL grammar and adds deep integration of JavaScript object, arrays, object construction, and function invocation. The DocumentDB API provides its query model without any explicit schema or indexing hints from the developer.
User Defined Functions (UDFs) can be registered with the DocumentDB API and referenced as part of a SQL query, thereby extending the grammar to support custom application logic. These UDFs are written as JavaScript programs and executed within the database. 
For .NET developers, the DocumentDB API .NET SDK also offers a LINQ query provider. 
Transactions and JavaScript execution
The DocumentDB API allows you to write application logic as named programs written entirely in JavaScript. These programs are registered for a collection and can issue database operations on the documents within a given collection. JavaScript can be registered for execution as a trigger, stored procedure or user defined function. Triggers and stored procedures can create, read, update, and delete documents whereas user defined functions execute as part of the query execution logic without write access to the collection.
JavaScript execution within the Cosmos DB is modeled after the concepts supported by relational database systems, with JavaScript as a modern replacement for Transact-SQL. All JavaScript logic is executed within an ambient ACID transaction with snapshot isolation. During the course of its execution, if the JavaScript throws an exception, then the entire transaction is aborted.
Are there any online courses on Azure Cosmos DB?
Yes, there's a Microsoft Virtual Academy course on Azure DocumentDB.

The MyAgData Story
MyAgData is the creation of Independent Data Management LLC, a team of precision farming and crop insurance experts who know the industry inside and out – including the many hurdles that farmers, crop insurance agents and ag service providers must clear in order to complete the acreage reporting process.
That’s why we banded together to create MyAgData – an intuitive cloud-based data system that bridges the gap between data used by farmers to plant, harvest and manage their farming operations and data required by crop insurance companies and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for program administration. Finally, one common sense solution for single source acreage reporting.
MyAgData is acreage reporting made easy!

How MyAgData Works
THE PROBLEM
Without MyAgData, a farmer’s data is exported from their FMIS and converted (many times by a crop insurance agent or ag service provider) into a format that “talks” with the various systems used by crop insurers and the USDA Farm Service Administration (FSA). This time-consuming process must be repeated for each crop insurer whose products the agent or ag service provider sells and the farmer buys.
One option would be for each crop insurer to develop a system(s) that works with each respective farm management software system, which would look something like this:

A BETTER SOLUTION
MyAgData speaks everyone’s language. This cloud-based system takes data from the farm management system, tractor or combine and creates accurate planting and harvesting reports that meet the crop reporting requirements of most crop insurance companies and soon also the USDA. MyAgData shares only the required data and is designed for future scalability to share other information as systems and requirements change.
Here’s what the simplicity, connectivity and accuracy of MyAgData looks like:
