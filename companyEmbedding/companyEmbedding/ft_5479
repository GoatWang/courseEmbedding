            Are the leaves silk, poly or plastic? If silk (or poly), are they specially treated for UV fade resistance as silk (and poly maybe) fades?
        
Asked by: aanddmom

            The leaves on this tree are plastic and they are special treated with a compound that makes them more resistant to UV radiation. However, nothing is &quot;fade proof&quot; - there is a possibility of some fading over time. How long depends entirely on where the tree is displayed and how much direct sunlight it receives.

About KOHLER

The brand name KOHLER is synonymous with the world's finest plumbing products in the world. From cutting-edge designs and the industry's most notable materials to flawless functionality, KOHLER manufactures everything you need for the kitchen and bathroom, and it's all available at Faucet.com. KOHLER's history of providing customers with amazing faucets and fixtures goes back over a century. Since then, the company has combined advanced technology with an artist's eye to create perfection. Today, KOHLER offers products like kitchen faucets, kitchen sinks, kitchen accessories, bathroom sink faucets, bathroom sinks, bathroom accessories, toilets, bathtubs, everything for the tub and shower, vanities, medicine cabinets, and even bathroom lighting.KOHLER Kitchen FixturesKOHLER kitchen faucets are designed with style, simplification, and perfect functionality in mind. While the main kitchen faucet is certainly one of the fixtures it makes, it's certainly not the only one. KOHLER also provides bar faucets and pot fillers designed to help with food prep and clean up in the kitchen. KOHLER laundry faucets and utility faucets are available as well.Kitchen sinks absorb a lot of daily use, and KOHLER kitchen sinks are more than worthy to take on this task. KOHLER uses the plumbing industry's finest materials for its kitchen sinks, like cast iron, vitreous china, and stainless steel. From self-rimming to apron front sinks (also called Farmhouse sinks), KOHLER has a sink for every kitchen. And pair up a main kitchen sink with a KOHLER bar sink for an extra workspace.As you might expect, KOHLER also helps to round out the kitchen with a helpful host of kitchen accessories. Choose from deck-mounted soap dispensers to basin racks and colanders for the kitchen sink. Cutting boards and wire rinse baskets also make valuable kitchen accessories. KOHLER Bathroom FixturesThe bathroom is where KOHLER truly shines, and it starts with KOHLER bathroom sink faucets. Within its selection of single handle and double handle bathroom faucets, KOHLER has some of the best-selling fixtures in the entire plumbing industry. Choose from a number of different configurations, as well, including single-hole, widespread, the unique wall-mount faucet, and the beautiful and striking vessel bathroom faucet.Select the perfect KOHLER bathroom sink to go with your bathroom faucet. You'll not find a selection better suited for today's bathroom demands than the one KOHLER offers. Any bathroom will benefit from a KOHLER bathroom sink, whether it's a self-rimming sink (also called drop in) or undermount sink. The wall-mount sink provides a truly unique look, a pedestal sink adds a stylish look to a bathroom of any size, and a vessel sink doubles as a striking design element poised to be a focal point. KOHLER Toilets, Bathtubs, and ShowersKOHLER toilets are some of the most efficient and versatile in the entire plumbing industry. KOHLER offers toilets in every size and shape you can imagine, from round to elongated. Comfort height toilets are designed to make sitting down and standing up easier for our aging population. And when it comes to water-efficient toilets, KOHLER is at the top of the list.KOHLER bathtubs are designed for comfort—as well as getting you clean. From the relaxing soaking tub to the rejuvenating air tubs and whirlpool tubs, KOHLER bathtubs come in a number of shapes, sizes, and installation types.

KOHLER tub and shower faucets are also equipped with leading-edge technologies, like thermostatic valve trim with volume controls, and pressure balanced trim with diverters.Don't forget about KOHLER tub and shower accessories, either.

KOHLER shower receptors include the drain; KOHLER shower doors can provide an unlimited amount to the bathroom décor; and shower walls and shower modules can include a number of features like shelves, seating, and accessibility. KOHLER Bathroom AccessoriesWhat bathroom would be complete without its share of KOHLER bathroom accessories? Think of how your bathroom would function without a towel bar, towel ring, or robe hook. KOHLER also has bathroom accessories like toilet paper holders, storage shelves, and soap dishes.Medicine cabinets are one of the most important additions to a bathroom, and KOHLER gives them a look all their own. KOHLER medicine cabinets include plenty of storage for toiletries and other bathroom necessities, and choose from framed or frameless mirrors.KOHLER vanities are ideal for the smaller bathroom that needs storage, a bathroom sink, and yet is still concerned with creating a beautiful bathroom environment. KOHLER vanities are available with or without the bathroom sink, and you can even add a sink separately.Just when you thought KOHLER already had everything for the bathroom, it surprises with a gorgeous selection of bathroom lighting. These are mostly wall-mounted fixtures with one, two, and three lights. Much of KOHLER bathroom lighting is also reversible, adding further versatility.When shopping KOHLER kitchen and bathroom products, you can also do so by its popular collections. This ensures you have access to perfectly coordinated fixtures and can stretch out the theme to the kitchen and every bathroom in the home.KOHLER Popular Collections The KOHLER Devonshire collection features KOHLER's top-selling selection of bathroom faucets and fixtures.

I am extremely impressed with your service. I ordered an HP printer from you on a Wednesday morning, with no special priority shipping, and it arrived at my doorstep the very next afternoon. Not only was your price the lowest I found, but I have never received an order faster.

Mitigating amphibian disease: strategies to maintain wild populations and control chytridiomycosisProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2011Author(s): Woodhams, D.C., J. Bosch, C.J. Briggs, S. Cashins, L.R. Davis, A. Lauer, E. Muths, R. Puschendorf, B.R. Schmidt, B. Shaefor, and J. VoylesSuggested Citation: Woodhams, D.C., J. Bosch, C.J. Briggs, S. Cashins, L.R. Davis, A. Lauer, E. Muths, R. Puschendorf, B.R. Schmidt, B. Shaefor, and J. Voyles. 2011. Mitigating amphibian disease: strategies to maintain wild populations and control chytridiomycosis. Frontiers in Zoology. 8(8): 1-23. Background: 
Rescuing amphibian diversity is an achievable conservation challenge. Disease mitigation is one essential component of population management. Here we assess existing disease mitigation strategies, some in early experimental stages, which focus on the globally emerging chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We discuss the precedent for each strategy in systems ranging from agriculture to human medicine, and the outlook for each strategy in terms of research needs and long-term potential.
Results: 
We find that the effects of exposure to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis occur on a spectrum from transient commensal to lethal pathogen. Management priorities are divided between (1) halting pathogen spread and developing survival assurance colonies, and (2) prophylactic or remedial disease treatment. Epidemiological models of chytridiomycosis suggest that mitigation strategies can control disease without eliminating the pathogen. Ecological ethics guide wildlife disease research, but several ethical questions remain for managing disease in the field.
Conclusions: 
Because sustainable conservation of amphibians in nature is dependent on long-term population persistence and co-evolution with potentially lethal pathogens, we suggest that disease mitigation not focus exclusively on the elimination or containment of the pathogen, or on the captive breeding of amphibian hosts. Rather, successful disease mitigation must be context specific with epidemiologically informed strategies to manage already infected populations by decreasing pathogenicity and host susceptibility. We propose population level treatments based on three steps: first, identify mechanisms of disease suppression; second, parameterize epizootiological models of disease and population dynamics for testing under semi-natural conditions; and third, begin a process of adaptive management in field trials with natural populations.
