Mirae Asset Completes Acquisition of 85% Stake in Horizons ETFs | Business Wire


























































Mirae Asset Completes Acquisition of 85% Stake in Horizons ETFs






November 14, 2011 03:53 PM Eastern Standard Time



TORONTO & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd. (“Mirae Asset”) is pleased to 
      announce that it has today become the majority shareholder of Horizons 
      ETFs Management (Canada) Inc. (“Horizons ETFs”).
    


      Horizons ETFs, together with its subsidiaries AlphaPro Management Inc. 
      and Horizons Investment Management Inc., manages the Horizons family of 
      exchange traded funds, the largest ETF family in Canada by number of 
      funds with 75 ETFs listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and 
      approximately US$3.3 billion in assets under management (as of October 
      31, 2011). Horizons ETFs had until recently been known as BetaPro 
      Management Inc.
    

      Prior to the transaction, announced on July 15, 2011, the majority owner 
      of Horizons ETFs had been Jovian Capital Corporation (“Jovian”). In the 
      transaction that closed today, Mirae Asset has purchased all of Jovian’s 
      58% interest in Horizons ETFs, with the remainder of Mirae Asset’s stake 
      purchased from other shareholders. Jovian’s stake had included Horizons 
      ETFs’ significant interest in BetaShares Holdings Pty. Ltd., which is 
      based in Australia.
    

      Taeyong Lee, who leads Mirae Asset’s global ETF business, will join 
      Horizons ETFs as Executive Chairman. Mr. Lee will also assume the newly 
      created role of Global Head of ETFs for Mirae Asset. In this new role, 
      Mr. Lee will split his time between Seoul and Toronto. Adam Felesky will 
      continue as CEO of Horizons ETFs and Howard Atkinson will remain 
      President of the company.
    

      Mirae Asset, one of Asia’s largest asset management firms by assets 
      under management, will capitalize on the regional expertise of Horizons 
      ETFs’ management team to grow its global ETF business further. Mirae 
      Asset’s TIGER ETF series, which is listed on the Korea Exchange (KRX) 
      and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX), has assets of approximately 
      US$1.1 billion (as of September 30, 2011). With the Horizon ETFs 
      acquisition, Mirae Asset’s global ETF assets under management are now 
      approximately US$4.5 billion.
    

      “We welcome Horizons ETFs into the Mirae Asset family and are delighted 
      to offer our clients more diversified investment products and 
      solutions,” said Hyeon-Joo Park, Chairman and Founder of Mirae Asset. 
      “Our new partnership strengthens Mirae Asset’s position as a global 
      asset management company, expands our product line and will serve our 
      clients across all regions.”
    

      “We are very excited to be part of Mirae Asset now,” said Adam Felesky, 
      CEO of Horizons ETFs. “We look forward to the global resources that 
      Mirae Asset will provide as we continue to expand our ETF business.”

Mirae Asset Introduces New Global ETF Brand -- Horizons Exchange Traded FundsHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Mirae Asset Introduces New Global ETF Brand -- Horizons Exchange Traded FundsMarketwireNovember 5, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareHONG KONG--(Marketwire - Nov 4, 2012) -Important:Horizons Exchange Traded Funds Series (formerly "Mirae Asset TIGER ETF Series") is an umbrella fund with a series of different sub-funds (the "Funds") which are exchange traded funds and which seek to provide investment results that, before deduction of fees and expenses, closely correspond to the performance of their respective underlying indices. Certain Funds are subject to concentration risk as a result of tracking the performance of a single country, single geographical region (Asia) or single sector. They are likely to be more volatile than a broad-based fund, such as a global equity fund, as they are more susceptible to fluctuations in value of the underlying indices resulting from adverse conditions in that single country, region or sector. Certain Funds invest in Asian emerging markets and are therefore subject to greater risk of loss compared with investments in developed markets due to greater political, economic, taxation and regulatory uncertainty and risks linked to volatility and market liquidity. An investment in the units of the Funds may directly or indirectly involve exchange rate risk. The units of the Funds may trade at a substantial premium or discount to their net asset value. Due to fees and expenses of the Funds, liquidity of the market, foreign exchange costs, and changes to the regulatory policies, the returns of the Funds may deviate from that of their respective underlying indices. Investment involves risks. Investors may lose part or all of their investment. Investors should not base on this document alone to make investment decisions. Before making any investment decision, prospective investor should read the Funds' offering documents (available on www.horizonsetfs.com.hk) carefully for further details, including the product features and risk factors, and should consider seeking independent professional advice.The Mirae Asset TIGER ETF Series and its eight sub-funds ("ETFs") have been renamed to reflect the synergies of the Horizons acquisition that was completed last year and saw a quadrupling of Mirae Asset Global Investments Group ("Mirae Asset")'s global ETF assets under management.The Hong Kong-listed ETFs, of which seven were launched on 27 January 2012 and one (renamed "Horizons KOSPI 200 ETF") on 17 January 2011, also stand to benefit from the synergistic relationship that has brought together the global expertise and resources of Horizons ETFs Management (Canada) Inc. ("Horizons Canada") and the strong regional track record of Mirae Asset, which is one of the largest investors in emerging market equities1.Mr. Jung Ho RHEE, Chief Executive Officer of Mirae Asset Global Investments (Hong Kong) Limited, says, "The rebranding exercise will give added premium to the ETFs' heritage as the Horizons name reflects a model franchise with a sterling track record in Canada which Mirae Asset highly appreciates. This mutually-beneficial cross-border partnership will enable us to more efficiently capture investment opportunities around the world, strengthen our aptitude for innovation and create products to meet the evolving needs of our investors in Hong Kong."Hong Kong is one of the leading ETF markets in Asia with assets under management of US$28.7 billion, representing a market share of 23% in Asia2. It has grown significantly in recent years with the number of ETFs increasing by well over 500% since 2007. The number of ETF managers and market makers has also doubled within the same period3."Our vision is to create the largest independent ETF manager globally by delivering passive and active mandates across multiple asset classes and international markets offering choice and flexibility to every investor. The consolidation of our ETFs under the Horizons brand is a first step towards that goal. This change of ETF names in Hong Kong is a reinforcement of our commitment to delivering unique value and convenience to investors," Mr. Rhee adds.On 14 November 2011, Mirae Asset acquired an ownership stake of approximately 85% in Horizons Canada, whose ETF family is the largest in Canada by number of funds with 79 ETFs listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The acquisition boosted Mirae Asset's global ETF assets under management to approximately US$5.5 billion from US$1.1 billion, previously (as of 30 September 2012). Mirae Asset's majority stake includes Horizons Canada's majority interest in Australia-based BetaShares Holdings Pty. Ltd.Mirae Asset's global ETF business is managed out of offices in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Korea, the United States, and more recently, Latin America."Having a unified brand under the Horizons banner will only help us to achieve greater recognition for our global ETF business," says Mr. Howard Atkinson, Global Head of ETF Sales and Marketing. "Our goal is that wherever we go in the world, investors will see the Horizons brand and recognize it as a standard of excellence in ETFs."Having a global brand has become an important part of ETF marketing, with most of the major regional ETF companies being part of global organizations which use consistent branding around the world. "There is a certain amount of trust that ETF investors attach to ETF providers with international scale. We expect all of our investors from the various world-wide markets we have businesses in to know that their ETF investments are backed by a strong global company which has access to a comprehensive network of regional and international ETF expertise," Mr. Atkinson adds.With effect from today, "Horizons" replaces the "Mirae Asset TIGER" portion of the funds' names.

Mirae Asset Completes Acquisition of Majority Stake in Horizons ETFs
			  



























































 
















TORONTO, Nov. 14, 2011 /CNW/ - Horizons ETFs Management (Canada) Inc. ("Horizons ETFs"), which recently changed its name from BetaPro Management Inc., is
 pleased to announce that Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd. ("Mirae Asset") has today become the majority shareholder of Horizons ETFs.


Horizons ETFs, together with its subsidiaries AlphaPro Management Inc.
 and Horizons Investment Management Inc., manages the Horizons family of
 exchange traded funds ("ETFs"), the largest ETF family in Canada by number of funds with 75 ETFs
 listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and approximately $3.3 billion in
 assets under management (as of October 31, 2011).


Mirae Asset acquired a majority stake in Horizons ETFs, including the
 entire stake owned by Jovian Capital Corporation ("Jovian"), as announced on July 15, 2011. Through this purchase Mirae Asset has
 also acquired Horizons ETFs' significant interest in BetaShares
 Holdings Pty. Ltd., which is based in Australia.


Taeyong Lee, who leads Mirae Asset's global ETF business, will join
 Horizons ETFs as Executive Chairman. Mr. Lee will also assume the newly
 created role of Global Head of ETFs for Mirae Asset. In this new role,
 Mr. Lee will split his time between Seoul and Toronto. Adam Felesky and
 Howard Atkinson will continue as CEO and President, respectively, of
 Horizons ETFs.


Mirae Asset, one of Asia's largest asset management firms by assets
 under management, will capitalize on the regional expertise of Horizons
 ETFs' management team to grow its global ETF business further.


"We welcome Horizons ETFs into the Mirae Asset family and are delighted
 to offer our clients more diversified investment products and
 solutions," said Hyeon-Joo Park, Chairman and Founder of Mirae Asset. "Our new partnership strengthens Mirae Asset's position as a global asset
 management company, expands our product line and will serve our clients
 across all regions."


"We want to thank Jovian for being an invaluable partner over the last
 five years in the growth of our business. We wouldn't have achieved the
 success we have today without their early support and mentorship," said Adam Felesky, CEO of Horizons ETFs. "We are very excited to now be part of Mirae Asset and look forward to
 the global resources that Mirae Asset will provide as we continue to
 expand our ETF business." 


Howard Atkinson, President of Horizons ETFs, said "I want to stress that this acquisition really means business as usual for our Canadian investors. There are absolutely no organizational changes that impact the way we run
 our ETFs. In fact, being part of the Mirae family makes us a stronger global
 company, with the ability to further enhance the services and products
 we provide. We feel strongly that investors can only benefit from this
 new partnership going forward."
