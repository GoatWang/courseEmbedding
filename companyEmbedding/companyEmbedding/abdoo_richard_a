Development of a Cost-Effective Spark and Fuel Control System


1982-02-01



Technical Paper




820248
Richard V. Abdoo, Ralph D. Furmanek
Electronic engine control applications have arisen which require performance and capability in excess of that achievable with the existing Ford low-cost systems, but less than the capacity of an available high-performance system. In response to these needs, a new electronic control unit was developed which meets the increased functional requirements at a system cost lower than the existing low-cost approach. The gain in function/cost ratio is achieved through re-partitioning of the control system, maximum use of standard, high volume parts, process commonality with other products, efficient use of microcomputer capability through increased memory density and optimized software, and several technical innovations. The product resulting from these design efforts constitutes an example of the continuing evaluation of electronics as a cost efficient, powerful engine control method.
