Early life and education[edit]
Brigadier-General Joseph Robert Davis was born in Woodville, Mississippi on January 12, 1825, and was educated in Nashville and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Trained in the law, he practiced his profession in Madison County, Mississippi, and was elected to the Mississippi State Senate in 1860.[3]
American Civil War[edit]
Entering the Confederate service as Captain of Militia from Madison County, Mississippi, Davis was soon made Lieutenant-Colonel of the Tenth Regiment, Mississippi Volunteers, after which he served on the military staff of his uncle, President Jefferson Davis, in Richmond as an aide de camp with the rank of Colonel of Cavalry.[4] Commissioned a brigadier-general to rank from September 15, 1862, and confirmed by the Senate only after charges of nepotism were freely aired and his nomination once rejected, Davis was assigned a brigade in Heth's Division, Army of Northern Virginia, which he led through some of the bitterest battles of the war. He fought at Gettysburg (where his command formed a support to Pickett in the celebrated third day), in the Wilderness Campaign, and at the siege of Petersburg.[5][6]
Later years[edit]
Paroled at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, Brigadier-General Davis returned to Mississippi. He died September 15, 1896 and is buried at Biloxi Cemetery.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Brigadier-General Joseph Robert Davis was born in Woodville, Mississippi on January 12, 1825, and was educated in Nashville and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Trained in the law, he practiced his profession in Madison County, Mississippi, and was elected to the Mississippi State Senate in 1860.[3]
American Civil War[edit]
Entering the Confederate service as Captain of Militia from Madison County, Mississippi, Davis was soon made Lieutenant-Colonel of the Tenth Regiment, Mississippi Volunteers, after which he served on the military staff of his uncle, President Jefferson Davis, in Richmond as an aide de camp with the rank of Colonel of Cavalry.[4] Commissioned a brigadier-general to rank from September 15, 1862, and confirmed by the Senate only after charges of nepotism were freely aired and his nomination once rejected, Davis was assigned a brigade in Heth's Division, Army of Northern Virginia, which he led through some of the bitterest battles of the war. He fought at Gettysburg (where his command formed a support to Pickett in the celebrated third day), in the Wilderness Campaign, and at the siege of Petersburg.[5][6]
Later years[edit]
Paroled at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, Brigadier-General Davis returned to Mississippi. He died September 15, 1896 and is buried at Biloxi Cemetery.[7][8]

About Peradon






Peradon Joe Davis 600 Snooker  / Billiards Cue

Peradon Joe Davis 600 Snooker Cue – At Snooker Crazy, we have decided to stock the Joe Davis 600, a classic snooker or billiards cue of yesteryear that has now been reintroduced to the Peradon range with the added benefit of some modern day touches such as the quick action joint and butt end joint. This is a full size, 58 inch, 3/4 jointed cue crafted by Peradon from the highest grade, kiln dried, North American Ash and exotic Ebony.
The ash is carefully selected focusing on shaft strength and straightness.
The Ebony front splice with distinctive Sycamore striped pattern is then hand spliced to the Ebony butt. In order to reduce stress to the timbers the cue is then shaped over a period of time until the final tapered shape is achieved, after which the numerous sanding and finishing processes are then undertaken to achieve a ‘silk smooth’ finish. The cue shaft is then stamped in the traditional manner with the cue weight to the nearest 1/2 oz.
A ‘quick action’ joint that has been precision turned from a single piece of solid brass is fitted precisely 12″ from the butt end to give the shaft length of 46″ and an overall length of 58″.
The butt is fitted with a joint to accept our range of Peradon extensions.
Extensions may be fitted into either the ¾ joint in the cue or into the butt end joint.
This cue features a solid brass ferrule with Elkmaster tip.

Since 1885, Peradon cues have held the highest reputation within the industry . In the early days, the excellent cues made by Peradon were acknowledged by top players in the world such as Walter Lindrum and Joe Davis. This superb reputation continues to the present day. It is probably true that most, if not all of the top UK players have used a Peradon made cue at some time. If you ever get the chance to visit Peradon, it is said that the production directors office shows all the butt plates from Peradon cues endorsed over the years. This collection is definitely a 'who's who' of Billiards and Snooker.

Throughout it's history, Peradon's has been at the forefront of innovation in cue design and manufacture. Leading the way again, in 2002 Peradon introduced a 'bespoke' cue making service that could be used over the internet with it's 'CueWizard©'. Peradon have secured significant timber stocks which enable part prepared shafts to be left to settle and held in stock. In addition to this, Peradon also hold a full range of exotic timbers for butts and splices.

Peradon's experience in making world class cues truly spans the history of the sport.

About Peradon






Peradon Joe Davis Snooker Cue

Peradon Joe Davis Snooker Cue. This full size, 58 inch, ¾ jointed cue is has been crafted by Peradon in England from kiln dried, North American Ash and exotic Ebony.
Peradon Joe Davis Snooker Cue – Manufacture and Specification
The shaft ash is carefully selected for strength and straightness before being turned on a lathe. From here it is machine spliced to the finest Ebony butt timber.
An Ebony front splice and Sycamore veneer is then spliced to the butt section which further enhances the cues appearance.
Once the final tapering has been achieved, the numerous sanding and finishing processes are undertaken to achieve that great ‘silky smooth’ finish.
A ‘quick action’ cue joint to eliminate problems between the two sections has been precision turned from a single piece of solid brass. The joint has been precisely fitted 12″ from the butt end to give the shaft length of 46″ and a cue length of 58″..
In addition, a ‘quick action’ butt end joint has been fitted to accept the Peradon extensions that can be purchased at Snooker Crazy.
It’s worth remembering that cue extensions may be fitted into either the ¾ joint in the cue or into the butt end joint.
The butt has been finished with a Peradon name plate bearing the signature of the legendary Joe Davis. Joe Davis previously praised  the craftsmanship of Peradon and gave the company the sole rights to use his name indefinitely.
This snooker cue features a solid brass ferrule and 9 ½ to 10mm Elkmaster tip.

Since 1885, Peradon cues have held the highest reputation within the industry . In the early days, the excellent cues made by Peradon were acknowledged by top players in the world such as Walter Lindrum and Joe Davis. This superb reputation continues to the present day. It is probably true that most, if not all of the top UK players have used a Peradon made cue at some time. If you ever get the chance to visit Peradon, it is said that the production directors office shows all the butt plates from Peradon cues endorsed over the years. This collection is definitely a 'who's who' of Billiards and Snooker.

Throughout it's history, Peradon's has been at the forefront of innovation in cue design and manufacture. Leading the way again, in 2002 Peradon introduced a 'bespoke' cue making service that could be used over the internet with it's 'CueWizard©'. Peradon have secured significant timber stocks which enable part prepared shafts to be left to settle and held in stock. In addition to this, Peradon also hold a full range of exotic timbers for butts and splices.

Peradon's experience in making world class cues truly spans the history of the sport.
