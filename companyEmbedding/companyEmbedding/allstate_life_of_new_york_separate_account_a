  ﻿How can I pay my bill?
Payment Methods

Allstate offers a variety of convenient ways to pay your bill, including online options, automatic payments or simply dropping a check in the mail. 



Automatic Payments

Use My Account to choose one of our automatic payment options: 

Schedule payments from your checking or savings account by enrolling in Easy Pay Plan
Schedule Recurring Credit Card payments using your credit or debit card 


One-Time Payment 

Need to make a one-time payment online? 

Log in to My Account or use the Allstate® Mobile app to pay today or schedule a future payment 
Use Quick Pay to make a payment without logging in by entering your name, ZIP code and policy number 

You can always use traditional payment options, too:

Call our automated payment system at 1-800-901-1732 
Address your payment to the location listed on your statement  
Drop off your payment at your local Allstate agency 


For life insurance policies, you can pay by:


Automatic payments: A convenient deduction from your bank account or credit card1. Call 1-800-ALLSTATE (1-800-255-7828) to get started. 
One-time payment: Send a check, money order or cashier's check to the mailing address on your statement or call 1-800-ALLSTATE (1-800-255-7828) to pay by credit card2. 


Understanding Your Bill

Whether you receive your bill electronically or by mail, both formats are identically designed and feature the same elements. Use this sample bill3 as a guide to understanding your statement.



For answers to commonly asked billing questions, visit our Q&A.


Make the switch to paperless

Say good-bye to clutter with our paperless options. Sign up for eBill to receive electronic billing documents, and enroll in ePolicy to get electronic policy documents.

2 Variable Life and VUL policies only accept payment by check or EFT

  ﻿We're Here To Help You.

Filing a claim can be an emotional time. Allstate is here to help you every step of the way, making your claims experience as simple and convenient as possible. With one of the largest teams of claims professionals in the country and 24/7 claims support, we'll work to help you get back to normal quickly. You can file your claim online quickly and easily by logging in to My Account. Once you're logged in, you can start your claim and track its progress.


Log in to file a claim 


Register for My Account


If you haven’t registered for My Account, you can  still file a claim online. Flood claims  are handled differently, but you can still file a  flood claim online.


More Ways To File A Claim.

To make filing a claim quick and convenient, Allstate provides you with many ways to file a claim:

Access 24/7 claims service by calling 1-800-ALLSTATE.
Start your claim using the Allstate® Mobile app. 
Report your claim by contacting your agent.



What To Expect During The Claims Process.

Knowing what to expect when you file a claim can help make the process easier to navigate. Though different types of claims are handled a little differently, most Allstate claims follow the same basic steps.



Step 1: File your claim.
Once you file a claim, you'll get a claim number that will help you track your claim.







Step 2: Investigate claim.
We may need to investigate the details of your loss. If so, one of our claims professionals will walk you through the process and answer all of your questions or concerns.







Step 3: Evaluate damage.
A professional will assess the damage, determine what needs to be repaired or replaced and provide you with an estimate.







Step 4: Review estimate.
Once you've received an estimate of the damage, your claims adjuster will discuss your settlement based on your policy provisions, terms and coverage.







Step 5: Wrap up your claim.
Your claims adjuster may send you any applicable payments and can answer any questions you may have.






Staying organized can help you keep track of your claim. Writing your claim number on important documents is a good tip to keep in mind. If you have an auto claim, the auto insurance claim worksheet can help you keep everything straight.

Applicants' Representations
1. Allstate Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Illinois in 1957. Allstate Life's home office is located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Allstate Life is licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York. Allstate Life is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Insurance Company, a stock property-liability insurance company incorporated under the laws of Illinois. All of the outstanding capital stock of Allstate Insurance Company is owned by The Allstate Corporation.
2. Allstate Life established Allstate Separate Account I and ALIC Separate Account A (collectively “Allstate Life Separate Accounts”) as separate accounts pursuant to Illinois law. Each is a “separate account,” as defined by section 2(a)(37) of the Act, and is registered with the Commission pursuant to the Act as a unit investment trust.
3. Allstate New York is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of New York in 1967 and was known as “Financial Life Insurance Company” from 1967 to 1978. From 1978 to 1984, the Company was known as “PM Life Insurance Company.” Since 1984, the Company has been known as “Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York.” Allstate New York's home office is located at 100 Motor Parkway, Hauppauge, NY 11788-5107. Allstate New York is licensed to operate in the states of New York and Texas. Allstate New York is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Life.
4. Allstate New York established ALNY Separate Account A, ALNY VA and ALNY VAII (collectively “Allstate New York Separate Accounts”) as separate accounts pursuant to New York law. Each is a “separate account,” as defined by section 2(a)(37) of the Act, and is registered with the Commission pursuant to the Act as a unit investment trust.
5. Certain variable annuity contracts sponsored by Allstate Life and issued through Allstate Separate Account I and ALIC Separate Account A are registered with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”). Certain variable annuity contracts sponsored by Allstate New York and issued through ALNY Separate Account A, ALNY VA and ALNY VA II are registered with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act.
6. Allstate Separate Account I is divided into 105 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of an open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the Act (the “Funds”). ALIC Separate Account A is divided into 47 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds.
7. ALNY Separate Account A is divided into 111 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. ALNY VA is divided into 11 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. ALNY VAII is divided into 52 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds.
8. After considering the nature and purpose of each separate account, the Boards of Directors of Allstate Life and Allstate New York have determined that the efficiency of the operations of the separate accounts could be improved, and the overall administration enhanced, by merging: (a) ALIC Separate Account A into Allstate Separate Account I ; and (b) ALNY VA and ALNY VA II into ALNY Separate Account A (together, the “Mergers”). The Mergers will be structured so there will be no change in the rights and benefits of persons having an interest in any of the Contracts issued by those Separate Accounts.
9. The consolidation of the overlapping sub-accounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each Allstate Life or Allstate New York owner holding units of interest in one of the merging sub-accounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving sub-account. The values of the exchanged interests under the Contracts will thus be equivalent. The accumulation unit values for these sub-accounts will not change, and the Contract value of any affected Contract owner immediately after the sub-account consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the sub-account consolidation. 
10. The Merger provides for the transfer of ALIC Separate Account A assets to Allstate Separate Account I and the assumption of the liabilities and contractual obligations of ALIC Separate Account A by Allstate Separate Account I in return for the crediting of accumulation units of Allstate Separate Account I to ALIC Separate Account A contract owners. Once this process has been completed, the units of ALIC Separate Account A would be cancelled, ALIC Separate Account A would submit an application to the Commission pursuant to section 8(f) of the Act to Start Printed Page 16294effect its deregistration as an investment company and would cease to exist, and Allstate Separate Account I would continue to exist. 
11. Immediately following the Merger, each ALIC Separate Account A contract owner will possess a number of Allstate Separate Account I units (both full and fractional) that, when multiplied by the unit value of Allstate Separate Account I units, would result in an aggregate unit value equal to the aggregate unit value of the units the contract owner had in the respective Separate Account immediately before the consummation of the Merger. 
12. Allstate Life will distribute to each existing ALIC Separate Account A contract owner: (a) A contract rider indicating that such contracts are thereafter funded by Allstate Separate Account I; (b) a letter informing such contract owners of the Merger; and (c) a prospectus supplement that reflects Allstate Separate Account I as the separate account funding the contracts. 
13. The Merger provides for the transfer of ALNY VA and ALNY VA II assets to ALNY Separate Account A and the assumption of the liabilities and contractual obligations of each of ALNY VA and ALNY VA II by ALNY Separate Account A in return for the crediting of accumulation units of ALNY Separate Account A to ALNY VA and ALNY VA II contract owners. Once this process has been completed, the units of ALNY VA and ALNY VA II would be cancelled, ALNY VA and ALNY VA II would each submit an application to the Commission pursuant to section 8(f) of the Act to effect its deregistration as an investment company and would cease to exist, and ALNY Separate Account A would continue to exist. 
14. Immediately following the Merger, each ALNY VA and ALNY VA II contract owner will possess a number of ALNY Separate Account A units (both full and fractional) that, when multiplied by the unit value of ALNY Separate Account A units, would result in an aggregate unit value equal to the aggregate unit value of the units the contract owner had in the respective Separate Account immediately before the consummation of the Merger. 
15. Allstate New York will distribute to each existing ALNY VA and ALNY VA II contract owner: (a) A contract rider indicating that such contracts are thereafter funded by ALNY Separate Account A; (b) a letter informing such contract owners of the Merger; and (c) a prospectus supplement that reflects ALNY Separate Account A as the separate account funding the contracts. 
16. Except for the change in the separate account funding the variable annuity contracts, all the rights and benefits of the contract owners will remain unchanged after the Mergers. Further, the fees and charges under the contracts will not change as a result of the Mergers. 
17. Allstate Life and Allstate New York assert that the Mergers will have no tax consequences for Allstate Life and Allstate New York contract owners. In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Allstate Life and Allstate New York contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Mergers that would not otherwise be required or imposed. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Section 17(a) of the Act provides generally that it is unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal to knowingly purchase or to sell any security or other property from or to such registered company. 
2. Section 17(b) of the Act provides generally that the Commission may grant an order exempting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. 
3. The Mergers may be subject to the provisions of section 17(a) of the Act because it could be viewed as involving an investment company (ALIC Separate Account A, ALNY VA, ALNY VA II,) selling its assets to another investment company (Allstate Separate Account I, ALNY Separate Account A) that is affiliated by reason of having sponsoring insurance companies that are under common control, or by reason of having common directors. 
4. Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to section 17(b) of the Act to the extent necessary to exempt the Mergers from the provisions of section 17(a) of the Act.
5. Applicants assert that the terms of the Mergers are fair and reasonable. Applicants represent that the transfer of assets held by ALIC Separate Account A will be made at the relative net asset values of the sub-accounts. Consequently, the interests of Allstate Separate Account I owners will not be diluted by the Merger, and each ALIC Separate Account A contract will be credited, immediately after the Merger, with units of Allstate Separate Account I having the same aggregate value as the aggregate value of the units of ALIC Separate Account A credited to such contract immediately prior to the Merger. Likewise, each ALNY VA and ALNY VA II contract will be credited, immediately after the Merger, with units of ALNY Separate Account A having the same aggregate value as the aggregate value of the units of ALNY VA and ALNY VA II credited to such contract immediately prior to the Merger. The Merger will not result in any change in charges, costs, fees or expenses borne by any Contract owner. No direct or indirect costs will be incurred by any Separate Account concerned as a result of the Mergers. Therefore, the proposed transactions will not result in dilution of the economic interests of any Contract owner. In addition, the Mergers will result in no change in the investment options available to Contract owners. Each sub-account of the Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Mergers.
6. The consolidation of any overlapping sub-accounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each Allstate Life or Allstate New York Contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging sub-accounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving sub-account. The values of the exchanged interests under the Contracts will thus be equivalent. The accumulation unit values for these sub-accounts will not change, and the Contract value of any affected Contract owner immediately after the sub-account consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the sub-account consolidation.
7. Applicants assert that the Mergers do not involve overreaching on the part of any party involved and is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. The purposes of the Mergers are to consolidate three variable annuity separate accounts, each of which issue variable annuity contracts, into a single separate account and to consolidate two variable life separate accounts, each of which issue variable life contracts, into a single separate account. The Mergers will allow for administrative efficiencies and cost savings by Allstate Life and Allstate New York because they can consolidate its separate account operations. The Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Allstate Life and Allstate New York contracts, nor will the Mergers affect the values determined under the Allstate Life and Allstate New York contracts.Start Printed Page 16295

8. Applicants represent that the Mergers are consistent with the policy of each Separate Account as set forth in its registration statement. The policy of each Separate Account is to invest in the Funds. As noted above, the Mergers will result in no change to any Fund underlying the Separate Accounts. Each sub-account of the Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Mergers. Accordingly, the assets underlying the Contracts will continue to be invested in accordance with the policies recited in the Separate Accounts' respective registration statements.
Conclusion
For the reasons summarized above, Applicants assert that the terms of the Merger, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, are consistent with the policies of the Allstate Life and Allstate New York Separate Accounts as recited in their registration statements, are consistent with the general purposes of the Act, and therefore meet the conditions for exemptive relief established by section 17(b).

I'm here to answer any questions you may have, but keep these questions in mind when you're choosing liability coverage for your business.Learn More Motorcycle Passenger ProtectionSometimes the best way to enjoy a ride is with a friend on the back of your motorcycle.

13. Each time Glenbrook receives a Purchase Payment from an owner of a Glenbrook Contract, it will add to the owner's contract value a Credit Enhancement. There are two Credit Enhancement options available under the Glenbrook Contract:

Under option 1, Glenbrook will add to the owner's contract value a Credit Enhancement equal to 4% of the Purchase Payment amount.
Under option 2, Glenbrook will add to the owner's contract value a Credit Enhancement equal to 2% of the Purchase Payment amount. In addition, on every 5th contract anniversary during the accumulation phase, Glenbrook will add to the owner's contract value a Credit Enhancement equal to 2% of the owner's contract value as of such contract anniversary.

In addition, assets invested in the Sub-accounts are charged with the annual operating expenses of the Portfolios.
15. Each time Allstate Life receives a Purchase Payment from an owner of an Allstate Life Contract, it will add to the owner's contract value a Credit Enhancement of 4% of the Purchase Payment amount. Allstate Life will allocate Credit Enhancements among the available Portfolios, according to the allocation instructions in effect for the Purchase Payments. Allstate Life will fund Credit Enhancements from its general account assets.
16. The Allstate Life Contract provides for various surrender options, annuity benefits and annuity payout options, as well as transfer privileges among Sub-accounts, dollar cost averaging, and other features. The Contract contains the following charges: (i) A withdrawal charge as a percentage of Purchase Payments surrendered, which is 8% in years one, two, and three, 7% in year four, 6% in year five, 5% in year six, 4% in year seven, 3% in year eight, and 0% thereafter; (ii) a mortality and expense risk fee of 1.60% annually; and (iii) a transfer fee of .50% of the amount transferred on transfers in excess of twelve within a calendar year.

In addition, assets invested in the Sub-accounts are charged with the annual operating expenses of the Portfolios.
17. Each Insurance Company Applicant will recapture Credit Enhancements if the owner returns the Contract for a refund during the free look period. The free look period is 20 days or such longer period as may be required under state law. The Insurance Company Applicants will not seek to recapture Credit Enhancements under any other circumstance.
18. The free look period is the period during which an owner may return a Contract after it has been delivered and receive a full refund of the contract value, less any Credit Enhancements. No other charges will apply to the refund, but the owner bears the investment risk from the time of purchase until he or she returns the Contract. The owner also will bear any expenses charged with respect to the Credit Enhancement amount incurred prior to return of the Contract, e.g., any mortality and expense risk charge. The refund amount may be more or less than the Purchase Payment the owner made, unless state insurance law requires that the full amount of the Purchase Payment be refunded.
19. Applicants seek relief pursuant to Section 6(c) from Sections 2(a)(32) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary (i) to permit Lincoln Benefit, Glenbrook, and Allstate Life to recapture an amount equal to the Credit Enhancements when an owner returns a Contract or Future Contract for a refund during the “free look” period, in which case the issuing Insurance Company Applicant will recover the amount of any Credit Enhancement applicable to such contribution, and (ii) to permit all of the Insurance Company Applicants to recapture Credit Enhancements under Future Contracts Insurance Company Applicants may issue through the Separate Accounts Applicants or through Future Accounts that contain Credit Enhancement features, including recapture provisions, that are substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts. Applicants also request that the order being sought extend to any Affiliated Broker-Dealer that serves as a distributor or principal underwriter for Contracts or Future Start Printed Page 24171Contracts offered through the Separate Account Applicants or any Future Account.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 6(c) the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission to exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Applicants believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
2. Applicants represent that it is not administratively feasible to track the Credit Enhancement amount in the Sub-accounts after the Credit Enhancement is applied. Accordingly, the asset-based charges applicable to the Sub-accounts will be assessed against the entire amounts held in the Sub-accounts, including the Credit Enhancement amount, during the “free look” period. As a result, during such period, the aggregate asset-based charges assessed against an owner's annuity account value will be higher than those that would be charged if the owner's contract value did not include the Credit Enhancements.
3. Subsection (i) of Section 27 provides that Section 27 does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts, or the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account, except as provided in paragraph (2) of the subsection. Paragraph (2) provides that it shall be unlawful for any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or a sponsoring insurance company of such account to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless, among other things, such contract is a redeemable security. Section 2(a)(32) defines “redeemable security” as any security, other than short-term paper, under the terms of which the holder, upon presentation to the issuer, is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent thereof.
4. Applicants submit that the Credit Enhancement recapture provisions of the Contracts would not deprive an owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets. Applicants state that an owner's interest in the Credit Enhancement amount allocated to his or her contract value upon receipt of an initial Purchase Payment is not vested until the applicable free-look period has expired without return of the Contract. Until the free look period has expired and any Credit Enhancement amount is vested, Applicants submit that the issuing Insurance Company Applicant retains the right and interest in the Credit Enhancement amount, although not in the earnings attributable to that amount. Thus, Applicants argue that when an Insurance Company Applicant recaptures any Credit Enhancement, it is merely retrieving its own assets, and the owner has not been deprived of a proportionate share of the Separate Account's assets.
5. In addition, Applicants state that permitting an owner to retain a Credit Enhancement under a contract upon the exercise of the free look period would not only be unfair, but would also encourage individuals to purchase a Contract with no intention of keeping it, but simply to return it for a quick profit.
6. Applicants state that the Credit Enhancement will be attractive to and in the interest of investors because it will permit owners to put either 102% (under Credit Enhancement option 2 of Glenbrook's Contracts) or 104% (under Lincoln's and Allstate Life's Contracts and Credit Enhancement option 1 of Glenbrook's Contract) of their Purchase Payments to work for them in the selected Sub-accounts. In addition, the owner will retain any earnings attributable to the Credit Enhancement, as well as the principal amount of the Credit Enhancement if he or she does not cancel the Contract.
7. Applicants submit that the provisions for recapture of any Credit Enhancement under the Contracts do not, and any such Future Contract provisions will not, violate Section 2(a)(32) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the 1940 Act. Nevertheless, to avoid any uncertainties, Applicants request an exemption from those Sections, to the extent deemed necessary, to permit the recapture of any Credit Enhancements under the circumstances described herein with respect to the Contracts and any Future Contracts, without the loss of the relief from Section 27 provided by Section 27(i).
8. Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of, and dealers in, the redeemable securities of any registered investment company, whether or not members of any securities association, to the same extent, covering the same subject matter, and for the accomplishment of the same ends as are prescribed in Section 22(a). Rule 22c-1 thereunder prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security, a person designated in such issuer's prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security, and a principal underwriter of, or dealer in, such security, from selling, redeeming, or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security.
9. Arguably, the recapture of a Credit Enhancement might be viewed as resulting in the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the Separate Account. Applicants contend, however, that recapture does not involve either of the evils that Rule 22c-1 was intended to eliminate or reduce, namely: (i) The dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or their redemption or repurchase at a price above it, and (ii) other unfair results including speculative trading practices. To effect a recapture of a Credit Enhancement the issuing Insurance Company Applicant will redeem an owner's interest in a Sub-account at a price determined on the basis of current net asset value of the Sub-account. The amount recaptured will equal the amount of the Credit Enhancements paid out of its general account assets. Although the owner will be entitled to retain any investment gain attributable to the Credit Enhancement, the amount of such gain will be determined on the basis of the current net asset value of the relevant Sub-accounts. Thus, no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the Credit Enhancement. Applicants also submit that the second harm that Rule 22c-1 was designed to address, namely, speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing, will not occur as a result of the recapture of the Credit. However, to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the 1940 Act, Applicants request an exemption from the provisions of Rule 22c-1 to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the Credit Enhancements Start Printed Page 24172under the Contracts and Future Contracts.
10. Applicants submit that their request for an order, which applies to Future Accounts established by the Insurance Company Applicants, and Future Contracts that are substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts described herein, is appropriate in the public interest. Applicants state that such an order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications in the future, thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of Applicants' resources. Applicants state that requiring them to file additional Applications would impair their ability effectively to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, and that investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection by requiring Applicants to repeatedly seek exemptive relief that would present no issue under the 1940 Act that has not already been addressed in this Application.
 Conclusion
Applicants submit that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, namely, that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act, and that, therefore, the Commission should grant the requested order.

                                 the amount and timing of withdrawals. Required minimum distributions as calculated by us will not  
                                 reduce future Annual Income Amounts (or Annual Withdrawal Amounts for TrueIncome only). However,   
                                 for TrueIncome they will result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the Protected Withdrawal       
                                 Value and may reduce the duration the annual Withdrawal Amount may be received. Please contact     
                                 your tax advisor before purchasing the benefit so you can determine the potential impact of        
                                 required minimum distribution on your plan.

Allstate Life Insurance Company: No-Action Letter dated December 23, 2002
















Home | Previous Page






























No-Action Letter under
Securities Act of 1933 - Sections 5 and 8
Allstate Life Insurance Company
December 23, 2002
Reponse of the Office of Insurance Products
Division of Investment Management
Allstate Life Insurance Company, et al.
Based on the facts and representations in your letter dated December 23, 2002 and in an application for an exemptive order under Sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate"), Northbrook Life Insurance Company ("Northbrook") or Morgan Stanley DW Inc. under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act,"), if the Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A (the "Northbrook Life Separate Account") is transferred to Allstate, where it will change its name to Allstate Life Separate Account A, in connection with the proposed merger of Northbrook into Allstate (the "Merger").  We also would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, or Section 11 of the 1940 Act, if the Northbrook Variable Annuity Account and Northbrook Variable Annuity Account II (the "Northbrook VA Accounts") are merged with Allstate Financial Advisors Separate Account I ("Allstate Separate Account I") (the "Separate Account Mergers") in connection with the Merger.  In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if (1) the change in depositor of the Northbrook Life Separate Account as a result of the Merger is effected though the filing of an amendment to the registration statement for the Northbrook Life Separate Account under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements under the 1933 Act are filed by Allstate, the Northbrook Life Separate Account and Allstate Separate Account I to cover any securities issued after the Merger in connection with variable life insurance contracts funded by the Northbrook Life Separate Account and any variable annuity contracts funded by Allstate Separate Account I.
Further, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, without registration under the 1933 Act, Northbrook transfers to Allstate assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under certain fixed annuity contracts with market value adjustment features, as a result of which Allstate would assume all of the obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under such contracts.
In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, after consummation of the Merger, Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Separate Account A (formerly Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A), and the other parties named in the exemptive orders cited in your letter, continue to rely on such orders without filing amended or new applications for the same relief previously granted.
Because our position is based on facts and representations in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion. Further, this response expresses the position of the Division on enforcement only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusions on the issues presented.

Securities and Exchange Commission
450 Fifth Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20549-0506
Re:  Allstate Life Insurance Company,
Northbrook Life Insurance Company, and
Morgan Stanley DW Inc.
Dear Mr. Kotapish: 
We are writing on behalf of Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate"), Northbrook Life Insurance Company ("Northbrook"), and Morgan Stanley DW Inc. ("MSDW") to request that the staff advise us that it would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in connection with the merger of Northbrook into its parent, Allstate (the "Merger"), described below.  This letter replaces our letter to you of August 30, 2002, and reflects changes agreed upon with the Commission staff.
Specifically, Allstate, Northbrook, and MSDW are seeking the staff's assurances that it would not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action:
under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), if Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A ("Northbrook Life Separate Account") is transferred intact to Allstate, as described below (the "Separate Account Transfer"); 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder or Section 11 of the 1940 Act if Northbrook Variable Annuity Account ("Northbrook VA") and Northbrook Variable Annuity Account II ("Northbrook VA II," together with Northbrook VA, the "Northbrook VA Accounts") merge with Allstate Financial Advisors Separate Account I ("Allstate Separate Account I") and consolidate any duplicative sub-accounts ("consolidated sub-accounts"), as described below (the "Separate Account Mergers"); 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts (the "Northbrook MVA Contracts"),  Northbrook transfers to Allstate assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts, and Allstate assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under such Contracts, as described below (the "Fixed Account Transfer"); and  
after consummation of the Merger, if Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, and certain others described herein continue to rely on the exemptive orders identified herein obtained on behalf of Northbrook, the Northbrook  Separate Accounts, and any other parties named therein without the filing or submission of amended or new applications for the same exemptive relief.
The Merger, Separate Account Transfer, Separate Account Mergers, and Fixed Account Transfer comprise the "Proposed Transactions," as referred to herein. 
I. Facts
Representatives of the companies involved have advised us of the facts set out below.
A. Allstate
Allstate is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Illinois in 1957.  Allstate's home office is located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Allstate is licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York.  Allstate currently has two registered separate accounts one of which, as described  below, will be involved in the Proposed Transactions.  At December 31, 2001, Allstate had approximately $44 billion in general and separate account assets on a statutory basis. 
Allstate is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Insurance Company, a stock property-liability insurance company incorporated under the laws of Illinois. All of the outstanding capital stock of Allstate Insurance Company is owned by The Allstate Corporation. 
Allstate is the depositor of Allstate Separate Account I.
B. Northbrook
Northbrook is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Arizona in 1998.  Previously, from 1978 to 1998, Northbrook was organized under the laws of the State of Illinois. Northbrook's headquarters are located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Northbrook is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate.  Northbrook is currently licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York.  Northbrook currently has four registered separate accounts that are described below. At December 31, 2001, Northbrook had approximately $6.4 billion in general and separate account assets on a statutory basis.  
Northbrook and Allstate entered into a reinsurance agreement effective December 31, 1987. Under the reinsurance agreement, Allstate reinsures all of Northbrook's liabilities under its annuity and life insurance contracts.
Northbrook is the depositor of the Northbrook VA Accounts and the Northbrook Life Separate Account.
C. Separate Accounts and Contracts
Allstate Separate Account I was created pursuant to Illinois law and is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.1 Units of interest in Allstate Separate Account I are registered under the 1933 Act.2  Allstate Separate Account I funds two Allstate variable annuity contracts ("Allstate Contracts"). The Allstate Contracts are currently offered for sale in all states where Allstate is licensed. 
The Northbrook VA Accounts and the Northbrook Life Separate Account (collectively, the "Northbrook Separate Accounts") were created under Arizona law and each is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.3   The Northbrook VA Accounts fund six variable annuity contracts ("Northbrook VA Contracts"), and Northbrook Life Separate Account funds one variable life insurance contract ("Northbrook VLI Contract," and, together with the Northbrook VA Contracts and the Northbrook MVA Contracts, the "Northbrook Contracts"). Units of interest in each Northbrook Separate Account are registered under the 1933 Act.4 
All of the Northbrook Contracts are currently offered for sale in all states where Northbrook is licensed, with the exception of the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity, the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity II, and the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity II AssetManager.5   The Northbrook VA and VLI Contracts generally permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.
The above separate accounts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a portfolio of an open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act (each, an "Underlying Fund," collectively, the "Underlying Funds").  Currently, Allstate Separate Account I consists of 59 sub-accounts, Northbrook Life Separate Account consists of 20 sub-accounts, Northbrook VA consists of 11 sub-accounts, and Northbrook VA II consists of 53 sub-accounts. Several of the sub-accounts available under the Northbrook VA Contracts and the Allstate Contracts invest in the same Underlying Funds; however, those sub-accounts each have different accumulation unit values due to the different charges imposed under those Contracts.  Each of the Allstate Contracts and Northbrook Contracts also offer one or more general account options that are not registered under the 1933 Act. 
D. Northbrook MVA Contracts
The Northbrook MVA Contracts are flexible premium deferred fixed annuity contracts that are offered to individuals and to eligible groups. They have no variable investment options.  Northbrook holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Northbrook MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account that is not registered under the 1940 Act.  Market value adjustment interests in the Northbrook MVA Contracts are registered under the 1933 Act.6
E. Underwriter 
MSDW, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., is the principal underwriter for the Northbrook Contracts.  MSDW was organized under the laws of Delaware in 1968.  MSDW is registered with the Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
II. The Proposed Transactions
A. The Merger
Northbrook will merge with and into Allstate, with Allstate as the surviving corporation, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Articles of Merger (collectively, the "Merger Agreement") approved by the Boards of Directors of Allstate and Northbrook.  The Merger is subject to approval by the insurance departments of Arizona and Illinois, the states of domicile for Northbrook and Allstate, respectively.  Allstate and Northbrook expect to consummate the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, and the Fixed Account Transfer, on or about January 1, 2003 (the "Effective Date").
As a result of the Merger, Allstate will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of the Northbrook Separate Accounts and will become directly liable for Northbrook's liabilities and obligations with respect to the Northbrook Contracts then outstanding.7  Each Northbrook Contract owner will become a contract owner of Allstate by operation of law.  The Merger will not affect the provisions of, or the rights and obligations under, the Northbrook Contracts. Moreover, the Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Northbrook Contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Northbrook Contracts.  The Merger will not affect any current Allstate Contract owners.
No charges will be imposed on, or other deductions made from, the Northbrook Separate Accounts or Allstate Separate Account I in connection with the Merger.  In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Northbrook Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed.8
No new investment options will be made available to owners of the Northbrook Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger, nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated. Each sub-account of the Northbrook Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Underlying Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger. 
The Merger will not directly affect any of the Underlying Funds. The Underlying Funds will not be a party to the Merger or any related transaction. The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of the Underlying Funds will not be changed as a result of the Merger or any related transaction.   No investment portfolios are proposed to be added to, substituted by, or terminated by the Underlying Funds in connection with the Merger or any related transaction.  Moreover, the Merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the Underlying Funds, the Underlying Funds' assets, or the charges imposed on the Underlying Funds or their shareholders.  In addition, the Merger will not result in a change in the principal underwriter for the Northbrook Contracts. 
Allstate and Northbrook have determined that no provision of the Northbrook Contracts or state law provides the owners of those Contracts ("Northbrook Contract owners") with any right to opt-out of, or to vote on or otherwise consent to, the Merger. Rather, the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies.  Moreover, none of the events affecting the Northbrook Separate Accounts in connection with the Merger require a vote of Northbrook Contract owners under the 1940 Act. In addition, as described above, the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the Northbrook Contracts will not change, except that Allstate will become the depositor of the Northbrook Separate Accounts. Consequently, Northbrook Contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the Merger.   
After the Merger, Allstate intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Northbrook Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Northbrook Contracts currently being offered, but for the change in depositor.  Allstate will administer the Northbrook Contracts in the same manner as did Northbrook immediately prior to the Merger. 
All costs of the Merger will be borne by Allstate or an affiliate and not by any owners of Northbrook or Allstate Contracts (each, a "Contract owner," and collectively, the "Contract owners"). 
B. The Separate Account Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Northbrook Life Separate Account will transfer intact to Allstate and become part of Allstate on the Effective Date.  It will change its name to Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and have Allstate as its depositor rather than Northbrook. No other changes to Northbrook Life Separate Account will result from the Merger.  
The assets and liabilities that comprise Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately prior to the Merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of Allstate, as the surviving company, after the Merger.  In addition, Northbrook Life Separate Account will continue to fund the same Contracts it did immediately prior to the Merger. 
C. The Separate Account Mergers
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Northbrook VA Accounts will merge with Allstate Separate Account I on the Effective Date.  To achieve administrative efficiencies and cost savings, Allstate will consolidate any duplicative sub-accounts that invest in the same Underlying Fund. 
The consolidation of the sub-accounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each Northbrook Contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging sub-accounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving sub-account.9   The values of the exchanged interests under the Contracts will thus be equivalent.  The accumulation unit values for these sub-accounts will not change, and the Contract value of any affected Contract owner immediately after the sub-account consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the sub-account consolidation. 
The Separate Account Mergers will not affect the sub-accounts of the Northbrook Separate Accounts that are not duplicative.  Those sub-accounts will remain intact within Allstate Separate Account I and their net asset values immediately after the Merger will be the same as they were immediately before the Merger.  
D. The Fixed Account Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Northbrook will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts to Allstate, and Allstate will assume Northbrook's obligations under such Contracts, on the Effective Date. As a result of the Merger,  each non-unitized separate account of Northbrook that funds the Northbrook MVA Contracts will become a non-unitized separate account of Allstate. At the same time, Allstate will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of Northbrook and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of Northbrook under the Northbrook MVA Contracts issued prior to the Merger. 
The Fixed Account Transfer will not change the terms of the Northbrook MVA Contracts, except for the succession of Allstate as the insurer under the Northbrook MVA Contracts, and it will not adversely affect the values determined under, or the economic interests of the owners of, those Contracts. 
E. Procedural Matters
Allstate will file new registration statements on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, under the 1933 Act to reflect the change in depositor of the Northbrook Separate Accounts and Allstate's assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Northbrook under the Northbrook VA Contracts and Northbrook VLI Contract. Allstate will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  Existing Northbrook Contract owners (other than Northbrook VLI Contract owners) will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects Allstate's sponsorship of the Northbrook Separate Accounts as a result of the Merger.  New Contract owners will receive a revised prospectus that reflects the change in depositor.  Northbrook VLI Contract owners will receive a new Form N-6 prospectus that reflects the change in depositor.
Allstate also will file new registration statements on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act for the Northbrook MVA Contracts.  Allstate will seek to have the registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date. These new registration statements would reflect Allstate's assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Northbrook with respect to the Northbrook MVA Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Each person who owns a Northbrook MVA Contract at the time of the Fixed Account Transfer will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects Allstate as the issuer of the Contract.  New Contract owners will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer.
In compliance with applicable state law, Allstate, and Northbrook will notify the owners of the Northbrook Contracts that Allstate has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under those Contracts.
Following the Effective Date, Allstate will not make offers or accept purchase payments under the Northbrook Contracts until the new registration statements filed with the Commission are effective.
III. Discussion
For the reasons discussed below, we are of the view that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder do not apply to the Proposed Transactions.  We also are of the view, as discussed below, that Section 8 of the 1940 Act does not apply to the Separate Account Transfer, and that Section 11 of the 1940 Act does not apply to the Separate Account Transfer or the Separate Account Mergers.  Finally, we are of the view that the exemptive relief previously granted to Northbrook and other named parties prior to the Merger10 may continue to be relied upon after the Merger by Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and the other named parties without the need for the filing or submission of amended or duplicative exemptive applications. 
The staff has responded favorably to no-action requests dealing with the provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act noted above regarding transactions similar to the Separate Account Transfer,11 the Separate Account Mergers,12  and the Fixed Account Transfer.13 We respectfully submit that the Proposed Transactions are analogous to and pose no different issues than those presented in the transactions described in those no-action requests.
A. Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder Do Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, or the Fixed Account Transfer
1. Separate Account Transfer
In our view, the Separate Account Transfer would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder.   
The Separate Account Transfer would not change the Northbrook VLI Contracts, except that, by operation of law, Allstate would succeed Northbrook as the depositor of Northbrook Life Separate Account and co-issuer of the Contracts and would, accordingly, guarantee the rights and benefits provided by the Contracts.14 These rights and benefits (e.g., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) would remain the same but would be guaranteed directly by Allstate's larger pool of assets. Cash values under the Northbrook VLI Contracts that are allocated to the Northbrook Life Separate Account would remain funded by the same pool of assets that presently constitutes the Separate Account, and its sub-accounts would continue to invest in the same Underlying Funds.  The unit values under the Northbrook VLI Contracts offered by Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A immediately after the Separate Account Transfer would be the same as under the Contracts offered by Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately before. The Separate Account Transfer, therefore, would not affect those aspects of the Northbrook VLI Contracts that cause interests thereunder to be treated as securities, e.g., the investment options available through the Separate Account.
The Separate Account Transfer would have no effect on the Northbrook Life Separate Account, except for the succession of Allstate as depositor and co-issuer described above, and except for the change in name of that Separate Account to Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A. The assets and liabilities that comprise the Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately before the Separate Account Transfer would remain intact and legally segregated from all other business of Allstate.   The financial history of the Northbrook Life Separate Account would be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Allstate, would not change. 
As discussed above, Contract owners will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, and will not, by virtue of the Merger, have available any new or different investment options. Consequently, Contract Owners will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Separate Account Transfer.  
Based on the foregoing, we believe that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 14515 thereunder do not apply to the Separate Account Transfer. 
2. Separate Account Mergers
In our view, the Separate Account Mergers would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder.   
The Separate Account Mergers would not result in any change to the Northbrook VA Contracts, except that Allstate would succeed Northbrook as depositor and as co-issuer of the Contracts. The rights and benefits under the Northbrook VA Contracts would remain the same, all of the sub-accounts of the Northbrook VA Accounts would continue to invest in the same Underlying Funds, the Northbrook VA Contract values immediately following the Merger will be the same as immediately before, and Contract owners would not be asked to make a new investment decision, since their vote or consent is not required in connection with the Merger. 
The change in depositor following the Merger does not change the nature of the securities outstanding.  The identity of the depositor is relevant to investors primarily because the depositor makes guarantees that are in the nature of insurance obligations. For example, the depositor, in effect, guarantees to make up any shortfall in separate account assets to pay any death benefit, notwithstanding that the benefit might be greater than the amount of account value supporting the contract in question, and to make annuity payments for whatever period is contractually required, regardless of whether the relevant contract's account value has already been depleted thereby.  We respectfully submit, therefore, that the difference in depositors is a difference that relates almost exclusively to the insurance guarantees under the Northbrook Contracts, rather than to those aspects of the Contracts that constitute (or cause the Contracts to be) securities. This argues strongly against the conclusion that the existence of a different depositor necessarily gives rise to a different security.  
Moreover, even if the Separate Account Mergers were deemed to involve the issuance of  new or different securities, such issuance would not be registrable under the terms of Section 5 or Rule 145, because Contract owners do not have any discretion about whether or not to participate in the Separate Account Mergers.  Accordingly, the Contract owners will not be called upon to make the kind of investment decision that historically has been deemed necessary for an "offer" or "sale" to occur that would bring Section 5 into play.  Nor, in this case, will there be the kind of security holder action that, under the terms of the rule, is required to bring Rule 145 into play.
3. Fixed Account Transfer 
In our view, the Fixed Account Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act.
No change will be made to the Northbrook MVA Contracts by virtue of the Fixed Account Transfer, except that Allstate will succeed Northbrook as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the Northbrook MVA Contracts. These rights and benefits (i.e., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) will remain the same.  Northbrook will transfer its non-unitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts intact to Allstate. Consequently, when the Fixed Account Transfer becomes effective, Allstate will hold these assets in the same non-unitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer.
As discussed above, owners of Northbrook MVA Contracts will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Fixed Account Transfer and will not, by virtue of the Fixed Account Transfer, have available any new or different investment options. Consequently, owners of Northbrook MVA Contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Fixed Account Transfer.
B. Section 8 of the 1940 Act Does Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer
In our view, the succession of Allstate to the position of depositor for the Northbrook Life Separate Account as a result of the Merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act.   
The Merger will cause a change in the depositor of the Northbrook Life Separate Account, which will involve a change in the co-issuer of the units of interest under variable life insurance contracts funded through that Separate Account.  However, the change in depositor will not change the structure or operation of the Northbrook Life Separate Account or its relationship to the insurance company issuing the Northbrook VLI Contracts or to the Contract owners.  The Northbrook Life Separate Account would continue to be treated as a separate entity for all relevant purposes, including financial reporting.  
The Commission's "ectoplasmic" theory,16 in our view, supports the position that Northbrook Life Separate Account, as such, will have a continuing, uninterrupted existence, notwithstanding the change of the insurance company serving as its depositor and having legal ownership of its assets. Although the assets of Northbrook Life Separate Account will become assets of Allstate, such assets will remain intact in a legally separate account, and, for financial reporting purposes, the Separate Account will be treated as a continuing separate entity. 
Accordingly, to reflect the change in legal ownership of the assets of the Northbrook Life Separate Account from Northbrook to Allstate following the consummation of the Merger, Allstate and the Separate Account will file a new registration statement on Form N-6 that will constitute an amendment to the Separate Account's existing registration under the 1940 Act.  The Form N-6 registration statement also will register, under the 1933 Act, any securities transactions effected under the Northbrook VLI  Contracts after the Merger.  Allstate will file the Form N-6 registration statement to ensure that it will become effective on or about the effective date of the Merger. 
C. Section 11 of the 1940 Act Does Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer and the Separate Account Mergers
Based on the foregoing analysis, we also believe that the Separate Account Transfer does not involve an exchange of securities (the separate account interests in the Northbrook VLI Contracts) issued by an investment company (the Northbrook VLI Separate Account) for securities of any other investment company for purposes of Section 11 of the 1940 Act.   In addition, for the reasons discussed above, we believe that the Separate Account Mergers do not involve an "offer of exchange" within the meaning of Section 11.   However, should the Separate Account Transfer or the Separate Account Mergers be viewed as including an offer of exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of Section 11, we believe that such transactions would comply with the requirements of Section 11(a) and Rule 11a-2(b)(2) thereunder, because any such exchange would be effected at relative net asset values. Thus, Commission approval of such transactions should not be required under Section 11 of the 1940 Act. 
D. Continued Reliance on Prior Exemptive Relief Is Appropriate
We believe the exemptions under the 1940 Act17 that Northbrook, the Northbrook Separate Accounts, and the other parties named therein have received from the Commission or its staff should continue to apply after the Merger to Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and other parties named therein, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, without the filing with the Commission of amended or duplicative applications for the same relief.  Their continued applicability is appropriate because the Merger will not change the operations of Allstate Separate Account I, nor its relationship to its depositor, any other separate account, or Contract owners.  The only changes  resulting from the Merger are: (i) the substitution of Allstate for Northbrook as depositor for the Northbrook Separate Accounts and as co-issuer and insurer of the Northbrook Contracts, (ii) the transfer of the sub-accounts of the Northbrook Separate Accounts to Allstate Separate Account I, (iii) the transfer of Northbrook Life Separate Account to Allstate, and (iv) the consolidation of the transferred sub-accounts that invest in the same Underlying Funds.  It is our view that such changes have no impact upon, and are not relevant to, the exemptions that were previously granted or the justifications for those exemptions.  In support of our view, we note that the Commission staff has taken a favorable position on similar requests in several no-action letters.18
IV. No-Action Request
Based upon the above facts and circumstances, we respectfully request that the Commission staff issue a letter stating that it will not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder in connection with the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, and the Fixed Account Transfer, or under Section 8 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Separate Account Transfer, and Section 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Separate Account Transfer and the Separate Account Mergers.
In addition, we request that the staff advise us that the exemptive orders cited herein, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, will continue to be applicable after the Effective Date, in the manner described above, to Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and to the parties named therein without the filing of amended or duplicative applications for the same exemptions for the same assurance.
If you have any questions or require further information with respect to this matter, please call me, Chip Lunde (202-295-4016), or Charles Smith of Allstate (847-402-1790).
Very truly yours,
/s/ Richard T. Choi

14  Some state insurance departments will require an endorsement to outstanding policies to reflect the change of issuer. 
15   Rule 145 under the 1933 Act provides, in pertinent part, that certain business combinations, including certain mergers, consolidations, and transfers of assets, will be deemed to involve the "offer" or "sale" of securities requiring registration under the Act under circumstances where existing security holders are in effect asked to make an investment decision whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for a security they presently own. Even if the Merger were deemed to be a "transfer of assets" for purposes of Rule 145, it is clear that the Rule does not apply because the Contract owners are not being asked to vote on or to consent to the transaction. For these reasons, we believe that Rule 145 is inapplicable to the Merger.

The corporate spokesperson is Dennis Haysbert.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate also sponsors branded nets during field goals and extra points at over 20 college bowl games, including the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the BCS National Championship Game.
Additionally, Allstate is a partner of the Southeastern Conference and its 20 sports, including football.[24]

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

The Allstate Corporation is the second largest personal lines insurer in the United States (behind State Farm) and the largest that is publicly held. The company also has personal lines insurance operations in Canada. Allstate was founded in 1931 as part of Sears, Roebuck and Co., and was spun off in 1993.[4] The company has had its headquarters in Northfield Township, Illinois, near Northbrook since 1967.[5][6] Its current advertising campaign, in use since 2004, asks, "Are you in good hands?" The corporate spokesperson is Dennis Haysbert.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".
