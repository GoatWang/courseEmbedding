Pacira Pharmaceuticals Appoints Charles A. Reinhart, III, As Chief Financial Officer






GlobeNewswire



Apr 19, 2016 8:00 AM EDT













 


















































 "I am pleased to join Pacira during this period of investment and growth, and look forward to leading the talented Finance team that Jim Scibetta has already assembled here," said Mr. Reinhart. "By providing an effective non-opioid option like EXPAREL for the treatment of postsurgical pain, Pacira has been able to demonstrate improved patient outcomes and lower overall costs to the healthcare system. I am excited to build upon the success of this product, as well as the company's future opportunities, in my shared commitment with Pacira to enhance the patient experience and drive shareholder value."   About Pacira                                                                            Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCRX) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the clinical and commercial development of new products that meet the needs of acute care practitioners and their patients. The company's flagship product, EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia, was commercially launched in the United States in April 2012. EXPAREL and two other products have successfully utilized DepoFoam®, a unique and proprietary product delivery technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure, and releases them over a desired period of time. Additional information about Pacira is available at www.pacira.com.  About EXPAREL® EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is currently indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. The product combines bupivacaine with DepoFoam®, a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period. EXPAREL represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri- or postsurgical setting. By utilizing the DepoFoam platform, a single dose of EXPAREL delivers bupivacaine over time, providing significant reductions in cumulative pain score with up to a 45 percent decrease in opioid consumption; the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated. Additional information is available at www.EXPAREL.com.     Forward Looking Statements   Any statements in this press release about our future expectations, plans, outlook and prospects, and other statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may" and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release.

PARSIPPANY, N.J., April  19, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCRX) today announced the appointment of Charles A. Reinhart, III, to the position of Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Reinhart will be responsible for overseeing all financial and capital market activities at Pacira, including accounting, financial reporting, financial planning and analysis and investor relations. In this position, he will succeed former Chief Financial Officer Jim Scibetta, who is currently President, and will report to Dave Stack, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Mr. Reinhart will start in this new role effective Tuesday, May 3, 2016. “We are excited to welcome another key member to our leadership team in order to properly resource our growing Pacira brand,” said Mr. Stack. “Charlie brings valuable experience from working at commercial stage biotech and specialty pharmaceutical companies, succeeding in roles that both meet and exceed traditional CFO responsibilities—the type of strategic background and expertise that will help support the successful expansion of EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) and pipeline opportunities.” Prior to joining Pacira, Mr. Reinhart served as Chief Financial Officer of Covis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Archimedes Pharma Ltd and PharmAthene, Inc. He has also held senior financial roles at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cephalon, Inc. and several early stage life sciences companies. Mr. Reinhart has successfully built and managed finance organizations within rapidly growing companies, responsible for accounting and financial reporting, financial planning and analysis, tax, treasury, risk management and procurement. He has worked closely with commercial teams to evaluate sales operations, monitor product pricing and implement contracting strategies. In addition, he has significant experience in investor relations, corporate development and capital raising. He has been integrally involved in equity and debt financing transactions, as well as the evaluation, acquisition and integration of multiple products and companies. Mr. Reinhart earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Lehigh University and his MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is also a CPA. “I am pleased to join Pacira during this period of investment and growth, and look forward to leading the talented Finance team that Jim Scibetta has already assembled here,” said Mr. Reinhart. “By providing an effective non-opioid option like EXPAREL for the treatment of postsurgical pain, Pacira has been able to demonstrate improved patient outcomes and lower overall costs to the healthcare system. I am excited to build upon the success of this product, as well as the company’s future opportunities, in my shared commitment with Pacira to enhance the patient experience and drive shareholder value.” About Pacira                                                                            Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCRX) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the clinical and commercial development of new products that meet the needs of acute care practitioners and their patients. The company’s flagship product, EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia, was commercially launched in the United States in April 2012. EXPAREL and two other products have successfully utilized DepoFoam®, a unique and proprietary product delivery technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure, and releases them over a desired period of time. Additional information about Pacira is available at www.pacira.com. About EXPAREL® EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is currently indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. The product combines bupivacaine with DepoFoam®, a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period. EXPAREL represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri- or postsurgical setting. By utilizing the DepoFoam platform, a single dose of EXPAREL delivers bupivacaine over time, providing significant reductions in cumulative pain score with up to a 45 percent decrease in opioid consumption; the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated.
