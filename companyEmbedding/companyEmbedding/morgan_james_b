Bio

"A phenomenal talent whose feel for classic soul music is bone deep...This woman is on fire." -- The New York Times

One voice is all it takes. The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether.  A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities.  That holds true for New York-based soul singer, songwriter, and Broadway chanteuse Morgan James. 

Her latest studio album is her first as an independent artist, and "Reckless Abandon" is her most personal outing yet.  Morgan assumed co-writing duties on all twelve tracks and sang all her own background vocals.  The album is stocked with lush horns and harmonies, and stretches limbs between genres for a sound all its own.  From the Rufus inspired soul swagger of the opening track "Up In Smoke", to the delicious  R&B slow jam "You Thought Not", to the infectious soulful pop of "Unworthy", MJ takes the listener into her new era of freedom and empowerment. 

On her full-length debut for Epic Records, “Hunter,” she cast an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice, theatrical swing, and a soulful poise. “Hunter” boasts a powerful and personal rendition of Prince’s “Call My Name” (reached Top 15 at Urban AC radio and #1 most added).  Morgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection’s eleven tracks and performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies.   From the empowering farewell of “Fed Up On You” to the mournful rumination of “Say The Words”, or the soulful duet with Grammy Award winner Robert Glasper, "Let Me Keep You", she continually bares it all—both emotionally and musically.
 
In addition to "Reckless Abandon" and "Hunter", Morgan has released a live tribute to Nina Simone, "Morgan James Live" (Epic Records), as well as an EP featuring some of her fan's favorite covers, "YouTube Sessions".  She also recorded a tribute to Joni Mitchell's seminal "Blue", which can be found on iTunes and YouTube. (She can also be heard on countless theatre and concept soundtracks).  Morgan is proud to note that no vocal tuning of any kind has been used on any of her albums.

Morgan’s music videos have accumulated more than 80 million views (and climbing). With viral sensation Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox, Morgan toured the US, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  She is currently on the road touring with her band!

Thank you for visiting and supporting Morgan James and her music. Stay tuned for new music, videos and tour dates :)

 Hunter CD music Product Description

The sophomore album from Morgan James, 2014's Hunter, features the Broadway vocalist's mix of retro-R&B and '70s-influenced singer/songwriter soul. Ostensibly James' debut album, Hunter actually follows up her 2012 Nina Simone tribute concert recording, Morgan James Live from Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola. That said, Hunter is James' first recording of all-original material and, in that sense, a much more personal statement than her live debut. Produced by jazz and bluegrass guitarist Doug Wamble, Hunter finds James delving deeply into a collection of tunes that, while not show tunes in any sense, still make clever use of her stage-honed chops. It also doesn't hurt that Wamble, an experienced musician with a wealth of musical skill and cross-genre knowledge, has assembled a backing band that features a bevy of heavyweight jazz artists, including acclaimed pianist Robert Glasper, saxophonist Ron Blake, trumpeter Ravi Best, and others. However, rather than having James focus on jazz standards or even jazz-influenced pop songs, Wamble helped the vocalist craft an R&B-inflected album that brings to mind classic artists like Carole King and Hall & Oates as well as more contemporary singers including Beyonc� and the late Amy Winehouse. James, who made her Broadway debut in 2010 alongside Nathan Lane in The Addams Family, has a big, resonant voice with a ton of flexibility, perfectly suited for such crisp, soulful cuts as "Heart Shake" and "Bring Yourself to Me." Elsewhere, she delves into several equally compelling bluesy midtempo numbers, including "You Never Lied" and "Drown." Ultimately, it's that voice -- matched with Wamble's superb musical vision -- that creates the soulful, exuberant vibe of Hunter. ~ Matt CollarPersonnel: Morgan James (vocals, background vocals).

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREThe Toyota Product Development System: Integrating People, Process And Technologyby Morgan, James M./ Liker, Jeffrey K.The ability to bring new and innovative products to market rapidly is the prime critical competence for any successful consumer-driven company. All industries, especially automotive, are slashing product development lead times in the current hyper-competitive marketplace. This book is the first to thoroughly examine and analyze the truly effective product development methodology that has made Toyota the most forward-thinking company in the automotive industry. Winner of the 2007 Shingo Prize For Excellence In Manufacturing Research! In The Toyota Product Development System: Integrating People, Process, and Technology, James Morgan and Jeffrey Liker compare and contrast the world-class product development process of Toyota with that of a U.S. competitor. They use extensive examples from Toyota and the U.S. competitor to demonstrate value stream mapping as an extraordinarily powerful tool for continuous improvement. Through examples and case studies, this book illustrates specific techniques and proven practices for dealing with challenges associated with product development, such as synchronizing multiple disciplines, multiple function workload leveling, compound process variation, effective technology integration, and knowledge management. Readers of this book can focus on optimizing the entire product development value stream rather than focus on a specific tool or technology for local improvements.Office Automation, Production & Operations ManagementCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

                                By Ashlyn Kane, Morgan James












Gabe Martin has a simple life plan: get into the NHL and win the Stanley Cup. It doesn’t include being the first out hockey player or, worse, getting involved with one of his teammates. But things change.
Dante Baltierra is Gabe’s polar opposite—careless, reckless… shameless. But his dedication to the sport is impressive, and Gabe can overlook a lot of young-and-stupid in the name of great hockey. And Dante has a superlative ass in a sport filled with superlative asses.
Before Gabe can figure out how to deal, a tabloid throws him out of his comfortable closet into a brand-new world. Amid the emotional turmoil of invasive questions, nasty speculation, and on- and off-ice homophobia, his game suffers.
Surprisingly, it’s Dante who drags him out of it—and then drags him into something else. Nothing good can come of secretly sleeping with a teammate, especially one Gabe has feelings for. But with their captain out with an injury, a rookie in perpetual need of a hug, and the race to make the playoffs for the first time since 1995, Gabe has a lot on his plate.
He can’t be blamed for forgetting that nothing stays secret forever.

Review of Winging It




			By Rosa Hamalainen  on  Feb 26, 2015 10:02



			Ashlyn Kane and Morgan James are probably my favorite writing duo. Their stuff is honestly some of the best I've read out of everything I've read in the genre, from Dreamspinner and other publishers. Their stories are real, with relatable characters and storylines that, especially in the case of Winging It, offer more than just romance and the warm and fuzzies. I actually learned more about hockey than I'd ever cared to know but in a highly entertaining way. So props for making me care about team sports! I had a blast!
