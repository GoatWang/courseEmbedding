We are registering a total of 1,260,000 shares of our common stock for sale by
selling shareholders. No shares are being registered for sale by the Company.
The Company will not receive funds from the sale of shares being offered by
selling shareholders.


Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing
resources than do we. There are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the
marketplace will be successful.
---

Many of the companies with which we will be competing are not public companies. 
The companies’ responsibility to file reports with the SEC upon effectiveness of
this registration statement means our basic operating expenses are much higher
than those of our competitors. The added expense of being a public reporting
company will make it more difficult for us to compete.
