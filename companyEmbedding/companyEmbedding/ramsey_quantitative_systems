Our Products



SmallCap Hedged Equity Small Cap US Equities represent one of the most compelling asset classes available to investors. The combination of a large universe with low analyst coverage and many disparate sources of information makes it a perfect opportunity set for a systematic approach.
 By taking a quantitative approach to fundamental investing, we seek to build a diversified portfolio of small cap companies that offer the greatest opportunity if alpha within a risk-balanced framework. We then hedge this portfolio with a daily-adjusted tactical futures system that’s designed to dynamically identify and respond to deteriorating macro environments.
The result is quality exposure to US Small Cap Equities with protection when you need it.Read MoreGAA Systematic Global Macro Program  The RQSI GAA Systematic Global Macro Program (“GAA”) is a purely systematic, global futures strategy designed to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns with little or no correlation to traditional asset classes. RQSI’s GAA program is easy to understand. At its core, this program seeks to take advantage of multiple levels of diversification by leveraging a deep understanding how markets and sectors interrelate and the optimal frequencies of basic market anomalies.
 We focus on diversification across:

Asset Class
Style
Timeframe

This strategy represents a fusion of our expertise and experience into a single investment
 product that combines a strong econometric based asset allocation process to proven quantitative and technical
 inputs.Read MoreCustom Solutions RQSI’s Custom Solutions represent the building blocks of our GAA portfolio.
 By decomposing GAA into its individual return drivers, we make available to clients the ability to create a custom portfolio solution tailored to their specific risk profile.Read MoreSystematic Yield Systematic yield utilizes multiple Yield sources for capturing non-correlated implicit and explicit yield across asset classes. Allocations to the various yield sources are managed to ensure no single source contributes disproportionally to the total portfolio risk, then a macro hedge is overlaid to protect against extended drawdowns. The result is a diversified source of yield-like income that is less susceptible to (rising-rate) market environments and business cycle fluctuations.
Risk is managed both within the portfolio (to ensure diversification across sources of return) as well as at the macro-level to protect against broad market selloffs.Read More

RQSI Small Cap Hedged Equity Fund
                    (Ticker: RQSIX)
                    

Invest in Quality
The RQSI Hedged Small Cap Equity Fund (the "Fund") is a long-term portfolio designed to provide dynamic exposure to “Quality” US Small Cap companies.
RQSI has been engaged in developing investment strategies based on quantitative and fundamental trading factors for over 20 years.  The Fund represents a fusion of our expertise and experience into a single investment product that combines a strong economic intuition with proven quantitative methods.
The Fund leverages various sources of data to harvest alpha across the “Quality” spectrum.  We define “Quality” on the basis of quantitative, qualitative and statistical factors that our research has shown demonstrate a higher expected return profile with structurally lower volatility than traditional small cap indices:


The Fund also recognizes that there are market environments during which it is not prudent to have full equity exposure.  As a result, a daily hedge offers the ability to mitigate downside loss during market drawdowns.  Components of the Hedge model include:

Negative impacts of changes in volatility structure
Significant technical risk of sustained price weakness
Price mean reversion
Econometric negative capital flow indicators

The RQSI Hedged Small Cap Equity Fund is available in a separate account for large investors.


The RQSI Small Cap Hedged Equity Fund is distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co., which is not affiliated with Ramsey Quantitative Systems, Inc. or any of its affiliates.  Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA’s BrokerCheck.

RQSI Global Asset Allocation Fund (RQSI GAA)
The RQSI Global Asset Allocation Fund (the "Fund") is a purely systematic, global futures strategy designed to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns with little or no correlation to traditional asset classes.
RQSI has been engaged in developing investment strategies based on econometric, quantitative and technical trading factors for over 20 years. The Fund represents a fusion of our expertise and experience into a single investment product that combines a strong econometric based asset allocation process to proven quantitative and technical inputs. The Fund invests in Global Equities, Global Fixed Income, Commodities and Currencies and focuses on three main market drivers:

Econometric
Technical
Relative Value

The Fund recognizes that at times there are inherent conflicts and contradictions between these three drivers of return and allows the interaction of these drivers to develop on a continuum basis taking into account the fact that the four asset classes - Global Equities, Global Fixed Income, Commodities and Currencies, provide differing return streams under different economic scenarios.
The RQSI Global Asset Allocation Fund is available in an offshore fund or in a separate account for large investors.

Ramsey Quantitative Systems, Inc. Selects SEI's Series Trust As Turnkey Operating Platform For New Small Cap Hedged Equity Fund



Advisors� Inner Circle Fund to Help Accelerate Growth of Assets through Traditional Advisor, Family Office, and Institutional Channels
OAKS, Pa., Sept. 23, 2015 � SEI�s Advisors� Inner Circle Fund® (AIC) II has been selected by Ramsey Quantitative Systems, Inc. (RQSI), a global asset oriented investment firm, as the turnkey operating structure for their new Small Cap Hedged Equity Fund (the �Fund�). Through its Investment Manager Services (IMS) division, SEI (NASDAQ:SEIC) supplies customized operating infrastructure and services to investment organizations around the world.

The Fund is a long-term portfolio designed to provide dynamic exposure to quality U.S. small cap companies. It also provides a daily hedge, designed to offer some protection during market drawdowns. The hedge model includes negative impacts of changes in volatility structure, significant technical risk of sustained price weakness, price mean reversion, and econometric negative capital flow indicators.
