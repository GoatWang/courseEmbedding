Unit investment trust

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

For the UK fund types, see Unit trust and Investment trust.
In U.S. financial law, a unit investment trust (UIT) is an exchange-traded mutual fund offering a fixed (unmanaged) portfolio of securities having a definite life. Unlike open-end and closed-end investment companies, a UIT has no board of directors. [1] A UIT is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is classified as an investment company.[2] UITs are assembled by a sponsor and sold through brokerage firms to investors.[3]

Types[edit]
A UIT portfolio may contain one of several different types of securities. The two main types are stock (equity) trusts and bond (fixed-income) trusts.
Unlike a mutual fund, a UIT is created for a specific length of time and is a fixed portfolio, meaning that the UIT’s securities will not be sold or new ones bought, except in certain limited situations (for instance, when a company is filing for bankruptcy or the sale is required due to a merger).[4]
Stock trusts[edit]
Stock trusts are generally designed to provide capital appreciation and/or dividend income. They usually issue as many units (shares) as necessary for a set period of time before their primary offering period closes. Equity trusts have a set termination date, on which the trust liquidates and distributes its net asset value as proceeds to the unitholders. (The unitholders may then have special options for the reinvestment of this principal.)
Bond trusts[edit]
Bond trusts issue a set number of units, and when they are all sold to investors, the trust's primary offering period is closed. Bond trusts pay monthly income, often in relatively consistent amounts, until the first bond in the trust is called or matures. When this occurs, the funds from the redemption are distributed to the clients via a pro-rata return of principal. The trust then continues paying the new monthly income amount until the next bond is redeemed. This continues until all the bonds have been liquidated out of the trust. Bond trusts are generally appropriate for clients seeking current income and stability of principal.
Legal status and documents[edit]
A UIT may be constituted as either a regulated investment company (RIC) or a grantor trust. A RIC is a trust, corporation or partnership in which investors have common investment and voting rights but do not have direct interest in investments of the investment company or fund. A grantor trust, in contrast, grants investors proportional ownership in the underlying securities.
A UIT is created by a document called the Trust Indenture. This document is drafted by the Sponsor of the fund, and names the Trustee and the Evaluator. By US law, the Sponsor and the Trustee may not be the same. The sponsor selects and assembles the securities to be included in the fund. The trustee keeps the securities, maintains unitholder records, and performs all accounting and tax reporting for the portfolio. The largest issuer of UITs is First Trust Portfolios. Other sponsors include Incapital, SmartTrust, Invesco Unit Trusts, Millington Securities, Advisors Asset Management[5] and Guggenheim Funds. Most large brokerage firms (such as Merrill Lynch and LPL Financial) sell UITs created by these sponsors.
Tax perspective[edit]
From a tax perspective, UIT's offer a shelter from the unrealized capital gains taxes typical inside of a mutual fund. Because individual UIT's are assembled and purchased for specific periods of time, the cost basis consists of the initial purchase price of the securities held in the trust. A mutual fund on the other hand, taxes the individual based on the entire previous tax year regardless of the date purchased. An investor could, for example, purchase a mutual fund in October, absorb a loss during the last quarter of the year, and yet still be taxed on capital gains within the fund depending on the overall performance of the underlying securities from January 1 of the current year. A UIT avoids this potential tax consequence by assembling an entirely new "investment" for each individual investor.
Some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are technically classified as UITs: however, ETFs usually do not have set portfolios (they are either managed or update automatically to follow an index), and can have lifetimes of over 100 years. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust is scheduled to terminate January 21, 2118,[6] and the PowerShares QQQ Trust is scheduled to terminate March 4, 2124.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Investment Trusts
Here today. Here tomorrow.


Having helped many thousands of investors, we’re confident that with the right management, stock market investments have the potential to offer strong, long-term rewards. Investing your money within an investment trust – a closed ended investment company listed on the London Stock Exchange - can be an effective way, over the long-term, to enjoy the growth potential of the stock market.


At Invesco Perpetual we manage a range of nine investment trusts. These vary from the relatively new to having over 125 years’ history, but at the heart of each one is the same commitment to investment excellence. Each of the trusts is diligently managed with long-term performance in mind, based on an active, high conviction approach to investing. 




"I strongly believe the best way to invest in companies is to take a long-term approach and act as much as possible as an owner of a part of a company, rather than as a speculator in share prices"
- Ciaran Mallon,  UK Equities Fund Manager




The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc 

Managed by Mark Barnett, the Company invests primarily in UK securities with the long-term objective of achieving an increase of the Net Asset Value per share by more than the growth in the FTSE All-Share Index; and growth in dividends per share by more than the rate of UK inflation.

Perpetual Income and Growth Investment Trust plc

Invesco Income Growth Trust plc  
 
Managed by Ciaran Mallon, the Company’s investment objective is to produce income and capital growth superior to that of the UK stock market and dividends paid quarterly that, over time, grow above the rate of inflation.

Invesco Perpetual Enhanced Income Limited

Managed by Paul Causer, Paul Read and Rhys Davies, the Company’s principal objective is to provide shareholders with a high level of income whilst seeking to maximise total return through investing in a diversified portfolio of high yielding corporate and government bonds.

Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc 

This is a multi-asset class investment trust with four share portfolios with a range of objectives suited to investors looking for a long-term investment with the flexibility to react to changing investment conditions. Shareholders are able to convert between the four share classes once per quarter allowing maximum flexibility to gain exposure to their preferred asset classes without triggering a disposal for Capital Gains Tax purposes.

Important information
The value of investments and any income will fluctuate (this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations) and investors may not get back the full amount invested. 
When making an investment in an investment trust or investment company you are buying shares in a company that is listed on a stock exchange. The price of the shares will be determined by supply and demand. Consequently, the share price of an investment trust or investment company may be higher or lower than the underlying net asset value of the investments in its portfolio and there can be no certainty that there will be liquidity in the shares. 
Current tax levels and reliefs may change. Depending on individual circumstances, this may affect investment returns. 
Where Invesco Perpetual has expressed views and opinions, these may change. 
The investment trusts and investment companies may use borrowings to invest in the market. The use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trusts’ and investment companies’ assets are rising, but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall. The use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share. In certain circumstances, the investment trusts and investment companies may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns. 
The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc, Invesco Asia Trust plc, Invesco Perpetual UK Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc, Keystone Investment Trust plc and Perpetual Income and Growth Investment Trust plc may invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the investment trusts may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved.
Invesco Income Growth Trust plc may, subject to Board approval, invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the investment trust may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved. At present the Directors have not sanctioned the use of any derivatives. 
As the Invesco Asia Trust plc is an emerging markets investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise. 
As the Invesco Perpetual UK Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc is a smaller companies investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate. 
The City Merchants High Yield Trust Limited and Invesco Perpetual Enhanced Income Limited have a significant proportion of high-yielding bonds, which means that there is more risk to investors’ capital and income than from a Company investing in government or investment grade bonds. Income from the investment may fluctuate and is not guaranteed. The Companies may invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the Companies may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved. 
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc may use derivatives for the purpose of efficient portfolio management. There may not be a precise correlation between price movements in the underlying securities, currency or index, on the one hand, and price movements in the investments, which are the subject of the hedge, on the other. In addition, an active market may not exist for a particular derivative instrument at any particular time.
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc Global Equity Income portfolio may invest in emerging market securities. Investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate, as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise.
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc Balanced Risk portfolio will make significant use of financial derivatives (complex instruments) which will result in large fluctuations in the value of the investment trust. Leverage created from borrowing on certain types of transactions including derivatives may impair the investment trust liquidity, cause it to liquidate positions at unfavourable times or otherwise cause the investment trust not to achieve its intended objective. Leverage occurs when the economic exposure created by the use of derivatives is greater than the amount invested resulting in the investment trust being exposed to a greater loss than the initial investment.
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc Balanced Risk portfolio will gain exposure to commodities which are generally considered to be high risk investments and may result in large fluctuations in the value of the investment trust.
The Directors intend that each portfolio will effectively operate as if it were a stand-alone company. However, prospective investors should be aware that in the event that any of the portfolios have insufficient funds or assets to meet all of its liabilities, such a shortfall would become a liability of the other portfolios. In addition, should the investment trust incur material liabilities in the future, a significant fall in the value of the investment trust’s assets as a whole may affect the investment trust’s ability to pay dividends on a particular class of Shares, even though there are distributable profits attributable to the relevant portfolio.
The investment trust may use borrowings to invest in the market. The use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trust’s assets is rising, but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall. The use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share. In certain circumstances, the investment trust may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns.
The investment trust expects to increase dividend payments on the Global Equity Income and UK Equity shares by making use of its ability to distribute capital. To the extent the investment trust uses its ability to fund dividends using capital profit this will reduce capital growth.
For more information on our products, please refer to the relevant Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive document (AIFMD) and the latest Annual or Half-Yearly Financial Reports, which include both the general and specific risks associated with investing in the investment trusts, before you make your decision. This information is available on our website www.invescoperpetual.co.uk or by using the contact details shown.
Further details of the Companies’ Investment Policies and Risks and Investment Limits can be found in the Report of the Directors contained within the Companies’ Annual Financial Reports. 
If you are unsure if a product is suitable for you, you should seek advice from a financial adviser. For details of your nearest financial adviser, visit www.unbiased.co.uk
