          *Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy and Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at its discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client's account should be bought or sold. As a discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor's account which Fidelity Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy and/or Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios does not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    


Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.



Stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company, industry, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Investing in stock involves risks, including the loss of principal.


          Investors considering investments in bond funds should know that, generally speaking, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds, do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.
	
    

          Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service®, Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines, Fidelity® Wealth Management AdvisorySM, and BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio are services provided by Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines includes the Breckinridge Intermediate Municipal Separately Managed Account, the Fidelity® Equity-Income Strategy, and the Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy. Fidelity Go® is a service provided by Strategic Advisers, Inc., and by Geode Capital Management, LLC, an unaffiliated registered investment adviser. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios may be offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., or Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank. Nondeposit investment products and trust services offered through FPTC and its affiliates are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, are not obligations of any bank, and are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. These advisory services are provided for a fee.


Brokerage services are provided by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Custody and other services are provided by National Financial Services LLC. Both are Fidelity Investments companies and members of NYSE and SIPC.
	
    

Strategic Advisers, Inc., and BlackRock Investment Management, LLC, are independent entities and are not legally affiliated. Strategic Advisers, Inc., is the investment manager for client accounts and implements trades for the accounts based on the model portfolio of investments it receives from BlackRock Investment Management, LLC. Strategic Advisers may select investments for an account that differ from BlackRock Investment Management's model.


          The CFA designation is offered by the CFA Institute. To obtain the CFA charter, candidates must pass three exams demonstrating their competence, integrity, and extensive knowledge in accounting, ethical and professional standards, economics, portfolio management, and security analysis, and must also have at least three years of qualifying work experience, among other requirements.

Our mission is to provide the families and businesses we serve with innovative financial strategies, solutions and planning that result in financial clarity and security.
In the financial services industry, there are generally two ways of obtaining financial advice; one is given by investment advisors and the other by registered representatives or brokers. We feel that information is power in today’s difficult financial world. That is why we have chosen to be investment advisor representatives as well as registered representatives. We are registered representatives to provide the products needed to solve for a complete financial portfolio, and we are investment advisors because of our commitment to do so as a fiduciary.
Investment Advisor Representatives provide advice about numerous investment products including stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investments advisors are fiduciaries with an affirmative duty of utmost good faith and full and fair disclosure of all material fact.
As your investment advisor we promise to:

Put your interests first
Understand your specific financial situation
Offer straightforward advice that reflects your long-term goals

We offer prospective clients an initial complimentary risk assessment where we provide analysis of current investments, personalized income projections, and ideas for immediate implementation, as well as a complimentary third party review.

        Strategic Advisers, Inc. (Strategic Advisers), applies tax-sensitive investment management techniques in FPP and PTS (including “tax-loss harvesting”) on a limited basis, at its discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client’s account should be bought or sold. As a discretionary investment manager, Strategic Advisers may elect to sell assets in an account at any time. A client may have a gain or loss when assets are sold. Strategic Advisers does not currently invest in tax-deferred products, such as variable insurance products, or in tax-managed funds in FPP or PTS, but may do so in the future if it deems such to be appropriate for a client. Strategic Advisers does not actively manage for alternative minimum taxes; state or local taxes; foreign taxes on non-U.S. investments; or estate, gift, or generation-skipping transfer taxes. Strategic Advisers relies on information provided by clients in an effort to provide tax-sensitive investment management and does not offer tax advice. Strategic Advisers can make no guarantees as to the effectiveness of the tax-sensitive management techniques applied in serving to reduce or minimize a client’s overall tax liabilities or as to the tax results that may be generated by a given transaction. Except where Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, is serving as trustee, FPP and PTS clients are responsible for all tax liabilities arising from transactions in their accounts, for the adequacy and accuracy of any positions taken on tax returns, for the actual filing of tax returns, and for the remittance of tax payments to taxing authorities.



Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.
