(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Certain statements in this report and elsewhere (such as in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), press releases, presentations by the Company of its management and oral statements) may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and "should," and variations of these words and similar expressions, are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, among others, competitive pressures and constantly changing technology and market acceptance of the Company's products and services. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  Business Overview  Grasshopper Staffing Inc (the "Grasshopper Staffing"), formally Tomichi Creek Outfitters was formed in the state of Nevada on June 25, 2013. We are a development stage company with a plan of operation to provide clients with an opportunity to harvest a trophy size elk or deer or to enjoy a guided scenic tour on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Our operations are located in Sargents, Colorado which is approximately four hours southwest from Denver.  On March 2, 2015, we entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement under which we acquired the business and assets of Grasshopper Staffing in exchange for 250,000 shares of common stock. The assets purchased include the trademark and website, office supplies and office furniture. Grasshopper is operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary.  Grasshopper Staffing was founded in 2015 by Wick, Melanie Osterman, Barbara Ianne, and Cheryl Zanotelli, as a solution to the staffing needs presented in the blossoming cannabis industry in Colorado. Grasshopper Staffing is an agency that serves the Colorado's cannabis employment needs by providing employee recruiting, training, securing proper credentials and ensuring compliance with the ever-changing local and state laws. Grasshopper Staffing specializes in providing budtenders, trimmers, janitorial, security, payroll, armored transport, edible production, infusion specialists, grow consultants, irrigation, retail sales, IT solutions, web design, and event services.  Plan of Operation  Company management and affiliated business development consultants plan to leverage our extensive operational, industry, M&A and finance contacts and experience to quickly expand upon the foundation recently established at Grasshopper Staffing. We plan to greatly increase our staffing efforts in both the cannabis and non-cannabis space through existing business expansion and acquisitions. Potential cannabis acquisition targets have been identified in Colorado, as well as addition states where cannabis has been legalized for medical or recreational usage with plans for an eventual national footprint. In addition, staffing companies outside of the cannabis space have also been identified as potential acquisition targets, which will allow for diverse sources of revenue. To further our diversification, the company plans to pursue additional acquisition targets within the cannabis space, including businesses specializing in security, testing, proprietary growing equipment, comprehensive facility consulting, facility leasing and unique social media entities. To this end, in the near future "Grasshopper Staffing" will change its name to simply "Grasshopper" to better reflect its plans to aggressively grow into the preeminent multifaceted cannabis company in the fastest growing business space in the United States today.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Results of Operations  The Company had $146,305 and $0 of revenue during the years ended July 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in revenue during the year ended July 31, 2015 was due to revenue achieved by contract staffing services.  General and Administrative Expenses  The Company's general and administrative expenses were incurred in the amounts of $396,089 and $29,809 for the years ended July 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This increase of $366,280 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses.  Net Loss  The comparable net loss for the year ended July 31, 2015, as compared to the net loss for the year ended July 31, 2014, was $346,413 and $29,809, respectively. This increased net loss was due primarily to the increase in general and administrative expenses, particularly payroll and related expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Net cash used in operations was $19,517 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 compared to $14,058 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net loss during the year ended July 31, 2015 offset by an increase in stock compensation expense in the year ended July 31, 2015.  Cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 were $14,071 compared to $32,500 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2014. During the year ended July 31, 2015, we had proceeds from shareholder loans of $25,755 offset by repayments of shareholder loans of approximately $11,684.  The Company's cash balance at July 31, 2015 was $17,617. As a result, the Company will need to generate sufficient revenues and/or seek additional funding in the near future. The Company currently does not have a specific plan of how it will obtain such funding; however, the Company anticipates that additional funding will be in the form of debt financing and/or equity financing from the sale of the Company's common stock.  At this time, the Company cannot provide investors with any assurance that it will be able to generate sufficient revenues and/or obtain sufficient funding from debt financing and/or the sale of its common stock to meet its obligations over the next twelve months. The Company does not have any arrangements in place for any future financing. The Company may also seek to obtain short-term loans from its officers and directors to meet its short-term funding needs. The Company has no material commitments for capital expenditures as of July 31, 2015.  The financial position of the Company at the year ended July 31, 2015 showed an increase in assets to $49,951 from $23,063 at July 31, 2014. This was due primarily to increases in the Company's deferred accounts receivable amounts. The liabilities at July 31, 2015 increases to $61,968 from $21,851 at July 31, 2014. This increase was partially the result of an increase in accounts payable and monies due to a related party.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The Company believes that the following critical policies affect the Company's more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the Company's financial statements.  The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. These principals require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with the Board; however, actual results could differ from those estimates.  The Company issues restricted stock to consultants for various services and employees for compensation. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is measurable more reliably measurable. The value of the Common Stock is measured at the earlier of: (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.  The Company issues options and warrants to consultants, directors, and officers as compensation for services. These options and warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes model, which focuses on the current stock price and the volatility of moves to predict the likelihood of future stock moves. This method of valuation is typically used to accurately price stock options and warrants based on the price of the underlying stock.  Long-lived assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available, The Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.  Fair value estimates used in preparation of the financial statements are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, accounts payable, note payable and due to related parties. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short-term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are receivable or payable on demand.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue is derived from the placement of temporary workers. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and estimable in accordance with ASC 605, "Revenue Recognition". The Company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met:  �  Persuasive evidence for an agreement exists;  �  Service has been provided;  �  The fee is fixed or determinable; and,  �  Collection is reasonably assured.  Capital Resources.  We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of July 31, 2015.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as of July 31, 2015 and 2014.  Nov 23, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 1 "Financial Statements" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Business Overview  Grasshopper Staffing Inc ("Grasshopper Staffing"), formally Tomichi Creek Outfitters was formed in the state of Nevada on June 25, 2013. We are a development stage company with a plan of operation to provide clients with an opportunity to harvest a trophy size elk or deer or to enjoy a guided scenic tour on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Our operations are located in Sargents, Colorado which is approximately four hours southwest from Denver.  On March 2, 2015, we entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement under which we acquired the business and assets of Grasshopper Staffing in exchange for 250,000 shares of common stock. The assets purchased include the trademark and website, office supplies and office furniture. Grasshopper is operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary and is now the primary operation of our business.  Grasshopper Staffing was founded in 2015 as a solution to the staffing needs presented in the blossoming cannabis industry in Colorado. Grasshopper Staffing is an agency that serves the Colorado's cannabis employment needs by providing employee recruiting, training, securing proper credentials and ensuring compliance with local and state laws. Grasshopper Staffing specializes in providing budtenders, trimmers, janitorial, security, payroll, armored transport, edible production, infusion specialists, grow consultants, irrigation, retail sales, IT solutions, web design and event services.  Plan of Operation  Company management and affiliated business development consultants plan to leverage our extensive operational, industry, M&A and finance contacts and experience to quickly expand upon the foundation recently established at Grasshopper Staffing. We plan to greatly increase our staffing efforts in both the cannabis and non-cannabis space through existing business expansion and acquisitions. Potential cannabis acquisition targets have been identified in Colorado, as well as addition states where cannabis has been legalized for medical or recreational usage with plans for an eventual national footprint. In addition, staffing companies outside of the cannabis space have also been identified as potential acquisition targets, which will allow for diverse sources of revenue. To further our diversification, the company plans to pursue additional acquisition targets within the cannabis space, including businesses specializing in security, testing, proprietary growing equipment, comprehensive facility consulting, facility leasing and unique social media entities. To this end, in the near future "Grasshopper Staffing" will change its name to simply "Grasshopper" to better reflect its plans to aggressively grow into the preeminent multifaceted cannabis company in the fastest growing business space in the United States today.  The cannabis industry in general historically experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenue and net income. The Company's revenues reflect two cutting periods resulting in higher revenues in the months of May through July and October through December. Therefore, the results of operations presented for the nine months ended April 30, 2016, are not necessarily representative of the results of operations for the full year.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Results of Operations  For the three months ended April 30, 2016 compared to 2015  The Company had $60,844 and $32,716 of revenue during the three months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase of $28,128 was due to revenue achieved by contract staffing services.  General and Administrative Expenses  The Company's general and administrative expenses were incurred in the amounts of $3,618,521 and $6,119 for the three months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase of $3,612,402 was primarily due to the fair value of warrants in the amount of $3,221,070 that were issued in the three months ended April 30, 2016. In addition, there was also an increase in professional fees along with an increase in payroll and related expenses.  Net Loss  The comparable net loss for the three months ended April 30, 2016 was $3,600,873, as compared to the net incomes for the three months ended April 30, 2015, of $14,446. This increased net loss of $3,615,319 was due primarily to the fair value of warrants in the amount of $3,221,070 that were issued in the three months ended April 30, 2016. In addition, there was also an increase in professional fees along with an increase in payroll and related expenses.  For the nine months ended April 30, 2016 compared to 2015  The Company had $305,902 and $32,716 of revenue during the nine months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase of $273,186 was due to revenue achieved by contract staffing services.  General and Administrative Expenses  The Company's general and administrative expenses were incurred in the amounts of $4,856,652 and $16,200 for the nine months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase of $4,840,452 was primarily due to the fair value of warrants in the amount of $3,221,070 that were issued in the nine months ended April 30, 2016. In addition, there was also an increase in professional fees along with an increase in payroll and related expenses.  Net Loss  The comparable net loss for the nine months ended April 30, 2016 was $4,770,068, as compared to the net income for the nine months ended April 30, 2015, of $4,365. This increased net loss of $4,774,433 was due primarily to the fair value of warrants in the amount of $3,221,070 that were issued in the nine months ended April 30, 2016. In addition, there was also an increase in professional fees along with an increase in payroll and related expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital April 30, 2016 July 31, 2015 (unaudited) (audited) Current Assets $ 28,459 $ 40,595 Current Liabilities 240,788 61,968 Working Capital (Deficiency) $ (212,329) $ (21,373)  Current assets for the quarter ended April 30, 2016 decreased compared to July 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the quarter ended April 30, 2016.  Current liabilities for the quarter ended April 30, 2016 increased compared to July 31, 2015 due to an increase in loans from management and accrued expenses during the quarter ended April 30, 2016.  Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities  Net cash used in operations was $158,692 for the nine months ended April 30, 2016 compared to $27,550 for the nine months ended April 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net loss during the nine months ended April 30, 2016, offset by an increase in stock compensation expense, an increase in common stock issued for services, and an increase in the fair value of warrants issued for services in the nine months ended April 30, 2016.  Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities  Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended April 30, 2016 were $145,806 compared to $8,900 for nine months ended April 30, 2015.  Going Concern  At April 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $5,155,269 and incurred a net loss of $4,770,068 for the nine-month period ended April 30, 2016. We expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which casts substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  We have generated minimal revenues and have incurred losses since inception. Accordingly, we will be dependent on future additional financing in order to finance operations and growth.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as of April 30, 2016.  Jan 23, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Report”) contains
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not historical
facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions,
forward-looking statements may include words such as
“anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “intend,” “could,”
“should,” “would,” “may,”
“seek,” “plan,” “might,”
“will,” “expect,” “predict,”
“project,” “forecast,”
“potential,” “continue”, negatives thereof
or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are found
at various places throughout this Annual Report and include
information concerning: possible or assumed future results of our
operations; business strategies; future cash flows; financing
plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements
regarding future operations, future cash needs, business plans and
future financial results; and any other statements that are not
historical facts.

 

From time
to time, forward-looking statements also are included in our other
periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, in our press releases, in
our presentations, on our website and in other materials released
to the public. Any or all of the forward-looking statements
included in this Annual Report and in any other reports or public
statements made by us are not guarantees of future performance and
may turn out to be inaccurate. These forward-looking statements
represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and
beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties
and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control
and could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements.
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events
described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or
might occur to a different extent or at a different time than we
have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
of this Annual Report. All subsequent written and oral
forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in
this Annual Report and attributable to us or any person acting on
our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Annual
Report.

 

Except to
the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events, a change in events, conditions,
circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or
otherwise.

 

For
discussion of factors that we believe could cause our actual
results to differ materially from expected and historical results
see “Item 1A - Risk Factors” below.

offer guided options in addition to providing maps and information
on where clients can locate what they are interested in if they
wish to trek on their own.  

 

On March
2, 2015, the Company, pursuant to a Business Acquisition Agreement,
(the "Acquisition Agreement”), among the Company, Grasshopper
Staffing, Inc. (“Grasshopper Colorado”), and the
holders of all of the outstanding common stock of Grasshopper
Colorado exchanged their common stock in Grasshopper Colorado for a
total of 250,000 shares of common stock of the Company’s
stock.  The issuance of the 250,000 shares of common stock to
the former holders of Grasshoppers Colorado’s common stock in
exchange for the capital stock of Grasshopper Colorado is referred
to as the reverse acquisition transaction.  As a result of the
reverse acquisition, the Company's business has become the business
of Grasshopper Colorado.

 

Grasshopper
Colorado was founded in 2015 by Amber Wick, Melanie Osterman,
Barbara Ianne, and Cheryl Zanotelli, as a solution to the staffing
needs presented in the blossoming cannabis industry in Colorado.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS.

 

Risks
Related to Our Business

 

Marijuana
remains illegal under federal law

 

Marijuana
is a Schedule I controlled substance and is illegal under federal
law. Even in states that have legalized the use of marijuana, its
sale and use remain violations of federal law. The illegality of
marijuana under federal law preempts state laws that legalize its
use. Therefore, strict enforcement of federal law regarding
marijuana would likely result in our inability to proceed with our
business plan.

 

Our
business is dependent on laws pertaining to the marijuana
industry

 

The United
States federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled
Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811), which places controlled
substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is
classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as highly
addictive and having no medical value. The United States Federal
Drug Administration has not approved the sale of marijuana for any
medical application. Doctors may not prescribe cannabis for medical
use under federal law, however they can recommend its use under the
First Amendment. In 2010, the United States Veterans Affairs
Department clarified that veterans using medicinal cannabis will
not be denied services or other medications that are denied to
those using illegal drugs.

 

As of
November 8, 2016, 25 states, the District of Columbia and Guam
allow their citizens to use medical cannabis through
de-criminalization. Voters in the States of Oregon, Colorado,
Washington, and Alaska have legalized cannabis for adult
recreational use; Oregon’s law took effect on July 1, 2015;
Alaska’s law was effective February 24, 2015; both the
Colorado and Washington programs were enacted as of December 31,
2014. In 2016, Nevada, California, Vermont, Arizona, Connecticut
and Michigan have legislative bills in various stages of progress
concerning cannabis legalization.

 

These
noted state laws, both proposed and enacted, are in conflict with
the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes cannabis use and
possession illegal on a national level. However, on August 29,
2013, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a memorandum providing
that where states and local governments enact laws authorizing
cannabis-related use, and implement strong and effective regulatory
and enforcement systems, the federal government will rely upon
states and local enforcement agencies to address cannabis activity
through the enforcement of their own state and local narcotics
laws. The memorandum further stated that the U.S Justice
Department’s limited investigative and prosecutorial
resources will be focused on eight priorities to prevent unintended
consequences of the state laws, including distribution of cannabis
to minors, preventing the distribution of cannabis from states
where it is legal to states where it is not, and preventing money
laundering, violence and drugged driving.

 

On
December 11, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice issued another
memorandum with regard to its position and enforcement protocol
with regard to Indian Country, stating that the eight priorities in
the previous federal memo would guide the United States Attorneys'
cannabis enforcement efforts in Indian Country. On December 16,
2014, as a component of the federal spending bill, the Obama
administration enacted regulations that prohibit the Department of
Justice from using funds to prosecute state-based legal medical
cannabis programs. As of June 28, 2016, in addition to the 23
states and the District of Columbia which had already passed
legislation allowing citizens to use cannabis in some form, an
additional 13 states had pending legislation or ballot measures to
legalize medical cannabis.

Laws and
regulations affecting our industry are constantly
changing

 

The
constant evolution of laws and regulations affecting the marijuana
industry could detrimentally affect our operations. Local, state
and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in
scope and subject to changing interpretations. These changes may
require us to incur substantial costs associated with legal and
compliance fees and ultimately require us to alter our business
plan. Furthermore, violations of these laws, or alleged violations,
could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect
on our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature of any
future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, and it
is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will
be directly applicable to our business.

 

Risk of
government action

 

While we
will use our best efforts to comply with all laws, including
federal, state and local laws and regulations, there is a
possibility that governmental action to enforce any alleged
violations may result in legal fees and damage awards that would
adversely affect us.

 

Because
our business is dependent upon continued market acceptance by
consumers, any negative trends will adversely affect our business
operations

 

We are
substantially dependent on continued market acceptance and
proliferation of consumers of medical marijuana and recreational
marijuana. We believe that as marijuana becomes more accepted the
stigma associated with marijuana use will diminish and as a result
consumer demand will continue to grow.   While we believe
that the market and opportunity in the marijuana space continues to
grow, we cannot predict the future growth rate and size of the
market. Any negative outlook on the marijuana industry will
adversely affect our business operations.

 

In
addition, it is believed by many that large well-funded businesses
may have a strong economic opposition to the cannabis industry. We
believe that the pharmaceutical industry clearly does not want to
cede control of any product that could generate significant
revenue. For example, medical marijuana will likely adversely
impact the existing market for the current "marijuana pill"
Marinol, sold by the mainstream pharmaceutical industry, should
marijuana displace other drugs or encroach upon the pharmaceutical
industry's products. The pharmaceutical industry is well funded
with a strong and experienced lobby that eclipses the funding of
the medical marijuana movement. Any inroads the pharmaceutical
could make in halting the impending cannabis industry could have a
detrimental impact on our business.

 

FDA
Regulation of marijuana and the possible registration of facilities
where medical marijuana is grown could negatively affect the
cannabis industry which would directly affect our financial
condition

 

Should the
federal government legalize marijuana for medical use, it is
possible that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") would
seek to regulate it under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938.
Additionally, the FDA may issue rules and regulations including
CGMPs (certified good manufacturing practices) related to the
growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of medical
marijuana. Clinical trials may be needed to verify efficacy and
safety. It is also possible that the FDA would require that
facilities where medical marijuana is grown be registered with the
FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations. In
the event that some or all of these regulations are imposed, we do
not know what the impact would be on the medical marijuana industry
and what costs, requirements and possible prohibitions may be
enforced. If we are unable to comply with the regulations and/or
registration as prescribed by the FDA, we may be unable to continue
to operate our business.

Our
clients may have difficulty accessing the service of
banks

 

On
February 14, 2014, the U.S. government issued rules allowing banks
to legally provide financial services to state-licensed marijuana
businesses. A memorandum issued by the Justice Department to
federal prosecutors re-iterated guidance previously given, this
time to the financial industry that banks can do business with
legal marijuana businesses and "may not" be prosecuted. The
Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
issued guidelines to banks that "it is possible to provide
financial services"" to state-licensed marijuana businesses and
still be in compliance with federal anti-money laundering laws. The
guidance falls short of the explicit legal authorization that
banking industry officials had pushed the government to provide and
to date, it is not clear if any banks have relied on the guidance
and taken on legal marijuana companies as clients. The
aforementioned policy may be administration dependent and a change
in presidential administrations may cause a policy reversal and
retraction of current policies, wherein legal marijuana businesses
may not have access to the banking industry. Also, the inability of
potential clients in our target market to open accounts and
otherwise use the service of banks may make it difficult for them
to contract with us.

 

Due to our
involvement in the cannabis industry, we may have a difficult time
obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate our
business, which may expose us to additional risk and financial
liability

 

Insurance
that is otherwise readily available, such as general liability, and
directors and officer’s insurance, is more difficult for us
to find, and more expensive, because we are service providers to
companies in the cannabis industry. There are no guarantees that we
will be able to find such insurances in the future, or that the
cost will be affordable to us. If we are forced to go without such
insurances, it may prevent us from entering into certain business
sectors, may inhibit our growth, and may expose us to additional
risk and financial liabilities.

 

The
Company’s industry is highly competitive and we have less
capital and resources than many of our competitors which may give
them and advantage in developing and marketing products similar to
ours or make our products obsolete.

 

We are
involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with
numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or
approaches, who may have far greater resources, more experience,
and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do. Such resources may
give our competitors an advantage in developing and marketing
products similar to ours or products that make our products
obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully compete against these other entities.

 

The
Company may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change
in its industry and such change may increase costs and competition
that may adversely affect its business

 

Rapidly
changing technologies, frequent new product and service
introductions and evolving industry standards characterize the
Company’s market. The continued growth of the Internet and
intense competition in the Company’s industry exacerbate
these market characteristics. The Company’s future success
will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing
technologies by continually improving the performance features and
reliability of its products and services. The Company may
experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful
development, introduction or marketing of its products and
services. In addition, any new enhancements must meet the
requirements of its current and prospective users and must achieve
significant market acceptance. The Company could also incur
substantial costs if it needs to modify its products and services
or infrastructures to adapt to these changes.

 

The
Company also expects that new competitors may introduce products,
systems or services that are directly or indirectly competitive
with the Company. These competitors may succeed in developing,
products, systems and services that have greater functionality or
are less costly than the Company’s products, systems and
services, and may be more successful in marketing such products,
systems and services. Technological changes have lowered the cost
of operating communications and computer systems and purchasing
software. These changes reduce the Company’s cost of
providing services but also facilitate increased competition by
reducing competitors’ costs in providing similar services.
This competition could increase price competition and reduce
anticipated profit margins.

The
Company’s industry is highly competitive and we have less
capital and resources than many of our competitor, which may give
them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to

We are
involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with
numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or
approaches, who may have far greater resources, more experience,
and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do. Such resources may
give our competitors an advantage in developing and marketing
products similar to ours or products that make our products
obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully compete against these other entities.

 

The
Company’s services are new and its industry is
evolving.

 

You should
consider the Company’s prospects in light of the risks,
uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by companies
in their early stage of development, particularly companies in the
rapidly evolving legal cannabis industry. To be successful in this
industry, the Company must, among other things:

 

·

develop
and introduce functional and attractive service
offerings;

 

·

attract
and maintain a large base of consumers;

 

·

increase
awareness of the Company brand and develop consumer
loyalty;

 

·

establish
and maintain strategic relationships with distribution partners and
service providers;

 

·

respond to
competitive and technological developments;

 

·

build an
operations structure to support the Company business;
and

 

·

attract,
retain and motivate qualified personnel.

 

The
Company cannot guarantee that it will succeed in achieving these
goals, and its failure to do so would have a material adverse
effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and
operating results.

 

Some of
the Company’s products and services are new and are only in
early stages of commercialization. The Company is not certain that
these products and services will function as anticipated or be
desirable to its intended market. Also, some of the Company’s
products and services may have limited functionalities, which may
limit their appeal to consumers and put the Company at a
competitive disadvantage. If the Company’s current or future
products and services fail to function properly or if the Company
does not achieve or sustain market acceptance, it could lose
customers or could be subject to claims which could have a material
adverse effect on the Company business, financial condition and
operating results.

 

As is
typical in a new and rapidly evolving industry, demand and market
acceptance for recently introduced products and services are
subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. Because the market
for the Company is new and evolving, it is difficult to predict
with any certainty the size of this market and its growth rate, if
any. The Company cannot guarantee that a market for the Company
will develop or that demand for Company services will emerge or be
sustainable. If the market fails to develop, develops more slowly
than expected or becomes saturated with competitors, the
Company’s business, financial condition and operating results
would be materially adversely affected.

 

Risks
Related to Our Company

 

Uncertainty
of profitability

 

Our
business strategy may result in increased volatility of revenues
and earnings. As we will only develop a limited number of products
and services at a time, our overall success will depend on a
limited number of products and services, which may cause
variability and unsteady profits and losses depending on the
products and services offered.




9

 

  

 

Our
revenues and our profitability may be adversely affected by
economic conditions and changes in the market for medical and
recreational marijuana. Our business is also subject to general
economic risks that could adversely impact the results of
operations and financial condition.

 

Because of
the anticipated nature of the products and services that we will
attempt to develop, it is difficult to accurately forecast revenues
and operating results and these items could fluctuate in the future
due to a number of factors. These factors may include, among other
things, the following:

 

·

Our
ability to raise sufficient capital to take advantage of
opportunities and generate sufficient revenues to cover
expenses.

 

·

Our
ability to source strong opportunities with sufficient risk
adjusted returns.

 

·

Our
ability to manage our capital and liquidity requirements based on
changing market conditions generally and changes in the developing
legal medical marijuana and recreational marijuana
industries.

 

·

The
acceptance of the terms and conditions of our licenses and/or the
acceptance of our royalties and fees.

 

·

The amount
and timing of operating and other costs and expenses.

 

·

The nature
and extent of competition from other companies that may reduce
market share and create pressure on pricing and investment return
expectations.

 

·

Adverse
changes in the national and regional economies in which we will
participate, including, but not limited to, changes in our
performance, capital availability, and market demand.

 

·

Adverse
changes in the projects in which we plan to invest which result
from factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, a
change in circumstances, capacity and economic impacts.

 

·

Adverse
developments in the efforts to legalize marijuana or increased
federal enforcement.

 

·

Changes in
laws, regulations, accounting, taxation, and other requirements
affecting our operations and business.

 

·

Our
operating results may fluctuate from year to year due to the
factors listed above and others not listed. At times, these
fluctuations may be significant.

 

Management
of growth will be necessary for us to be
competitive

 

Successful
expansion of our business will depend on our ability to effectively
attract and manage staff, strategic business relationships, and
shareholders. Specifically, we will need to hire skilled management
and technical personnel as well as manage partnerships to navigate
shifts in the general economic environment. Expansion has the
potential to place significant strains on financial, management,
and operational resources, yet failure to expand will inhibit our
profitability goals.

 

We are
entering a potentially highly competitive market

 

The
markets for ancillary businesses in the medical marijuana and
recreational marijuana industries are competitive and evolving. In
particular, we face strong competition from larger companies that
may be in the process of offering similar products and services to
ours. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer
operating histories, significantly greater financial, marketing and
other resources and larger client bases than we have (or may be
expected to have).

 

 




10

 

  

 

Given the
rapid changes affecting the global, national, and regional
economies generally and the medical marijuana and recreational
marijuana industries, in particular, we may not be able to create
and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our
success will depend on our ability to keep pace with any changes in
its markets, especially with legal and regulatory changes. Our
success will depend on our ability to respond to, among other
things, changes in the economy, market conditions, and competitive
pressures. Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to
such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and our
operational performance.

 

If we fail
to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control,
we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to
prevent fraud.  Any ability to report and file our financial
results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and
adversely impact the future trading price of our common
stock.

 

Effective
internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial
reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial
reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business
as effectively as we would if an effective control environment
existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be
harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal
control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operation and access to capital.

 

We
currently have insufficient written policies and procedures for
accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.
Additionally, there is a lack of formal process and timeline for
closing the books and records at the end of each reporting period
and such weaknesses restrict the Company’s ability to timely
gather, analyze and report information relative to the financial
statements.

 

Because of
the Company’s limited resources, there are limited controls
over information processing. There is inadequate segregation of
duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company’s
management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting
in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In
order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional
staff.

 

The
Company’s failure to continue to attract, train, or retain
highly qualified personnel could harm the company’s
business.

 

The
Company’s success also depends on the Company’s ability
to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel, specifically
those with management and product development skills. In
particular, the Company must hire additional skilled personnel to
further the Company’s research and development efforts.
Competition for such personnel is intense. If the Company does not
succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating the
Company’s current personnel, the Company’s business
could be harmed.

 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock

 

Because we
will likely issue additional shares of our common stock, investment
in our Company could be subject to substantial
dilution.

 

Investors’
interests in our company will be diluted and investors may suffer
dilution in their net book value per share when we issue additional
shares. We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common
stock, $0.001 par value per share. As of November 22, 2016, there
were 26,287,500 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.
We anticipate that all or at least some of our future funding, if
any, will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our
common stock. If we do sell more common stock, investors’
investment in our company will likely be diluted. Dilution is the
difference between what you pay for your stock and the net tangible
book value per share immediately after the additional shares are
sold by us. If dilution occurs, any investment in our
company’s common stock could seriously decline in
value.

Trading in
our common stock on the OTC Pink has been subject to wide
fluctuations.

 

Our common
stock is currently quoted for public trading on the OTC Pink. The
trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide
fluctuations. Trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in
response to a number of factors, many of which will be beyond our
control. The stock market has generally experienced extreme price
and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with no
current business operation. There can be no assurance that trading
prices and price earnings ratios previously experienced by our
common stock will be matched or maintained. These broad market and
industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our
common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past,
following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company’s securities, securities class-action litigation has
often been instituted. Such litigation, if instituted, could result
in substantial costs for us and a diversion of management’s
attention and resources.

 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws provides for
indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limit
their liability which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the
interests of our shareholders because corporate resources may be
expended for the benefit of officers and/or
directors.

 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws include provisions that
eliminate the personal liability of our directors for monetary
damages to the fullest extent possible under the laws of the State
of Delaware or other applicable law. These provisions eliminate the
liability of our directors and our shareholders for monetary
damages arising out of any violation of a director of his fiduciary
duty of due care. Under Delaware law, however, such provisions do
not eliminate the personal liability of a director for (i) breach
of the director's duty of loyalty, (ii) acts or omissions not in
good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation
of law, (iii) payment of dividends or repurchases of stock other
than from lawfully available funds, or (iv) any transaction from
which the director derived an improper benefit. These provisions do
not affect a director's liabilities under the federal securities
laws or the recovery of damages by third parties.

 

We do not
intend to pay dividends on any investment in the shares of stock of
our Company and any gain on an investment in our Company will need
to come through an increase in our stock’s price, which may
never happen.

 

We have
never paid any cash dividends and currently do not intend to pay
any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we
require additional funding currently not provided for in our
financing plan, our funding sources may prohibit the payment of a
dividend. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain
on an investment in our company will need to come through an
increase in the stock’s price. This may never happen and
investors may lose all of their investment in our
company.

 

Because
our securities are subject to penny stock rules, you may have
difficulty reselling your shares.

 

Our shares
as penny stocks, are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 which imposes additional sales practice
requirements on broker/dealers who sell our company’s
securities including the delivery of a standardized disclosure
document; disclosure and confirmation of quotation prices;
disclosure of compensation the broker/dealer receives; and,
furnishing monthly account statements. These rules apply to
companies whose shares are not traded on a national stock exchange,
trade at less than $5.00 per share, or who do not meet certain
other financial requirements specified by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. These rules require brokers who sell
“penny stocks” to persons other than established
customers and “accredited investors” to complete
certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors, and
provide investors with certain information concerning the risks of
trading in such penny stocks. These rules may discourage or
restrict the ability of brokers to sell our shares of common stock
and may affect the secondary market for our shares of common stock.
These rules could also hamper our ability to raise funds in the
primary market for our shares of common stock.

 

 

 




12

 

  

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s
ability to buy and sell our stock.

 

In
addition to the “penny stock” rules described above,
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as
“FINRA”) has adopted rules that require that in
recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have
reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable
for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers
must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the
customer’s financial status, tax status, investment
objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these
rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that
speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least
some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for
broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common
shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and
have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.

 

There
could be unidentified risks involved with an investment in our
securities

 

The
foregoing risk factors are not a complete list or explanation of
the risks involved with an investment in the securities. Additional
risks will likely be experienced that are not presently foreseen by
the Company. Prospective investors must not construe this the
information provided herein as constituting investment, legal, tax
or other professional advice. Before making any decision to invest
in our securities, you should read this entire prospectus and
consult with your own investment, legal, tax and other professional
advisors. An investment in our securities is suitable only for
investors who can assume the financial risks of an investment in
the Company for an indefinite period of time and who can afford to
lose their entire investment. The Company makes no representations
or warranties of any kind with respect to the likelihood of the
success or the business of the Company, the value of our
securities, any financial returns that may be generated or any tax
benefits or consequences that may result from an investment in the
Company.

PROPERTIES.

 

Our
executive offices are located at 200 S Victoria Ave, Pueblo, Co

$800. We believe that this space is adequate for our needs at this
time, and we believe that we will be able to locate additional
space in the future, if needed, on commercially reasonable
terms.

Approximate
Number of Equity Security Holders

 

Authorized
Capital Stock

 

Our
authorized share capital consists of 200,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 0 shares of preferred stock.
As of November 22, 2016, an aggregate of 26,287,500 shares of
common stock and 0 shares of preferred stock were issued and
outstanding.

 

Common
Stock

 

Holders of
our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all
matters submitted to a stockholder vote. Holders of common stock do
not have cumulative voting rights.

 

Therefore,
holders of a majority of the shares of common stock voting for the
election of directors can elect all of the directors. Holders of
our common stock representing a majority of the voting power of our
capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote,
represented in person or by proxy, are necessary to constitute a
quorum at any meeting of our stockholders. A vote by the holders of
a majority of our outstanding shares is required to effectuate
certain fundamental corporate changes such as liquidation, merger
or an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation.

 

Although
there are no provisions in our charter or by-laws that may delay,
defer or prevent a change in control, we are authorized, without
shareholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock that may
contain rights or restrictions that could have this
effect.

 

 




14

 

  

 

Holders of
common stock are entitled to share in all dividends that the board
of directors, in its discretion, declares from legally available
funds. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each
outstanding share entitles its holder to participate pro rata in
all assets that remain after payment of liabilities and after
providing for each class of stock, if any, having preference over
the common stock. Holders of our common stock have no pre-emptive
rights, no conversion rights and there are no redemption provisions
applicable to our common stock.

 

Approximate
Number of Equity Security Holders

 

As of
November 22, 2016, there were approximately 45 stockholders of
record. Because shares of the Company’s Common Stock are held
by depositaries, brokers and other nominees, the number of
beneficial holders of the Company’s shares is larger than the
number of stockholders of record.

 

Dividends

 

We have
never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We do not
intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future because we
anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings into the
development and growth of our business. Any decision as to the
future payment of dividends will depend on our results of
operations and financial position and such other factors as our
Board of Directors in its discretion deems relevant.

 

Equity
Compensation Plans

 

The
Company does not have in effect any compensation plans under which
the Company’s equity securities are authorized for
issuance.

 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities

 

On March
2, 2015, the registrant entered into a Business Acquisition
Agreement under which the registrant acquired the business and
assets of Grasshopper Staffing in exchange for 250,000 shares of
common stock.

 

On June
12, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved the issuance of
3,175,000 shares of common stock to various employees and
consultants.  The fair market value of the shares was $322,533
at the date of grant, which will be recognized as expense in the
quarter ending July 31, 2015.

 

These
shares were issued in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(2)
of the Securities Act. These shares of the Company’s common
stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) since the issuance
shares by the Company did not involve a public offering. The
offering was not a “public offering” as defined in
Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in
the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number
of shares offered. In addition, the investors had the necessary
investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to
and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such
shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Act. This
restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately
redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a
“public offering.” Based on an analysis of the above
factors, the Company has met the requirements to qualify for
exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for this
transaction.

    

ITEM 6.
SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

 

As a
smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), we are not required to provide the information
required by this item.

Business
Overview

 

Grasshopper
Staffing Inc (the “Grasshopper Staffing”), formally
Tomichi Creek Outfitters was formed in the state of Nevada on June
25, 2013.  We are a development stage company with a plan of
operation to provide clients with an opportunity to harvest a
trophy size elk or deer or to enjoy a guided scenic tour on the
western slopes of the Rocky Mountains.  Our operations are
located in Sargents, Colorado which is approximately four hours
southwest from Denver.  We are located just west of the
continental divide surrounded by 12,000 to 14,000-foot mountain
peaks.  This territory is remote yet accessible with diverse
wildlife which is adjacent to the 1.86 million acre Rio Grande
National Forest.  Grasshopper Staffing’s primary
business is offering professionally guided Elk or Deer animal
hunts.  This area of the country is home to trophy size Elk
and Mule Deer.  Our secondary business includes offering
guided scenic tours.  Every season offers an opportunity to
view diverse wildlife and scenic views for every season of the
year.  We plan to offer guided options in addition to
providing maps and information on where clients can locate what
they are interested in if they wish to trek on their
own.

 

On March
2, 2015, we entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement under
which we acquired the business and assets of Grasshopper Staffing
in exchange for 250,000 shares of common stock. The assets
purchased include the trademark and website, office supplies and
office furniture.  Grasshopper is operating as a wholly-owned
subsidiary.

 

Grasshopper
Staffing was founded in 2015 by Wick, Melanie Osterman, Barbara
Ianne, and Cheryl Zanotelli, as a solution to the staffing needs
presented in the blossoming cannabis industry in Colorado.
Grasshopper Staffing is an agency that serves the Colorado's
cannabis employment needs by providing employee recruiting,
training, securing proper credentials and ensuring compliance with
the ever-changing local and state laws. Grasshopper Staffing
specializes in providing budtenders, trimmers, janitorial,
security, payroll, armored transport, edible production, infusion
specialists, grow consultants, irrigation, retail sales, IT
solutions, web design, and event services.

 

Plan of
Operation

 

Company
management and affiliated business development consultants plan to
leverage our extensive operational, industry, M&A and finance
contacts and experience to quickly expand upon the foundation
recently established at Grasshopper Staffing.  We plan to
greatly increase our staffing efforts in both the cannabis and
non-cannabis space through existing business expansion and
acquisitions. Potential cannabis acquisition targets have been
identified in Colorado, as well as addition states where cannabis
has been legalized for medical or recreational usage with plans for
an eventual national footprint. In addition, staffing companies
outside of the cannabis space have also been identified as
potential acquisition targets, which will allow for diverse sources
of revenue. To further our diversification, the company plans to
pursue additional acquisition targets within the cannabis space,
including businesses specializing in security, testing, proprietary
growing equipment, comprehensive facility consulting, facility
leasing and unique social media entities. To this end, in the near
future “Grasshopper Staffing” will change its name to
simply “Grasshopper” to better reflect its plans to
aggressively grow into the preeminent multifaceted cannabis company
in the fastest growing business space in the United States
today.

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

 

Results of
Operations

 

The
Company had $146,305 and $0 of revenue during the years ended July
31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in revenue during the
year ended July 31, 2015 was due to revenue achieved by contract
staffing services.

 

General
and Administrative Expenses

 

The
Company’s general and administrative expenses were incurred
in the amounts of $396,089 and $29,809 for the years ended July 31,
2015 and 2014, respectively. This increase of $366,280 was
primarily due to an increase in payroll and related
expenses.

 

Net
Loss

 

The
comparable net loss for the year ended July 31, 2015, as compared
to the net loss for the year ended July 31, 2014, was $346,413 and
$29,809, respectively. This increased net loss was due primarily to
the increase in general and administrative expenses, particularly
payroll and related expenses.

  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

Net cash
used in operations was $19,517 for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2015 compared to $14,058 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2014.
This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net loss
during the year ended July 31, 2015 offset by an increase in stock
compensation expense in the year ended July 31, 2015.

 

Cash flows
provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2015 were $14,071 compared to $32,500 for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2014. During the year ended July 31, 2015, we had proceeds
from shareholder loans of $25,755 offset by repayments of
shareholder loans of approximately $11,684.  During the year
ended July 31, 2014, we had proceeds from the issuance of stock of
$30,000. In addition, for the year ended July 31, 2014, we had
proceeds from shareholder loans of $2,600 offset by repayments of
shareholder loans of $100.

 

The
Company’s cash balance at July 31, 2015 was $17,617. As a
result, the Company will need to generate sufficient revenues
and/or seek additional funding in the near future. The Company
currently does not have a specific plan of how it will obtain such
funding; however, the Company anticipates that additional funding
will be in the form of debt financing and/or equity financing from
the sale of the Company’s common stock.

 

At this
time, the Company cannot provide investors with any assurance that
it will be able to generate sufficient revenues and/or obtain
sufficient funding from debt financing and/or the sale of its
common stock to meet its obligations over the next twelve months.
The Company does not have any arrangements in place for any future
financing. The Company may also seek to obtain short-term loans
from its officers and directors to meet its short-term funding
needs. The Company has no material commitments for capital
expenditures as of July 31, 2015.

 

The
financial position of the Company at the year ended July 31, 2015
showed an increase in assets to $49,951 from $23,063 at July 31,
2014.  This was due primarily to increases in the
Company’s deferred accounts receivable amounts. The
liabilities at July 31, 2015 increases to $61,968 from $21,851 at
July 31, 2014. This increase was partially the result of an
increase in accounts payable and monies due to a related
party.
