Seals & Shelters August 1, 2007
PitMaster Under-leveler Seal





Frommelt Products, a division of Rite-Hite Corp., offers the PitMaster Under-leveler Seal. This new product goes beyond the capabilities of traditional loading dock seals and shelters as it closes off the fourth side of the dock opening—beneath and around the dock leveler. The resulting barrier seals air gaps and can greatly reduce energy costs. It also improves overall facility cleanliness by reducing the amount of dirt and debris that enters a facility.
The standard PitMaster fits a variety of leveler types and features a compressible sealing curtain made of durable black vinyl. Spring-loaded arms and flexible stays hold this curtain in place and keep the seal engaged against the leveler and pit sides throughout leveler operation. A separate header curtain constantly maintains the seal even when the leveler is in an above-dock position. The PitMaster closes up the pit and seals air gaps where the leveler, the truck, and the dock seal or shelter all meet.
By helping to prevent heating and cooling from escaping the building, facilities can expect typical energy cost savings of $200 to $900 per year per dock position, depending on climate. PitMaster components accomplish this in two ways. First, air flow is blocked by sealing the gaps below and at the corners of the dock leveler. Second, by securely sealing the pit area, an insulating pocket of dead air forms beneath the leveler, reducing heat transfer through the steel leveler deck.
In addition to standard components, the PitMaster Under-leveler Seal also has a variety of options. Leveler lip-corner seals help to eliminate hard-to-seal gaps at the corners of the dock leveler. When a trailer is in place, optional filler pads close the gaps between the leveler and dock shelter to further seal white space, gaps, and small openings.
The PitMaster installs easily with common tools. A quick-disconnect feature allows the main sealing curtain to be released for access to the leveler pit when dock equipment maintenance is needed. Sealing components require no regular maintenance.

ATLANTA, June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Georgia, meet the new Pit Master in town: Robert Cross. A Georgia resident for the past 15 years, Cross recently took over as Owner/Operator of the Fayetteville Dickey's Barbecue Pit location and is beginning development on a new store in Atlanta. 








Cross, a former multi-unit Subway franchisee, spent the last few years researching different brands for his next venture. He was looking for an enterprising, on-the-move brand and was drawn to Dickey's by their advancement in the industry. He sees it as the perfect concept to be successful in his state.
"There happened to be a Dickey's right across the street from me and ultimately, it was the food that sold me," said Cross. "Barbecue is such a staple food, especially here in the south."
With his sights set on future growth, Cross is eager to travel to Dallas to learn all about the business of barbecue at Barbecue University, Dickey's three-week training program. 
"At Dickey's, we look for franchisees who share our passion and excitement for the barbecue and the business, like Robert," said Laura Rea Dickey, CEO of Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants, Inc. "We welcome him to the family and look forward to a long, successful partnership."
