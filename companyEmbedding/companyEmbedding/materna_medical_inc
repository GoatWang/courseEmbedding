Petition ClosedPetitioning  Materna MedicalDecision makersMaterna MedicalKeep Your “Devices” Out of Our Vaginas!Nicole Stepan Logan, UTNicole StepanLogan, UT1,571SupportersI am a mother saying: enough already with the “devices” that cut, stretch, and tear us in childbirth! For too long, instruments have replaced high-quality, supportive maternity care, and have made women into passive, powerless objects in birth.
The latest proposal, Materna Medical’s vaginal stretcher device promises to “improve outcomes for pregnant women by reducing or preventing injuries associated with vaginal delivery by developing a standardized technique to prepare the tissue for delivery, and to show clinically a reduction in pelvic tissue injury.”1 While I agree that there is a huge clinical need and problem with perineal damage during childbirth, I am adamant that this device is a step in the wrong direction and will ultimately lead to further problems.
Let me explain why this concept is so misguided, outdated, and potentially harmful – beginning with some incorrect statements from your own website:
“Childbirth causes a tremendous amount of injury to mothers.” No, no, no. With optimal care, the vast majority of women can give birth completely normally and naturally. In fact, when 9 in 10 American women receive care that is not based on best evidence – but is applied as a matter of routine – it’s no surprise that our rates of complications, injury, and even death are inflated. We spend $98 billion annually on hospitalization for pregnancy and childbirth, and yet our maternal mortality rate has doubled in the past 25 years. Our country ranks 50th in the world for maternal mortality.2 This statement should read, “The way women are treated in childbirth in the U.S. causes a tremendous amount of injury to mothers.”
“The Materna device intends to take advantage of the time a woman spends in labor to slowly prepare the tissues of the vaginal canal and pelvic floor.” The time a woman spends in labor is not to be taken advantage of by a device.  According to Katysays.com,  “In the case of an unyielding pelvic floor, the problem is not “the hole is not getting bigger,” the problem is “the muscles are not releasing.” So instead of forcing a woman open, literally against her will can we please look at WHY the pelvic floor is so tense it doesn’t release?”3  .
“There are over 3 million vaginal deliveries every year in the United States (approximately 4 million births every year counting C-sections), approximately 10 million annually in developed countries, and 134 million births every year worldwide. Therefore, developing a treatment or prevention method could help millions of women every year across the world.” Developing a new device is not the answer, when the first problem is often a misuse of already existing resources. Implementing the scientifically proven best practices that already exist would go much further to improve childbirth and help mothers and babies. What many of these underutilized best practices have in common is intensive support of the birthing woman in giving birth, not usurping her body with instruments to get a baby out more quickly. You yourselves acknowledged that more experienced providers have fewer tears.  Providers should improve their care, rather than women having to subject themselves to even more interventions to make up for that lack of skill and knowledge.
If you truly care about damaged perineums, you must look beyond the surface to the systemic problems of our maternity system where you will see decreased mobility, purple pushing, and flat back deliveries in nearly every hospital in the US. Take a few hundred dollars of your enormous amount of grant money and visit The Farm in south central Tennessee where perineum damage is near zero percent. Talk to physicians, midwives and others who have successfully kept birthing mothers’ perineums intact.
Last, talk to real mothers about how they feel about having something stuck inside them while they are in labor.  Again, please remember: THESE ARE OUR VAGINAS, our sex organs, as well as our reproductive organs. Most of us are pretty picky about what goes in and around our vaginas. They are important, sensitive, functioning, and powerful – and we’d like to protect them.
 
If there is one thing the past 100 or so years of obstetrical medical technology has taught us, it’s that more is not always better. Our bodies are not inherently unable to stretch. But very often, we are not given what we need – patience, time, and gentleness – in order to stretch and give birth with less risk of complications and injury. It is time that we stop blaming mothers’ bodies and start looking at the evidence bases for damage to our perineums.
 
Treat us like whole human beings during this most vulnerable time, and support us with evidence-based practices, rather than inventing new instruments to stick inside us.
 
Keep the devices out of our vaginas.
