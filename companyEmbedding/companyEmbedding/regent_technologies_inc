	REGENT
	TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY








	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 





	 





	NOTE 1. Description
	of Business and Significant Accounting Policies



	 


	Regent Technologies, Inc., formerly Regent Petroleum Corporation,
	was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on January 18, 1980. During 1999, the Company had re-entered the development
	stage pursuant to ASC No. 915, "Development Stage Activities" ("ASC 915") of the "Financial Accounting
	Standards Codification ("Codification" or "ASC") and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles."
	As of January 1, 2013, due to our ongoing oil and natural gas development activities and future plans for exploration and production,
	management has determined that ASC No. 915 is no longer applicable and accordingly, the ASC No. 915 development stage reporting
	format has been discontinued. In this Form 10-K, references to "we," "our," "us," the "Company,"
	or "Regent" refer to Regent Technologies, Inc. and Regent's wholly-owned subsidiary, Regent Natural Resources Co., a
	Texas corporation, is referred to herein as, the "Subsidiary," or "Regent NRCo."


	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company
	should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
	the year ended December 31, 2014. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 should not be considered
	as indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Significant accounting policies are defined as those accounting
	policies which are most critical to the understanding of a company's financial condition and results of operation. We consider
	an accounting estimate or judgment to be critical if (i) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the
	estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected and could have a material
	impact on our results of operations or financial condition. A summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied
	by the Company in preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows:


	 




	Consolidation Principles




	 


	The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in
	this report have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
	and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”). The consolidated
	financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary





	and include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that
	are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation.

	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
	in consolidation. Certain data in the prior period’s financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the presentation
	of the current period.


	 




	Estimates and Assumptions






	 




	The preparation of financial statements in conformity US GAAP requires
	our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The accounting policies most affected by management’s
	estimates and assumptions are provisions for depreciation, depletion and amortization, estimates of proved reserves, impairment
	of long-lived assets based on estimates of future net cash flows, and asset retirement obligations based on estimates regarding
	timing and cost of future asset retirements.



	 





	Oil and Natural Gas Properties






	 




	The Company follows the full-cost method of accounting under which all costs associated
	with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly
	identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general
	corporate overhead or similar activities. Estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2014 were prepared by a third party
	engineering firm. See Note 12 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

	REGENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY





	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 

	 






	 




	Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as
	reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the
	value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The
	costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our
	unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the
	properties and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major prospect area where
	individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. We review
	the carrying value of our properties under the full-cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a
	quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less
	accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of
	estimated future net revenues (adjusted for hedges) less estimated future costs to be incurred in developing and producing
	the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects.


	 




	Valuation of Property and Equipment






	 




	Our long-lived assets, including proved oil and natural gas properties
	and equipment, are assessed for potential impairment in their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
	such impairment may have occurred. Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, by necessity, are projections based on geologic and
	engineering data, and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates
	of production and the timing of development expenditures. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground
	accumulations of oil and natural gas that are difficult to measure.


	 


	Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves
	and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from
	the area compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions
	governing future oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workover costs, all
	of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities
	of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties may vary substantially. Furniture and equipment are stated
	at cost.


	 


	Depreciation and depletion of producing oil and natural gas properties
	are calculated using the units-of-production method. Proved developed reserves are used to compute unit rates for unamortized tangible
	and intangible development costs, and proved reserves are used for unamortized leasehold costs. Gains and losses on disposals or
	retirements that are significant or include an entire depreciable or depletable property unit are included in operating income.
	Depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment, consisting of office furniture, computer hardware and software and leasehold
	improvements is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which vary from three to five years.



	 





	Revenue Recognition






	 




	Oil and natural gas revenues are recognized when production is sold
	to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, and if collectability of
	the revenue is probable. Revenues from the production of crude oil and natural gas properties in which we have an interest with
	other producers are recognized using the entitlements method. Differences between actual production and net working interest volumes
	are routinely adjusted.



	 





	Asset Retirement Obligation




	 


	Our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated
	present value of the amount we will incur to plug, abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive
	lives, in accordance with federal, state and local laws. We account for asset retirement obligations based on the guidance of ASC
	No. 410, "Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations" ("ASC 410"), which addresses the required accounting
	and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
	costs. ASC 410 requires that the fair value of an asset's retirement obligation be recorded as a liability in the period in which
	it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Periodic
	accretion of the discount of the estimated liability is treated as accretion expense included in depreciation, depletion and amortization
	on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

	Income Taxes






	 




	We utilize the asset and liability method to account for income
	taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
	and liabilities, and are measured currently enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
	differences are expected to reverse.


	 




	Share-Based Compensation






	 




	We account for equity based compensation under the provisions of ASC No. 718, "Compensation
	- Stock Compensation" ("ASC 718"). ASC 718 requires the recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation
	in operations. The fair value of our stock option awards are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model
	requires the input of subjective assumptions and elections including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of
	each award. In addition, the calculation of equity-based compensation costs requires that we estimate the number of awards that
	will be forfeited during the vesting period. The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the
	award and we elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of ASC 718 with no forfeitures.


	 




	Fair Value Measurements




	 


	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell
	an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair
	value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants, whether in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise.
	The fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance, which includes, among other things, the Company’s
	credit risk. In accordance with the requirements of ASC No. 820, "Fair Value Measurement" ("ASC 820"), the
	Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820 and includes
	this additional information in the notes to the financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of
	those financial instruments. Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair
	valuation of these assets and liabilities are as follows:


	 




	 



	•



	 



	Level 1 Inputs—unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;





	 




	 



	•



	 



	Level 2 Inputs—quotes which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Included in this level are interest rate information and commodity pricing data obtained from third party pricing sources and our creditworthiness; and





	 




	 



	•



	 



	Level 3 Inputs—unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations, based on the Company’s various assumptions and future commodity prices. Included in this level is the carrying value of our investment in MacuCLEAR Preferred Stock (see Note 5).  None of our investments are held for trading purposes.





	 




	Earnings per Common Share




	 


	Earnings per common share are determined under the provisions of
	ASC No. 260, "Earnings per Share" ("ASC 260"), which requires the Company to report both basic earnings per
	share, which is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share, which is based
	on the weighted-average number of the common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive shares outstanding. At June 30, 2015,
	there are no exercisable common stock equivalents that are potentially dilutive. Accordingly, no common stock equivalents are included
	in the earnings per share calculations and basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for all periods presented.

	NOTES

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 


	During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, there were several new accounting
	pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board

	(

	FASB). Each of these pronouncements, as applicable,
	has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements
	has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or operating results. The Company will monitor
	these emerging issues to assess any potential future impact on its consolidated financial statements.


	 




	Other Accounting Policies




	 


	The remaining significant accounting policies of the Company are
	described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the 2014 Form 10-K. In management's opinion, the accounting policies
	and estimates presented in the 2014 Form 10-K have not changed and therefore the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein
	should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014,
	which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 



	NOTE 2. Going Concern Uncertainties



	 


	As of the date of this quarterly report, there is substantial doubt
	regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our business operations
	and material commitments. Our future success and viability, therefore, are dependent upon our ability to generate capital financing.
	We are optimistic that we will be successful in our new business operations and capital raising efforts; however, there can be
	no assurance that we will be successful in generating revenue or raising additional capital. The failure to generate sufficient
	revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect upon the Company and our shareholders. These consolidated
	financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
	a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of
	business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.


	 



	NOTE 3. Private Placement Memorandum



	 


	Effective September 1, 2014, the Company approved a Private Placement Memorandum
	(“PPM”) to raise $1,000,000 through the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of Series A 8% Convertible Preferred Stock
	at $1.00 per share (the “Offering”). Under the PPM, the Company is selling full Units for $50,000
	(“Unit”) with the right to sell half Units. The Company is relying on the federal exemption provided under Rule
	506(b) for treatment of the Offering as an exempt offering of securities and filed a Form D with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission on October 9, 2014.


	 



	NOTE 4. Series A 8% Convertible Preferred
	Stock




	 



	During 2014, we completed the sale of three Series A 8% Preferred Stock Units for $50,000
	each pursuant to the PPM. Each Unit consists of 50,000 shares of Series A 8% Preferred Stock and 50,000 Warrants. The Company
	is continuing to market the remaining 850,000 shares of Series A 8% Preferred Stock under the Offering through 2015. The holders
	of the Preferred Stock have the right, at any time, to convert each Preferred Share into ten (10) shares of Common Stock. Also,
	each Unit pays an 8% annual dividend, payable quarterly in shares of Common Stock of the Company for the first 24 months following
	the sale of the Unit. For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015, the Company recognized preferred stock dividend
	expense of $299 and $886 from the issuance of 29,918 and 88,548 shares of Common Stock respectively. See Note 8 in the Company's
	audited financial statements on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 for further information about the designations
	of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.

	Preferred Stock during December 2014 with the same designations.


	 



	NOTE 6. Properties



	 


	In June 2014, the Company engaged Enstream Capital Markets, LLC to
	provide financial advisory services to the Company on an exclusive basis to assist with the Company’s needs for equity and
	debt capital for several projects under evaluation. The Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement on November 18, 2014
	to acquire certain oil and gas assets in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York which agreement was terminated on December 15, 2014 due
	to the Seller’s inability to satisfy certain conditions precedent to closing. The Company is continuing to negotiate the
	acquisition and has advanced $67,233 toward environmental, engineering and bank fees related thereto.


	 


	In April 2015, we negotiated a third-party exploratory agreement
	and earned a 2.5% carried working interest in the first five wells drilled on 35,000 gross acres in Zavala County, Texas. We have
	the right but not the obligation to continue as a 2.5% working interest participant after our carried interest is completed. The
	participating interest is in all wells drilled and completed for all strategraphic horizons below the Anacacho formation. The
	35,000 acre leasehold has proved producing oil and gas reserves below the Anacacho formation from the Eagle Ford shale and Buda
	limestone and is prospective for the Austin chalk and Pearsall shale formations. Drilling was initiated for the first well on
	April 23, 2015 to test the Buda limestone through an underbalanced horizontal procedure. The drilling of the first well has been
	finalized and the stimulation program is being developed for completion during the third quarter. Drilling for the second well
	was initiated on June 27, 2015 as a vertical well with plans to stimulate and produce the Eagle Ford shale and the Buda limestone
	formations. The drilling has been finalized for the second well and core samples are being evaluated for the development of the
	stimulation program.


	 


	During the second quarter, we performed a geological and geophysical
	evaluation of our properties in Hill County, Texas. We engaged LGT Corporation to analyze the current productive fields and possible
	extensions related to our leaseholds. The results reflect several drillable Woodbine and Austin chalk formation anomalies determined
	utilizing gravity and magnetic mapping, near surface fault expressions, and the area mineralization and thermal analyses based
	on seepage models. Based on the success of the analysis, we initiated activity for the resumption of production from our current
	wells. We own interests in 2 producing wells and one injection well. The wells were placed back in production in July 2015 following
	a series of tests and stimulation treatments. The wells are currently shut-in waiting maintenance to the injection well.




	 



	NOTE 7. Asset Retirement Obligation



	 


	We have included estimated future costs of
	abandonment and dismantlement in our amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depreciation, depletion,
	and accretion expense. The Company has not increased the asset retirement obligation for this quarter due to only nominal impact.

	are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. As of June 30, 2015, we have no unrecognized
	tax benefits and there were no significant changes to the calculation since December 31, 2014.

	the Company. SIG Partners, LC is an entity owned by the President of the Company and is the operator of the Company’s oil
	and gas interests. For the successful negotiation of the Company’s participation in the drilling and development of 35,000
	acres in Zavala County, the Company granted the President a $10,000 bonus in the current quarter and $5,000 in the third quarter
	and a contingent $15,000 payable upon receipt of the net proceeds from the Company’s carried working interest (see Note
	6).


	 



	NOTE 10. Convertible Debentures



	 


	On December 5, 2014, we issued a convertible debenture for monies totaling
	$25,000. The debenture is convertible into shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock at the conversion rate of $25,000
	for 25,000 shares of preferred stock. Under the terms of the debenture, the principal of $25,000 was due on June 30, 2015, plus
	interest at 8% per annum in the amount of $1,139.73. Effective June 30, 2015, the parties agreed to the pay the interest due and
	to extend the maturity date of the debenture to December 31, 2015.

	General and Business Overview




	 


	Our Company is organized as a management company of non-operated
	oil and gas properties. As such, the Company relies on registered professionals for geological and engineering services. The Company
	plans to acquire an operating subsidiary in the future as our critical mass grows. On June 24, 2014 the Company engaged Enstream
	Capital Markets, LLC to provide financial advisory services to the Company on an exclusive basis to assist with the Company’s
	needs for equity and debt capital for several projects under evaluation. The Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement
	on November 18, 2014 to acquire certain oil and gas assets in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York which agreement was terminated on
	December 15, 2014 due to the Seller’s inability to satisfy certain conditions precedent to closing. The Company is continuing
	to negotiate the acquisition and has advanced $67,233 toward environmental, engineering and bank fees related thereto.


	 




	Our strategic imperatives include:




	 






	 



	•



	Selectively pursuing strategic partnerships
	with industry partners that may expand or complement our energy technology development operations.




	 


	•


	Focusing on reservoirs with known hydrocarbon production
	primarily in conventional, shallow, low-cost, permeable carbonate reservoirs with decades of production history.




	 


	•


	Entering into joint ventures with oil and natural gas
	operators who have extensive experience and expertise in the areas selected for exploration to allow us to obtain working
	interests in a number of prospects with minimal overhead.




	 


	Currently we have leasehold rights in two areas of oil and gas
	activity in Texas:


	 




	South Texas Eagle Ford Shale Trend




	 


	We have acquired participation rights in prospects in the Austin
	Chalk, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Buda Lime and the Pearsall Shale. These are considered the primary targets in the stacked oil
	and gas plays of South Texas. In April 2015, we negotiated a third-party exploratory agreement and earned a 2.5% carried working
	interest in the first five wells drilled on 35,000 gross acres in Zavala County, Texas. We have the right but not the obligation
	to continue as a 2.5% working interest participant after our carried interest. The participating interest is in all wells drilled
	and completed for all strategraphic horizons below the Anacacho formation.


	 


	Drilling was initiated for the first well on April 23, 2015 to
	test the Buda limestone through an underbalanced horizontal procedure. The drilling of the first well has been finalized and the
	stimulation program is being developed for completion during the third quarter. Drilling for the second well was initiated on
	June 27, 2015 as a vertical well with plans to stimulate and produce the Eagle Ford Shale and the Buda Limestone formations. The
	drilling has been finalized for the second well and core samples are being evaluated for the development of the stimulation program.
	The 35,000 acre leasehold has proved producing oil and gas reserves below the Anacacho formation from the Eagle Ford shale and
	Buda limestone and is prospective for the Austin chalk and Pearsall shale formations.


	 




	East Texas Fault-line Fields




	 


	During the second quarter, we performed a geological and geophysical
	evaluation of our properties in Hill County, Texas. We engaged LGT Corporation to analyze the current productive fields and possible
	extensions related to our leaseholds. The results reflect several drillable Woodbine and Austin Chalk formation anomalies determined
	utilizing gravity and magnetic mapping, near surface fault expressions, and the area mineralization and thermal analyses based
	on seepage models. Based on the success of the analysis, we initiated activity for the resumption of production from our current
	wells. We own interests in 2 producing wells and one injection well. The wells were placed back in production in July 2015 following
	a series of tests and stimulation treatments. The wells are currently shut-in waiting maintenance to the injection well.

	The
	present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves, before deductions for estimated
	future income taxes and asset retirement obligations, discounted at 10% (“PV-10
	Value”), totaled $1.58 million at December 31, 2014. The commodity prices used
	to estimate proved reserves and their related PV-10 Value at December 31, 2014 were based
	on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic benchmark average of the first-day-of-the-month
	price for the period from January 2014 through December 2014. These benchmark average
	prices were further adjusted for quality, energy content, transportation fees and other
	price differentials specific to our properties, resulting in an average adjusted price
	of $79.81 per barrel of over the remaining life of our proved reserves. Operating costs
	were not escalated.

	None of our oil

	—
	The Company's estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate.  Any significant inaccuracies
	in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves”
	and please read the notes following the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 in conjunction
	with the reserve estimates, both incorporated herein from the Registrant's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 


	 



	Results of Operations



	 


	For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015, we reported
	a net loss applicable to common stock of $33,809 and $56,501 respectively. This compares to a net loss applicable to common stock
	of $18,285 and $39,982 for the same periods in 2014. This increase was primarily due to the $10,000 paid to the President for
	his negotiation of the Company’s participation in the exploration and development of the 35,000 acre leasehold in Zavala
	County. Also, the Company’s resumption of leasehold costs in Hill County added lease operating expenses of $5,900 and $6,950
	for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 respectively. Interest expense was $1,338 for the six months ended June 30, 201
	compared to interest expense of $1,570 for the same period in 2014.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	Regent has funded operations through preferred stock issuances, short-term borrowings and
	equity investment sales in order to meet obligations. Our future operations are dependent upon external funding and our ability
	to increase revenues and reduce expenses. There is no assurance that sufficient funding will be available from additional related
	party borrowings and private placements to meet our business objectives including anticipated cash needs for working capital.


	 


	Net cash flows used in operating activities was $103,965, for the period ending June 30,
	2015, compared to $12,531 of net cash used for the same period in 2014. The increase was due primarily to the prepaid expenses
	of $27,233 and reductions to accounts payable of $10,744 and accrued liabilities to related parties of $10,900. The prepaid expense
	are related to the ongoing negotiations for oil and gas assets in North Appalachia which included $ $25,000 for environmental
	reviews.


	 


	The Company is not performing any product research and development at this time and it is
	not expected to incur significant changes in the number of employees.

	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 


	Our discussion
	and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements which were prepared
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
	requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We
	believe that certain accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
	financial statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, includes a discussion of our critical
	accounting policies and there have been no material changes to such policies during the three months and six months ended June
	30, 2015.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
	Procedures



	 


	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the
	information we must disclose in our filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. At
	the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive and principal financial officers reviewed and evaluated
	the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on
	such evaluation, such officers concluded that, as of the current period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
	to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file under the Act is disclosed within the time
	periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
	is accumulated and communicated to them to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	No changes in the Company's system of internal control over financial
	reporting occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have altered management’s conclusions of inherent limitations
	within the Company regarding internal controls as of December 31, 2014, which conclusions are incorporated herein by reference.

	CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULE 13A-14(a) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934,

	AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES OXLEY ACT OF 2002



	 




	I, David A. Nelson, certify that:


	 




	1.


	I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form
	10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2015 of REGENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.;




	 




	2.


	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;




	 




	3.


	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;




	 




	4.


	I, in my capacity as the Company's certifying officers, am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
	defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
	Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Registrant and have:




	 




	 


	(a)


	designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;




	 




	 


	(b)


	designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;




	 




	 


	(c)


	evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and




	 




	 


	(d)


	disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and




	 




	5.


	I, in my capacity as the Company's certifying officers, have disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	 




	 


	(a)


	all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and




	 




	 


	(b)


	any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.
