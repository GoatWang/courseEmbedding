What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.              
              
            

5:22 p.m. July 27, 2017






Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

About us

Strength. Initiative. Leadership. These are the foundations on which Paz's reputation is based – a golden reputation of 90 years' standing.

The Paz Group is Israel's leading energy corporation and during its 90 years has become one of the economy's most prominent brands. Paz supplies a third of Israel's fuel products and is the country's first energy company to own a refinery. At the end of 2006, Paz became a public company whose shares are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and it is listed on the TASE's flagship Tel Aviv-25 (Maof) index, which tracks the shares of the 25 companies with the highest market capitalization on the bourse. The Group engages in the refining, production, storage, importing and marketing of fuel products. In addition to its refinery in Ashdod, Paz has fuel product storage and distribution terminals and a network of hundreds of filling stations, convenience stores and retail complexes. The Paz Group integrates a variety of activities in the domestic market, including the sale of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), the production and marketing of lubricants and chemicals, bitumen sheets and sealants for the construction and infrastructure sectors, jet fuel and more. The Group's primary advantage is its vertical structure that encompasses the entire value chain. The purchase of the Ashdod refinery, the Group's ownership of hundreds of retail outlets and its sophisticated operating methods facilitate long-term logistic planning and optimal synergy among all the divisions. The Group's financial resilience, combined with advanced work methods, a highly developed service orientation and the ability to zero in on marketing opportunities, have positioned Paz as Israel's top energy company, with a reputation for professionalism and leadership.

 Shale’s efficient, low-cost production cycle continues to complicate rebalancing of the global oil market, but Goldman Sachs’ Head of Commodities Research Jeff Currie sees the balance of risks tilted to the upside for the second half of 2017. Among the contributors? Further drawdown of excess inventories and a cyclical upswing in oil demand.

Ultimately, where the market finds an equilibrium is still uncertain. And driving that uncertainty are the costs and technological innovations that are being generated from the New Oil Order in a shale industry that is continually evolving.

 Overview
 The “New Oil Order” created by the U.S. shale revolution is reshaping global energy markets and bringing with it a new era of volatility.

 Lower for Longer?: The Impact of "The New Oil Order"
 “The decline in oil prices is, on balance, we think a positive for global economic activity. The oil consumers are generally getting a boost.” – Jan Hatzius

 "The New Oil Order" and The Commodity Cycle
 After a decade-long “investment phase” that helped unleash the shale revolution, oil is seeking a new equilibrium between supply and demand.
