Well-built and heavy; don't plan on moving afterwards, as the legs are something of a weak point. 

Main cabinet area fits A/V receiver, gaming consoles and DVD/Blu-ray players perfectly. As others have noted, the drawers are not tall enough to hold DVD cases so the spines can be read.

Shipped in two well-packed boxes; assembles in 1 hour or less with a power driver. Really brings the room together.Great TV standI originally purchased this media stand and it looked so great, I purchased the Stratford Media Cabinet. Very elegant furniture!Mid century styleThis media cabinet is very easy to put together and looks beautiful. Works with a contemporary or transitional setting. It's goi g next to a contemporary pool table, so I know it will look fantastic!Perfect HeightI needed a media cabinet that was substantial enough to present a 50" screen. Although I had some difficulty putting it together, the end result was great.The JetsonsI love this cabinet - it is perfect for me. It reminded me of the Jetson's cartoon and I love that styleFinest media center I've had the joy to assemble!First and foremost, I received the package in one business day. The package is NOT 65 lbs as stated in the UPS tracking. Matter of fact, it's 110 lbs gross weight (99 lbs net weight). Box measures 70.3" x 22.2" x 7.2" - these info lifted straight from the box. You will definitely need two people to lug this box around. For my situation, it's just my wife and I and we live on a second floor condo. We had to take the individual pieces out of the box and transport them upstairs to our home, stairs no elevator - this took us about 20 minutes of back and forth transporting. So be forewarned!

Secondly, the assembly is straight forward. I have to admit, it's more involved than other assembly project I've partook in, but you know what, it's not that hard. The instructions are pretty clear although it's strictly drawings with minimal written information. This could be a problem for the inexperienced DIY'er. But then again, I've read reviews from self-proclaimed experienced DIY'er who "pride themselves" in building things with ease and have had problems with assembling this unit, sometime taking between 3-5 hours to build. I couldn't believe it so I timed myself from start to finish on a stopwatch. It took only myself a total of 1 hour and 47 minutes 42 seconds to assemble with a power drill (wife was busy watching Big Bang Theory in the background). Clearly, if it takes you more than 2 hours to assemble (let alone two people and 5 hours, and STILL got it wrong), you're not as experienced as you'd like to think you are.

The media center requires that you glue wooden dowels into their sockets for maximum installation security - it is not indication of cheaply made material. The package includes two tubes of wood glue, which is basically Elmer's glue. I ended up using both tubes and had to resort to the Elmer's glue in my craft cabinet.

Don't waste your time "pre-assembling" before gluing and tightening all the hardware as another reviewer recommended. Just take your time and follow the instructions carefully and you'll be fine. Some reviewers claim the instructions are wrong after half-way. I have to disagree and interject that they are the one who are wrong and probably cannot follow instructions. Be sure to let the fully assembled media center sit for 24 hours so the glued-in dowels can fully dry.

After all is set and done, this media center is very study, very contemporary and stylish. Our 51" plasma flat screen is mounted on the wall, so clearance is not an issue for us. Only the center housing have two holes to route your wires through - and for newer all-in-one entertainment system, that's all you really need (for example, our Blu-ray player is also a 7.1 wireless home theater system). We got the white and cappuccino model and it compliments our living room's color scheme perfectly. We placed home accent decors (bronze sea turtle statue and ***** *********** vase) on each raised side shelf and the final piece commands attention. The drawers allow us to stash our books and video game console controllers neatly away, affording an uncluttered media center that is quite a contrast to the one this replaced. One of the finer investment we've made all thanks to O.co!Easy to assemble!I was able to assemble this in 3.5 hours alone.  The instructions were very clear.  The product looks exactly as pictured, except that there's more space between the edge of the cabinet and bottom piece when the cabinets are closed.  I am very pleased with the media consule overall and would definitely purchase this brand again.Terrific value!This is a high quality piece.  It is real wood, excellent finish, very sturdy, and well designed.  The doors are made of the same solid ash wood with the fronts painted a light metallic gray, close to a satin silver - rather than beige as the the picture reflects on my device - very nice.  The styling is slightly industrial and retro.

It comes well packaged and protected, no dings, scratches, missing parts, or other problems.  The assembly directions are detailed and understandable.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that when the center support leg is screwed all the way in it's at least an inch shorter than the other legs.  Unscrewing it to add length would decrease this leg's function as a good support for the center of the cabinet. We don't have a lot of weight on or in it so it's not a problem for us, but does seem like a design flaw.

We use it as a media center below our wall mounted TV and are very extremely pleased with the purchase.BEAUTIFUL MULTI-PURPOSE MEDIA/DISPLAY CABINET.THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF FURNITURE TO ADD TO ANY ROOM.  IT'S NOT JUST SOME PRESSBOARD THAT LOOKS NICE, BUT INSTEAD A VERY HEAVY GORGEOUS CHERRY WOOD WITH GLASS PANELED WINDOWS.  WE BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR 60" INCH T.V. AS A STAND AND THE INSIDE WILL HAVE ALL OF OUR OTHER MEDIA COMPONENTS INSIDE!  I JUST LOVE THIS!Sponsored LinksWhat's This?

Maybe not. Here’s a look at the science of the creative process and how to harness your brain’s power to come up with more great ideas.
[Image: Flickr user Folkert Gorter]By Belle Beth Cooper9 minute ReadAh, ideas. Who doesn’t want more great ideas? I know I do.advertisementI usually think about ideas as being magical and hard to produce. I expect them to just show up without me cultivating them, and I often get frustrated when they don’t show up when I need them.The good news is that it turns out cultivating ideas is a process, and one that we can practice to produce more (and hopefully better) ideas. On the other hand, often times great ideas can also just come to us whilst in the shower or in another relaxing environment.First, let’s look at the science of the creative process.How our brains work creativelySo far, science hasn’t really determined exactly what happens in our brains during the creative process, since it really combines a whole bunch of different brain processes. And, contrary to popular belief, it includes both sides of our brains working together, rather than just one or the other.The truth is, our brain hemispheres are inextricably connected. The two sides of our brains are simply distinguished by their different processing styles.The idea that people can be “right brain thinkers” or “left brain thinkers” is actually a myth that I’ve debunked before:advertisement
The origins of this common myth came from some 1960s research on patients whose corpus callosum (the band of neural fibers that connect the hemispheres) had been cut as a last-resort treatment for epilepsy. This removed the natural process of cross-hemisphere communication, and allowed scientists to conduct experiments on how each hemisphere worked in isolation.
Unless you’ve had this procedure yourself, or had half of your brain removed, you’re not right or left brained.

We do have a rough idea of how these processes might work, though.The three areas of the brain that are used for creative thinkingAmong all the networks and specific centers in our brains, there are three that are known for being used in creative thinking.The Attentional Control Network helps us with laser focus on a particular task. It’s the one that we activate when we need to concentrate on complicated problems or pay attention to a task like reading or listening to a talk.The Imagination Network as you might have guessed, is used for things like imagining future scenarios and remembering things that happened in the past. This network helps us to construct mental images when we’re engaged in these activities.The Attentional Flexibility Network has the important role of monitoring what’s going on around us, as well as inside our brains, and switching between the Imagination Network and Attentional Control for us.advertisementYou can see the Attentional Control Network (in green) and the Imagination Network (in red) in the image below.

A recent review by Rex Junge and colleagues explained what they think might be happening in our brains when we get creative. It generally involves reducing activation of the Attentional Control Network. Reducing this partially helps us to allow inspiration in, and new ideas to form. The second part is increasing the activation of the Imagination and Attentional Flexibility Networks.Research on jazz musicians and rappers who were improvising creative work on the spot showed that when they enter that coveted flow state of creativity, their brains were exhibiting these signs.Producing new ideas is a process
The production of ideas is just as definite a process as the production of Fords; —James Webb Young
In his book, A Technique for Producing Ideas, James Webb Young explains that while the process for producing new ideas is simple enough to explain, “it actually requires the hardest kind of intellectual work to follow, so that not all who accept it use it.”He also explains that working out where to find ideas is not the solution to finding more of them, but rather we need to train our minds in the process of producing new ideas naturally.The two general principles of ideasadvertisementJames describes two principles of the production of ideas, which I really like:
An idea is nothing more or less than a new combination of old elements.
The capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on the ability to see relationships.
This second one is really important in producing new ideas, but it’s something our minds need to be trained in:
To some minds each fact is a separate bit of knowledge. To others it is a link in a chain of knowledge.
To help our brains get better at delivering good ideas to us, we need to do some preparation first. Let’s take a look at what it takes to prime our brains for idea-generation.Preparing to get new ideasSince ideas are made from finding relationships between existing elements, we need to collect a mental inventory of these elements before we can start connecting them. James also notes in his book how we often approach this process incorrectly:
Instead of working systematically at the job of gathering raw material we sit around hoping for inspiration to strike us.
Preparing your brain for the process of making new connections takes time and effort. We need to get into the habit of collecting information that’s all around us so our brains have something to work with.James offers a couple of ideas in his book, such as using index cards to organize and distill information into bite-sized pieces. Another suggestion is to use a scrapbook or file, and cross-index everything so you can find what you need, when you need it.advertisementBringing it all togetherThe hard work is mostly in gathering the materials your brain needs to form new connections, but you can do a lot to help your brain process all of this information, as well.In a paper by neuroscientist Dr. Mark Beeman, he explains how we come to our final “aha” moment of producing an idea, by way of other activities:
A series of studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural correlates of the “Aha! moment” and its antecedents. Although the experience of insight is sudden and can seem disconnected from the immediately preceding thought, these studies show that insight is the culmination of a series of brain states and processes operating at different time scales.
I love the way that John Cleese talks about these aspects of creativity and how our minds work. He gave an excellent talk years ago about how our brains develop ideas and solve creative problems, wherein he discussed the idea of our brains being like tortoises. Here’s how I explained his theory when I wrote about it earlier this year:
The idea is that your creativity acts like a tortoise–poking its head out nervously to see if the environment is safe before it fully emerges. Thus, you need to create a tortoise enclosure–an oasis amongst the craziness of modern life–to be a safe haven where your creativity can emerge.
He offers a couple of useful ideas to help you achieve this, as well:Set aside timeJohn says your thoughts need time to settle down before your creativity will feel safe enough to emerge and get to work. Setting aside time to think regularly can be a good way to train your mind to relax, eventually making this set time a safe haven for your tortoise mind to start putting together connections that could turn into ideas.advertisementFind a creative spaceSetting aside time regularly sends a signal to your brain that it’s safe to work on creative ideas. Finding a particular space to be creative in can help, too.This is similar to the research on how the temperature and noise around us affects our creativity.Let your brain do the workThis may be one of the hardest, yet most important parts of the process of producing ideas. I think James Webb Young says it best:
Drop the whole subject and put it out of your mind and let your subconscious do its thing.
Something else John Cleese talks about is how beneficial it can be to “sleep on a problem.” He recalls observing a dramatic change in his approach to a creative problem after having left it alone. He not only awoke with a perfectly clear idea on how to continue his work, but the problem itself was no longer apparent.The trick here is to trust enough to let go.advertisementAs we engage our conscious minds in other tasks, like sleeping or taking a shower, our subconscious can go to work on finding relationships in all the data we’ve collected so far.The Aha moment
James Webb Young explains the process of producing ideas in stages. Once we’ve completed the first three, which include gathering material and letting our subconscious process the data and find connections, he says we’ll come to an “Aha!” moment, when a great idea hits us:
It will come to you when you are least expecting it–while shaving, or bathing, or most often when you are half awake in the morning. It may waken you in the middle of the night.
How to have more great ideasUnderstanding the process our brains go through to produce ideas can help us to replicate this, but there are a few things we can do to nudge ourselves towards having better ideas, too.Criticize your ideas–don’t accept them immediatelyThe final stage of James’s explanation of idea production is to criticize your ideas:
Do not make the mistake of holding your idea close to your chest at this stage. Submit it to the criticism of the judicious.
James says this will help you to expand on the idea and uncover possibilities you might have otherwise overlooked.advertisementHere it’s especially important to know whether you’re introverted or extroverted to criticize your ideas from the right perspective.Overwhelm your brain–it can handle itSurprisingly, you can actually hit your brain with more than it can handle and it will step up to the task.Robert Epstein explained in a Psychology Today article how challenging situations can bring out our creativity. Even if you don’t succeed at whatever you’re doing, you’ll wake up the creative areas of your brain and they’ll perform better after the failed task, to compensate.Have more bad ideas to have more good onesIt turns out that having a lot of bad ideas also means you’ll have a lot of good ideas. Studies have proved this at both MIT and the University of California Davis.advertisementThe sheer volume of ideas produced by some people means that they can’t help having lots of bad ones, but they’re likely to have more good ones, as well.Seth Godin wrote about how important it is to be willing to produce a lot of bad ideas, saying that people who have lots of ideas like entrepreneurs, writers and musicians all fail far more often than they succeed, but they fail less than those who have no ideas at all.He summed this up with an example that I love:
Someone asked me where I get all my good ideas, explaining that it takes him a month or two to come up with one and I seem to have more than that. I asked him how many bad ideas he has every month. He paused and said, “none.”
How do you come up with ideas every day? I’d love your thoughts on this in the comments below!—Belle Beth Cooper is a Content Crafter at Buffer and cofounder of Hello Code.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
