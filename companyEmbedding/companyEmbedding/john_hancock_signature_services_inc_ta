Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.

John Hancock Signature Services - John Hatch






  Company: John Hancock Signature Services, Inc. Boston, MACompany Description: JHSS is an organization of  approximately 200 associates with a  culture built from three core values  which are critical to our success; Our  Customers, Our Associates and Our  Company.Nomination Category:  Management CategoriesNomination Sub Category:  Best Executive - Financial ServicesNomination Title: John R. Hatch - President and CEO, JHSS
 

 

Tell the story about what this nominee achieved since January 1 2007 (up to 500 words). Focus on specific accomplishments, and relate these accomplishments to past performance or industry norms. Be sure to mention obstacles overcome, innovations or discoveries made, and outcomes:
                 

John Hancock has undergone significant growth over the past 5 years.  This global expansion produced challenges in the customer service call centers and affected our ability to provide a consistent customer service experience.  Our parent organization, Manulife Financial, is a firm believer in a decentralized approach to organizational structure.  While this model cultivates expertise within each product; the loss of workplace collaboration can also present challenges.In 2007, senior management within John Hancock recognized that this approach may not be ideal for its wealth management call centers.  They recognized that the customer experience in regard to quality and service levels was not consistent between the mutual fund and annuity call centers.  There was a clear opportunity for collaboration.  Management was committed to delivering a consistent voice and “signature” to all of its customers regardless of which call center they were contacting.   A decision was made to reorganize the mutual fund and annuity call centers under the sole direction of John Hatch.  As President and CEO of JHSS, John’s demonstrated success within the mutual fund organization convinced senior management that John was up to the task.  John’s results-oriented management style along with his frequently spoken philosophy that “the collective ideas of all are better than the great idea of one” made him a perfect individual to drive this collaboration effort.  The transformation started with a new culture based around increased efficiency, associate accountability and creativity.  The reorganization was effective in April 2007. The results were immediate.   Service levels improved by 36% as a result of:• Creation of staffing models and forecasting tools for a proactive approach to hiring.• Utilization of part-time professional staff for high call volume intervals.• Redesigned call flows to provide efficient access to the customer service representatives. Productivity results improved by 15% as a result of:• Implementation of dual monitors for increased efficiency. • Elimination of breaks to simplify staff scheduling.• Average-handle-time reductions. Roles and responsibilities were redefined around increased accountability:• Management-level working groups were formed to ensure continual emphasis on newly-defined goals.• Call Technician role implemented to manage staffing, scheduling, forecasting and reporting. • Quality Assurance roles implemented to build performance measurements, accountability and coaching.Associate-level accountability was built through: • Implementation of new call center reporting to track key performance measures. • Implementation of a performance management plan for employees for increased accountability and a consistent management approach.A culture built around quality was cultivated by:• Creation of employee recognition programs to recognize high performers.• Increased emphasis on call monitoring feedback and coaching.  • Redesign of the new hire training program to incorporate role-playing into their technical learning.• Contracting a third party quality evaluation company to obtain key quality benchmark data.John’s belief in open and honest communication has generated a higher degree of trust, loyalty and responsibility within the Annuity call center.

John Hancock Signature Services - Crawford Clancy






  Company: John Hancock Signature Services, Inc. Boston, MACompany Description: JHSS is an organization of  approximately 200 associates with a  culture built from three core values  which are critical to our success; Our  Customers, Our Associates and Our  Company.Nomination Category:  Support CategoriesNomination Sub Category:  Best Support StafferNomination Title: Crawford Clancy - Going Global
 

 

Tell the story about what this nominee achieved since January 1 2007 (up to 500 words). Focus on specific accomplishments, and relate these accomplishments to past performance or industry norms. Be sure to mention obstacles overcome, innovations or discoveries made, and outcomes:
                 

In October of 2006, JHSS made a decision to move a number of Transfer Agent functions to Manila for processing.  While JHSS has opened sister sites throughout the country, this was our first experience with initiating an off-shore work site for processing resources.  The Training & Development department was given less than 6 months to research, develop, design and deliver the training to the Manila associates; the deadline was March 2007.Crawford Clancy immediately volunteered for the project.  During the design and facilitation of the training material, she made it her priority to understand the culture of the Philippines to ensure that the participants were comfortable and the communication between trainer and trainees was successful.  The result was a program that not only taught them how to do their jobs, but also one that respected their learning style while acknowledging that English is their second language. Because there would be no experienced support staff after the site officially opened in Manila, Crawford developed a training program that captured 100% of the definitions, processes and procedures that the participants would need to learn and understand to be able to do their jobs effectively (standard training programs contain 80% of the most frequently used job functions).  The technological portion of the program was also unique due to the site’s location and our inability to utilize our technology as we do in the U.S.  Crawford worked 6 days a week, 10 hours a day to produce this exceptional training program within the project deadline, while ensuring that it was of the highest quality.  When the design stage of the project was completed, Crawford traveled for 48 hours to Manila to deliver the training to our new associates.  The class was conducted during the overnight hours to accommodate the time difference and allow for technical resources in the U.S. to be available.  Crawford taught the class for eight hours each day; then worked with the U.S. technical and training teams to address concerns as needed; often for an additional 1-2 hours.  This extra step ensured that the learning process ran smoothly during the day and that the participants felt no impact.  One year later, the associates in Manila maintain a 98.69% accuracy rate.  Because the initial rollout and training was so successful, additional functionality has been transferred to Manila, resulting in a positive expense situation for JHSS.  The high accuracy and productivity rate of these associates has initiated a review throughout all of JHSS for additional work responsibilities that can be moved to Manila.  Crawford has also offered to return to Manila to facilitate additional training, should the company determine that it would be beneficial.Crawford’s exceptional performance on this project is not a one-time occurrence.  She focuses on the learner and their needs during every project and consistently produces high quality results.  The business units and her team rely on her as a knowledgeable, competent, supportive and cooperative resource.

She transferred to the Operations department in 2001 as a processor and, through a series of promotions, became the first Team Leader in our new site that opened in Tampa, Florida in March 2003.In 2004, Crawford joined the Training and Development team as a facilitator for the Tampa site.  At this time, she is responsible for developing, designing and facilitating TA training programs in Boston, MA, Tampa, FL, and Portsmouth, NH.  She is also responsible for mentoring new training associates, as well as maintaining collaborative relationships with our business partners.Crawford has been the recipient of the JHSS President’s Award (2004) and the JH Special Award (2007).
