Acquisition king
															C. Dean Metropoulos - and sons
C. Dean Metropoulos is among the Grand Marshals of this year’s Greek Independence Day Parade in New York City and a classic rags-to-riches story of an immigrant son who made good.
by Dimitri C. Michalakis
“I’m in the acquisition business,” says C. Dean Metropoulos simply. “And I love it. I love finding opportunities, negotiating the deals, repositioning the businesses, many of which are troubled, though many are not. Even with healthy companies, you can still find wonderful ways to make them grow organically or via strategic add-on acquisitions. There are many opportunities out there that need energy, focused hands-on management and financial expertise.”
And in 25 years of deal-making (the majority in consumer product companies: “I like basic industries that I can understand and I can contribute to”), Metropoulos has earned a sterling reputation in the private equity investment world. He’s made over 68 “acquisitions” over those years involving $12 billion of invested capital. The Morningstar Group was acquired for $1 billion in 1996, International Home Foods for close to $3 billion in 2000 and taken public and Hillsdown Holdings for $4 billion that same year. In 2004, his Greenwich, Connecticut-based CDM Group acquired Pinnacle Foods, which owns a bundle of venerable brands such as Aunt Jemima, Duncan Hines, Log Cabin, Swanson frozen dinners, Armour canned meats, Lender’s bagels, Celeste Pizza, Mrs. Paul’s seafood and Van De Kamp’s, among others. Pinnacle was sold to Blackstone in 2007.

“If we’re proud of anything, it’s that no one has ever lost money with us,” says the 60-year-old acquisitions maven, who says he’s generated an average 44% return for himself and his various banking and financial partners. “No one has ever been disappointed. You can talk to JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, or Bank of America and the feedback will be one of consistent respect. Integrity and performance is how they define CDM & Co. Our integrity is everything. I always say that to the boys, and their mother reinforces it stronger than I do.”

His wife of 30 years is Marianne (now producing a movie and a founder of the “Campaign to End Childhood Hunger” and Paul Newman’s “Hole in the Wall Gang” cancer camps) and the boys are his sons Evan, 27, and Daren, 24, who have been principals in his various enterprises since they were barely old enough to peer over the conference table at their father’s various companies. 
“My two sons have tremendous creative ideas on how to resurrect iconic brands that have been around for a very long time but have lost their competitive appeal,” says their father proudly. “They bring fresh, guerilla-marketing ideas and outside-the-box thinking. They push me harder than I’d like to be pushed, but they challenge me and often change my views.”

Evan graduated high school at 16 and was the youngest MA intern at Deutsche Bank’s London office and together with his brother was advising his father right from the start. Metropoulos loves to tell stories about their business prescience and what he calls their “wonderful virgin views and perceptions.”
“Chef Boyardee was a wonderful $600 million iconic brand which they helped me recreate,” he recounts with relish. “My wife Marianne and I were driving up to Boston from Greenwich and the boys were 14 and 16 years old at the time. While on Route 95, they saw a WWF billboard on the side of the road and one of my sons says, ‘Dad, is that WWF?’ I wasn’t sure. But when we get back to the office on Monday, Evan takes one of my senior VPs of marketing, a professional who makes a couple of million dollars a year, and he says to him, ‘Let’s go visit WWF.’ So they go down to WWF headquarters and my son tells the receptionist there, ‘I’d like to see Vince McMahon. We own a company called International Home Foods, which includes things like Chef Boyardee, and we want to do a deal with him.’ Now remember, International Home Foods, at the time, was a $3 billion dollar business. And Vince McMahon, the owner of WWF, is a very commercial animal.”
McMahon’s wife Linda, president of WWF, came out to the talk to the youngest business executive and he convinced her to strike a deal with International Home Foods. “Dad,” Evan told his father later, “this is a perfect demographic for this product. All these people who watch WWF, they’re great consumers for Chef.”
“So,” his father concludes, “we got into this very financially-attractive relationship where WWF would market our product and also shoot our ads. American Home Products, which had previously owned the brand, would spend $800 million shooting product ads, but with WWF, which has an in-house production company, we spent barely $200,000. And we got to use people like The Rock, Cold Stone, Mankind and get featured at all their internationally televised events. That was a phenomenal thing.”
Another phenomenal thing, he hurries to relate, was the Gulden’s Mustard deal with Jennifer Aniston proposed by the boys.
“Evan had gone to the Ionian Village in Greece and there he met Jennifer Aniston’s cousin from Philadelphia,” Metropoulos tells the story. “And Jennifer and Kevin Bacon were shooting a movie called Picture Perfect. In the movie, Jennifer plays a young advertising executive coming out of graduate school, working for Kevin Bacon and trying to sell him on how she was going to put a big campaign behind a brand. My son read this and through the Aniston cousin he met at the Ionian Village he got in touch with Jennifer Aniston’s agent and we got the name of Gulden’s Mustard in that movie for nothing: as the brand that Jennifer was pushing on Kevin Bacon. It became part of the plot. Forty-three minutes of that movie featured Gulden’s Mustard. You can’t buy that kind of advertising!”
Then there was the boys’ coup with Bumble Bee tuna, which their father had acquired (and which Evan headed as president at 17 and Daren at 14—“That’s a $700 million company!” their father exclaims).
“And one day my wife was driving up to the Greenwich school here and the boys were listening to the radio talk show host Howard Stern,” he tells that story. “And Howard mentioned somewhere in these wisecracks that his mother never fed him, so he’d always come home and open up a can of Bumble Bee tuna and that was his favorite meal. When Evan heard that, he comes home from school and he calls the station and he says, ‘My name is Evan Metropoulos. I’m the president of Bumble Bee Tuna’—he didn’t tell him how old he was—‘And I’d like to come and talk to you about advertising the brand on the show.’ So Evan goes with his brother Daren plus two of our attorneys and when they get there the boys were 16 and 14 and they sit in a conference room and they make a deal to advertise Bumble Bee tuna on Howard Stern. And it was a very attractive deal and Howard would pitch it all the time and the boys became his favorite guests. But I told them, ‘Boys, you let him suck you into sexual stuff and I’m going to pull the plug.”
Then there’s the story of how their father acquired Perrier Jouet champagne and the boys made it the cool and “in” champagne for the young affluent market by having their friends in the entertainment industry feature it in their videos and concerts. “Snoop Dog, Limp Bizkit, all of them, the boys would donate the champagne and when these guys did their concerts and videos they would open up our champagne. In fact, it was even worked into some of their lyrics. And it became a very hot little brand.”
Metropoulos is justifiably proud of his sons’ business prowess and loves to talk about it, but then again he was no slouch himself as a business wunderkind.
Born in Greece, he came to America at nine when his father came looking for a better future for his children. “And he made a very great sacrifice, like many immigrants before them. My parents both worked very, very hard and I pause at least once a day, because I lead a good life, and I say none of this would be possible if it wasn’t for the tremendous sacrifices by my mom and dad, Katerina and Jimmy. They are blessed people.”
The family lived in Watertown, Massachusetts, where Jimmy Metropoulos worked at the Star Market and later owned a restaurant in Newton called Cabot. Metropoulos went to college on a scholarship, and after graduate school at Babson and a year-and-a-half towards his doctorate at Columbia, he went to work for GTE.
“I worked for this wonderful company called GTE, which is now Verizon, and I was 24 years old, and I lived in Europe, Paris, Hong Kong, Geneva and London, and in my 20s I was running the international business as the youngest senior VP in the company’s history and I loved it,” he rhapsodizes still. “We had joint ventures in Argentina, Mexico, India, Japan and operated in 62 different countries. And I fell into a situation on my first deal where I bought a very small business in Europe and it turned out to be very successful and it got me into the acquisition business.”
That first acquisition was a company based in Italy and Belgium that manufactured space heaters and air conditioners and, he says, “I bought that business with all the money I ever had, plus I sold this beautiful factory which was worth about $58 million to a real estate family in Italy, I sold it for $42, so I could use the money to buy the company.”
The price tag of that first acquisition was $72 million and for a time the young executive had his hands full trying to keep up the cash flow and the company solvent. Until one day he was flying back to the States for a Greek wedding and he happened to sit next to a Honeywell executive in charge of the company’s joint ventures in Europe.
“And I said to him, Who makes all the frames for Honeywell? And he said, We subcontract most of that stuff out. And I said, Gee, I have a wonderful company that can do that for you. And he said, Well, next time you go back over there I’ll introduce you to my colleagues and I’ll suggest to them that they give you guys a trial. I said, I’m taking the flight right back. He said, You’re gonna go back? I thought you were going to a wedding? I said, No I’m going right back. And I apologized to the groom and the bride and I flew back and got the order from this guy and it became a big part of our business.”
C. Dean Metropoulos & Co has grown considerably since then, and the deals now average in the billions and multi-billions, but at 60, Metropoulos says he still has the same zest for the deal and still looks for the opportunity “to grow a company” which he always did. “And if I think that I bring something to that equation of growing it financially and successfully then I go for it. If I don’t think I bring something to that equation I avoid it.”
And of course now his sons are part of the equation and the partnership works both ways.
“I respect them because they do push me harder than I’ve ever been pushed,” he admits. “They’re very bright and very creative. But I tell them to root all their decisions on business fundamentals and have integrity and compassion above all. And we all agree, if you don’t enjoy what you’re doing, don’t do it. We all love what we’re doing and we love working with each other.”

Early life[edit]
Metropoulos was ten years old when he and his parents emigrated from Greece to the US[3] and came to Watertown, Massachusetts.[2]
Metropoulos has a bachelor's degree and an MBA from the private business school Babson College, located in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
At age 25, he went to Geneva, Switzerland, to become a financial director for GTE International’s (now Verizon) European, Middle Eastern and African operations. Later he returned to the U.S. as the company’s youngest controller.[2]
Career[edit]
Some of the buy-build private equity transactions of Metropoulos have included Pinnacle Foods, Ghirardelli Chocolate Company, International Home Foods, Pabst Brewing Company, The Morningstar Group, Inc. (sold to Suiza Foods[5] which has become Dean Foods) and Solar Marine ("a private, European based, international dry cargo shipping company"[6]) and Mumm's/Perrier-Jouët champagnes.[7]
Metropoulos is the executive chairman and chief executive officer of C. Dean Metropoulos & Company. The company was founded in 1993 and is based in Greenwich, Connecticut.[8] As of 2011, C. Dean Metropoulos & Co. has been involved in over 72 acquisitions with over $12 billion in invested capital.[7] The company jointly owns Hostess Brands along with Apollo Global Management.
In September 2014 American entrepreneur Eugene Kashper, backed by TSG Consumer Partners, announced an agreement to acquire Pabst Brewing from C. Dean Metropoulos & Co for $700 million.[9][10] The sale represented a gain of $550 million more than what the company paid for it in 2010. Bumble Bee Tuna is another brand owned by a company "bought and flipped" by the firm.[11]
On July 7, 2015 there were rumors of a Hostess Brands IPO. Metropoulos has stated that there is no plan for an IPO.[12] In July 2016, a Hostess IPO was announced.
Personal life[edit]
He lives in Palm Beach, Florida, with his wife[3] Marianne, who in 2011 was President and Principal of Aegean Entertainment, a movie production company in Beverly Hills. They are parents of sons Evan and Daren.[7] Daren, age 33 in early 2017 and a principal in C. Dean Metropoulos & Company,[8] purchased the Playboy mansion for $100 million in 2016.[13]

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By Drew Harwell  By Drew Harwell   October 30, 2014  Follow @drewharwell     When Pabst Brewing, the lowbrow beer house behind Old Milwaukee and Colt 45, went on the market in 2010, few expected its new buyer would have the industrialist poise or presidential hairline of billionaire dealmaker C. Dean Metropoulos.  The 68-year-old investor was one of America’s richest men, a star of the private-equity world prone to high-minded disquisitions on global sustainability. Pabst was the musty dive-bar maker of some of the cheapest beers ever canned. But under Metropoulos’s control, the 170-year-old brewer continued its streak of remarkable growth: Sales climbed 35 percent in three years, to 350 million liters of beer a year. Then last month, Metropoulos surprised again: He would sell Pabst, four years after buying, for nearly $500 million in profit. Metropoulos had done it again. The veteran turnaround artist has built his livelihood on scooping up crestfallen brands and preparing them for new success — or at least a profitable resale. By those conquests, he has accrued a net worth of $2.1 billion. Dubbed “Mr. Shelf Space” for his dominance of the lucrative American grocery aisles, he has, over three decades, revived brands as distinct as Bumble Bee, Duncan Hines, Vlasic, Ghirardelli, Hungry-Man and Chef Boyardee. His masterstroke: as the savior who last year rescued Twinkies from the trash bin of history.    (Beverage Information Group)  Yet Metropoulos’s Pabst deal was different in one important way. To lead the beer giant, he tapped his sons, who, unlike their decorous father, were known largely for their fast-talking, party-boy gloss: Daren, 31, who bought an $18 million mansion from Hugh Hefner, and Evan, 33, who a decade ago told a New York Times reporter, “I’ve been with more chicks than any fat guy you know, except Pavarotti.” Even before they unveiled any changes for the vintage brewery, the family’s legacy had some Pabst die-hards on edge. The brothers, San Francisco blogger Zach Perkins wrote in 2010, “are about as far from both hipster and blue collar (the demographics that keep PBR profitable) as they could possibly be.” Now, as Metropoulos and his sons close their latest turnaround, many in the beer world have wondered: How did they pull it off? And what quarry are they eyeing next? Neither Dean Metropoulos nor his sons would talk extensively with The Washington Post before the closing of the Pabst deal, planned for early November. The Metropoulos playbook, for all its success, is deceptively simple: Buy a well-known brand that has, as Dean told Leaders Magazine, lost its “mojo;” re-energize it with new packaging, maybe, or a high-profile ad campaign; sell the newly hyped brand for a handsome profit; repeat. The strategy works, Metropoulos says, because he can think more creatively and devote more attention to a brand’s future than its overextended conglomerate owners could. “We move quickly,” Dean told Time magazine last year. “We don’t like to be slowed down with analytics or bureaucracy.” A farmer’s son who emigrated from Greece at age 9, Metropoulos made his first corporate deal in his 20s, buying a European maker of space heaters and air conditioners with, as he told Greek American magazine Neo, “all the money I ever had.” He later made a series of profitable acquisitions for a Vermont specialty-cheese company.   Mega-investor C. Dean Metropoulos made billions reviving stale brands. Then his party-loving sons joined in. (Handout/Handout)  As his profile grew, big investment banks and private-equity giants began trusting him with their money in hopes he’d find the next big thing. Many of the gold mines were one-time middle-America favorites largely abandoned on store shelves. In 1996, for example, he and a Dallas buyout firm gathered $1.3 billion to buy International Home Foods, the keeper of little lunch staples such as Chef Boyardee canned pasta and Bumble Bee tuna. Four years later, they sold it to ConAgra, comfortably doubling their money. His targets, he told Time, were mostly nostalgia brands, household names that “no matter how badly they’ve been mismanaged, cannot be killed over time.” So last year, he found a match in Twinkies, teaming up with a private-equity firm and paying more than $400 million to buy the dessert icon out from Hostess Brands’ bankruptcy. The new owners returned the snack cakes to shelves, but they also dramatically changed production lines to enhance efficiencies. One 84-year-old bakery in suburban Chicago, which employed 400 factory workers, was reopened only to close a year later. Despite that, “The Sweetest Comeback in the History of Ever,” as Twinkies’ marketing called it, tapped into a national nostalgia for unapologetic junk-food cravings and appeared to pen a happy ending on a story of big business gone wrong. It also canonized Metropoulos with a level of public goodwill most billionaire buyout kings could only dream of. When Metropoulos bought Pabst for $250 million in cash in 2010, it appeared a similar success was afoot. The brand boasted its fast-growing flagship Pabst Blue Ribbon, regional favorites (Lone Star in Texas, National Bohemian in Baltimore, Rainier in the Pacific Northwest) and a series of vintage, smoky stalwarts (Colt 45, Old Milwaukee, Schaefer, Stroh’s, Schlitz). “Each one of them has a story,” he said in a Bloomberg News interview. “People yearn to go back to some of our heritage.” This time, he put his sons in charge. Metropoulos had been grooming them for years to be heirs to his creative legacy, calling them “game changers” for their youthful familiarity with social media and brand-building. In 2000, when Evan Metropoulos was featured on MTV’s “True Life: I’m the Youngest Tycoon in the World,” he bragged of working on multimillion-dollar sponsorship deals as a college freshman between commutes to class in his Humvee. Three years later, when his father bought a $10.9 million luxury hotel called the Castle overlooking the Hudson River, he gave ownership positions to his sons, then 20 and 22. Under the family’s ownership, Pabst shed its famous resistance to advertising with some off-the-wall attempts at viral marketing. To promote the Pacific Northwest-based beer Olympia, it offered $1 million last year to “anyone who can ensure the safe capture of Bigfoot.” Pabst also tapped big celebrity cameos: rapper Snoop Dogg in a white fur coat promoting a potent, fruity “alcopop,” Blast by Colt 45; actor Will Ferrell in a series of inscrutable low-budget Old Milwaukee ads that aired only in tiny TV markets before taking off online. One of those Old Milwaukee ads, which aired in North Platte, Neb., during the Super Bowl, proved wildly successful not just for the volume of public chatter it inspired, but for its frugality: While other companies paid $3.5 million for 30-second game-day spots, theirs was watched more than 3 million times on YouTube and cost about $1,500. Sometimes the Metropoulos mojo was a little much. After he bought Pabst, Metropoulos reportedly told top staffers he wanted to pull Old Style, “Chicago’s Beer Since 1902,” out of a deal as the ballpark beer for Wrigley Field in order to spend more on promoting Old Style Light, according to the Chicago Tribune. When Cubs fans revolted, the firm changed its mind. The takeover of Pabst was not universally loved within its headquarters, which the brothers moved from its Chicago suburb to Los Angeles, near where they lived. Dozens of Pabst employees defected, and some top executives spoke bitterly about their new owners, who they said belittled and overloaded employees with impulsive, oddball ideas. “No one at Pabst had ever screamed obscenities into the phone before (Daren and Evan). . . . They were trying to manage through fear and aggression,” said Bryan Cook, 36, a Pabst field marketing representative who worked there six years before quitting in 2012. “They were 20-something billionaires whose dad had bought them a new toy.” If there was tension between the brothers and their father, they’ve hidden it well. Dean Metropoulos said his sons “have been critical to me,” crediting “their energy and their different way of thinking in connecting with young millennial consumers.” The brothers filled social media with photos of celebrities at brand parties and a blog with tributes to “awesome” old PBR ads. During a TV interview in a convenience store, Evan Metropoulos shifted a six-pack of PBR in front of a competitor in the cooler case, leading his brother to joke, “This is how you position the brands.” Yet their guerrilla marketing did little to help some of Pabst’s flagging brands. Shipments of Old Milwaukee cases dropped 23 percent in the two years after Will Ferrell’s first ads, according to the Beverage Information Group, an alcohol-industry research firm. In 2013, two years after Snoop Dogg’s endorsement of Blast by Colt 45, the drink still sold less than Schlitz. The brothers also struggled to match their father’s well-honed public polish. At age 25, Daren bought a sprawling manor next to the Playboy Mansion, a palatial home they later staged for Snoop Dogg’s 41st birthday party. “Let’s be honest,” Evan Metropoulos told Howard Stern last year. “I don’t have to work.” Pabst’s pending sale to a little-known partnership — including a Cyprus-based investor, Oasis Beverages, with breweries in Russia — led some Pabst lovers to worry over a betrayal of the beer’s all-American roots. It also contradicted some of the brothers’ early public wishes for the brand.  Calling Pabst “a trophy property . . . we’ll own for the rest of our lives,” they belittled foreign beer ownership during a 2010 interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. Evan even imagined berating a non-customer: “Shame on you for drinking Bud Light! What the hell are you drinking that for? To support some foreigners?” So why did the Metropoulos family sell? Short turnarounds are a Metropoulos trademark, and the potential for a half-billion dollars in profit probably didn’t hurt. Pabst’s brands, as with American brewers in general, also faced rising competition from craft beers, spirits and wine. “Maybe what they decided to do,” said Adam Rogers of the Beverage Information Group, “was get out while the getting was good.” What’s next? The Metropoulos family has been open about wanting to buy a pro football team, and their names have emerged in talks for the Oakland Raiders, the Jacksonville Jaguars and, this year, the Buffalo Bills. Dean Metropoulos said “other deals are coming along soon enough,” but would not hint as to what. Whatever they are, his sons will likely come along for the ride. “We make so many acquisitions,” Metropoulos told an interviewer, “it’s easy not to step on each other’s feet.”             business economy      false after3th true          Please provide a valid email address.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
