Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

George O'Leary


Obituary
Condolences


































 O'LearyGeorge Michael O'Leary ended his struggle against Alzheimer's and died peacefully on Monday, July 25th, 2011. George was born on January 10, 1931 in Houston Texas and is the son of Katherine Cavanaugh O'Leary and George P. O'Leary, both deceased. George left Houston to live in the Texas Hill Country at the age of 7 due to asthma, and attended San Antonio Military Academy, Moye Military Academy, and finally attended public school in the town of Medina, Texas while living on his father's nearby ranch. He returned to Houston after the death of his mother at age 14 and attended St. Anne's Catholic School and St. Thomas High School. During his teenage years, he taught tennis at River Oaks Country Club. Subsequently, he attended Virginia Military Institute and graduated from University of Houston with a BS in geology. After graduation, he worked for his father's company, HOMCO, where he learned the basics of the oil industry, including directional drilling which was in its infancy in those days. He went on to establish a successful career in sales of oilfield materials and supplies. He was a member of St. Anne's Catholic Church where he was an alter server as a child. He also served as a Director of River Oaks Country Club. George was a passionate tennis player, golfer and hunter. His other love was raising cattle and waging war against mesquite. After retirement, he volunteered at St. Joseph Hospital greeting visitors with his warm smile. Later he was a participant at The Amazing Place. Proud of his Irish Heritage, George had the gift of gab and enjoyed bantering with friends and family. He was known for his outgoing personality and never met a stranger. George is survived by his wife of 59 years, Joan Davis O'Leary; his six children, Kathleen Moore and husband Henry, George Michael O'Leary Jr. and wife Lisa, Tom Davis O'Leary and wife Vivian, David Parker O'Leary and wife Sarah, Patrick Martin O'Leary and wife Molly, and Mark Cavanaugh O'Leary and wife Rachel; thirteen grandchildren Catherine Moore Thompson and husband Skylar, Laura Moore, George M. O'Leary III and wife Lesley, Patrick Conner O'Leary, Mary Elizabeth O'Leary, Tom Davis O'Leary, Grace Margaret O'Leary, Evan Edward O'Leary, John Clay O'Leary, Parker Gray O'Leary, Davis Donovan O'Leary, Ryan Cavanaugh O'Leary, and Megan Caroline O'Leary; his sister Katherine O'Leary Rogerson; brother John Cavanaugh O'Leary and wife Francis; brother-in-law Tom Martin Davis, Jr. and wife Jan; sister-in-law Nina Davis Gray and husband Elisha; and numerous nieces and nephews. The family is grateful to Dr. Gerardo Bueso, Houston Hospice, The Amazing Place and caregivers Marie Saunders and Lynette Saunders, and to long time employees Raphaela Flores and her son Edgar. A funeral mass will be held on Wednesday, July 27th at 10 am; St. Anne's Catholic Church, with burial to follow at a later date at Glenwood Cemetery. The family will receive friends and family at home on Tuesday from 6 to 8 pm. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Joan and George O'Leary Scholarship Fund, St Anne's School, 2140 Westheimer Road, Houston TX 77098; or to The Amazing Place, 3735 Drexel, Houston TX 77027. Online tributes may be posted at www.bradshawcarter.com.
