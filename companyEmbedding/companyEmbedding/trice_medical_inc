Trice Medical Receives FDA 510(k) Clearance for mi-eye



Share Article


















Diagnostic arthroscopy product provides valuable alternative to time consuming, indefinite and expensive diagnosis modes; eliminates false reads of indirect modalities such as MRIs







Trice Medical

The FDA clearance of mi-eye is a key milestone in Trice Medical’s pursuit of needle based diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. The company will also apply for CE Mark in Europe and approval in many countries outside the U.S.


King of Prussia, PA (PRWEB)
September 16, 2014
 King of Prussia, PA, September 16, 2014 – Trice Medical™, a private diagnostics company focused on micro invasive technologies, announced that it received 510(k) regulatory clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for its new device, mi-eye™.
mi-eye is designed to provide a more immediate, definitive and less expensive diagnosis, eliminating the false reads of indirect modalities, such as MRIs. mi-eye is a fully disposable, single-use, streamlined visualization device that uses a standard 14-gauge needle with an integrated camera and light source to perform a diagnostic arthroscopy—all while in the physician’s office during the initial consultation. A separate LCD tablet, running on Android OS, is attached via a data cable from the mi-eye needle. mi-eye is delivered to customers in sterile packaging and ready for immediate use.
Jeff O’Donnell, Chairman and CEO of Trice Medical, commented, “The FDA clearance of mi-eye is a key milestone in Trice Medical’s pursuit of needle based diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. The company will also apply for CE Mark in Europe and approval in many countries outside the U.S.”
Trice Medical intends to execute a limited marketing launch beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014. The company is currently building inventory and developing marketing tools and educational programs in preparation for the launch. 
In conjunction with the achievement of this regulatory milestone, Trice Medical received the balance of the cash related to its $11.6M Series B financing, which was led by Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. (NYSE:SFE).
About Trice MedicalTM
Trice was founded to fundamentally improve orthopedic diagnostics for the patient, physician, and payer by providing instant, eyes-on, answers. Trice has pioneered fully integrated camera-enabled needle technologies that provide a clinical solution that is optimized for the physician’s office. Trice’s mission is to provide more immediate and definitive patient care, eliminating the false reads associated with current indirect modalities and significantly reduce the overall cost to the healthcare system.

Trice Medical Receives FDA 510(K) Clearance for mi-Eye 2
Oct 6 16
Trice Medical announced that it received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for mi-eye 2, a disposable needle with a fully integrated camera that enables physicians to use advanced diagnostic imaging to visualize joint injuries in their clinic. The mi-eye 2 is designed for use in diagnostic and operative arthroscopic and endoscopic procedures to provide illumination and visualization of an interior cavity of the body through either a natural or surgical opening. The mi-eye 2 also provides physicians the ability to inject or aspirate under direct visualization. The mi-eye 2 is Trice Medical's second, next-generation FDA-cleared patented technology, which includes improvements that significantly enhance the mi-eye's resolution, field of view, depth of field and overall visualization. The mi-eye 2 provides a diagnostic modality for every patient, and can provide time-savings to the patient by eliminating the multiple visits associated with an MRI. The mi-eye 2 is unlike any other in-office arthroscopy device on the market now, and provides unparalleled optics with the ease of use of a needle.

Trice Medical, which has developed technology that allows doctors to diagnose orthopedic injuries in their office, has raised an additional $6.5 million in a private equity financing.
The King of Prussia, Pa., medical device company has now raised a total of $18 million through the series B financing, which was led by Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (NYSE: SFE) of Wayne, Pa.

In September, Trice received Food and Drug Administration approval for its Mi-eye product. Mi-eye is a fully disposable, single-use, visualization device. It features a standard 14-gauge needle with an integrated camera and light source that allows doctors to perform diagnostic arthroscopies in their office during an initial patient consultation.




Jeff O'Donnell, chairman and CEO of Trice Medical, said the device was created to help doctors diagnose orthopedic injuries faster and more cost effectively. The device also eliminates false reads that can occur with other types of diagnostic tests, such as an MRI.
O'Donnell said the company is already marketing the device in a small number of markets to get feedback from key physicians in preparation for a national launch in May.
The company plans to use the proceeds from the financing to fund two clinical trials to further show the efficacy of Mi-eye.
"We are also going to hire clinical specialists to work out in the field supporting the independent distributors we are using," he said. "And we also want to streamline our manufacturing process."
O'Donnell said the additional funding came from an investor, whom he did not identify, who contacted Trice after it had closed its 11.6M series B financing last July.

FAQs





How will the integration of mi-eye 2 affect my practice flow?
Trice Medical has effective best practices that can result in no interruption to your normal practice flow. Additionally, our Clinical Specialists will work with your practice to ensure the smoothest integration of mi-eye technology.


Who are the ideal mi-eye 2 patients?
mi-eye 2 is ideal for patients that are not candidates for an MRI such as those with claustrophobia, pacemakers, metal implants, obesity or anxiety. In addition, mi-eye 2 is ideal for patients that want an immediate answer to what is causing their pain, however, mi-eye 2 should not be used in instances where there is an active infection.


Do patients have any issues tolerating a 2.2mm-gauge needle?
Patients have tolerated the procedure very well, with most reporting little to no pain. It is important to note that every patient is different, and pain may be variable. We recommend an injection of local anesthetic prior to the mi-eye 2 procedure to help eliminate any unnecessary pain or discomfort.
