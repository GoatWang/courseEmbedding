Copyright © 2017 Manifold Fund Advisors, LLC
Information found on this site is directed to U.S. Investors.
All investments involve risk including the loss of principal. Investing in a single-sector mutual fund involves greater risk and potential reward than investing in a more diversified fund. By concentrating on a small number of holdings, the fund carries greater risk because each investment has a greater effect on the fund’s overall performance. The return of principal in bond funds is not guaranteed. Bond funds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the fund. Generally, the value of a bond fund rises when interest rates fall and falls when interest rates rise. 
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of a Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Portfolio diversification and active risk management do not assure a profit or protect against losses in a declining market. 
Investing in the Funds involves risk. Equity securities are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments. The Funds may invest in small and mid-cap securities which are more volatile than large cap stocks. Value-based investments are subject to the risk that the broad market may not recognize their intrinsic value. Investments in fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risks. The principal value of a bond falls when interest rates rise and rises when interest rates fall. During periods of rising interest rates, the value of a bond investment is at greater risk than during periods of stable or falling rates.
General ETF Risk. The cost to a shareholder of investing in the Fund may be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETF shares and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in equities. You will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the ETFs in addition to the Fund’s direct fees and expenses.
Foreign Securities Risk. International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or smaller capital markets.
Quantitative Investment Strategies Risk. Manifold Partners may rely on quantitative models (both proprietary models developed by Manifold Partners and those supplied by third parties) and information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”) in managing the Fund. Models and Data are used to assist in determining investments and to provide risk management insights.
Models and Data may prove to be incorrect or incomplete. In such cases, any decisions made in reliance thereon can expose the Fund to potential risks. Some of the models used by Manifold Partners are predictive in nature. Predictive models generally depend on the assumption that the future performance of a specific investment can be predicted based on the correlation of the past performance of the investment with the past performance of other investments or economic or financial data. The use of predictive models presents inherent risks. Because predictive models are usually constructed based on historical data supplied by third parties, the success of relying on such models may depend heavily on the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical data. Additionally, market dynamics change over time and correlations that existed in the past may diminish or end. A model may fail to provide correct predictions, and a model that has been successful in the past may be less successful or ineffective in the future. Most statistical formulae cannot fully match the complexity of the financial markets and a model may be flawed or may not work as anticipated. During unforeseen or low probability scenarios, models may produce unexpected results, which may result in losses for the Fund. 
Tracking Error Risk. ETFs typically trade on securities exchanges and their shares may, at times, trade at a premium or discount to their net asset values. In addition, an ETF may not replicate exactly the performance of the benchmark index it seeks to track for a number of reasons, including transaction costs incurred by the ETF, the temporary unavailability of certain index securities in the secondary market or discrepancies between the ETF and the index with respect to the weighting of securities or the number of securities held.
Emerging Markets Risk. The Fund may invest in foreign securities that may include securities of companies located in developing or emerging markets, which entail additional risks, including: less social, political and economic stability; smaller securities markets and lower trading volume, which may result in less liquidity and greater price volatility; national policies that may restrict securities investment opportunities, including restrictions on investments in issuers or industries, or expropriation or confiscation of assets or property; and less developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment.
Commodities Risk. Investments in commodities, such as gold, or in commodity-linked instruments, will subject the Global Tactical Allocation Fund's portfolio to volatility that may also deviate from price movements in equity and fixed income securities.
Equity Securities Risk. In general, prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities. The prices of equity securities fluctuate, and sometimes widely fluctuate, in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer, including general market, economic and political conditions.
For a complete list of fund risks, please see the prospectuses.
For more complete information on the American Independence and AI Funds, you can obtain a prospectus containing complete information for the Funds by calling 866.410.2006 or by visiting www.americanindependence.com. You should consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before you invest or send money. Information about these and other important subjects is in the Funds’ prospectus. The prospectus and, if available, the summary prospectus, should be read carefully before investing.

Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust 
      Authorizes a Rights Offering






December 09, 2010 04:10 PM Eastern Standard Time



RYE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Trustees of The Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust 
      (NYSE:GRX) (the “Fund”) has approved a transferable rights offering by 
      the Fund to its shareholders and authorized the filing of an initial 
      registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
      Key aspects of the rights offering, including the timing and the 
      pricing, have yet to be determined. The Board reserves the right to 
      delay or cancel the rights offering.
    

      The Fund believes a rights offering encourages long-term investors to 
      enhance their positions in the Fund. The proceeds from a rights offering 
      will allow the Fund to take advantage of new investment opportunities 
      without having to reduce existing holdings. Increasing the assets of the 
      Fund may also result in certain economies of scale which may lower the 
      Fund’s fixed expenses as a percentage of average net assets. 
      Transferable rights may trade on an exchange allowing non-subscribing 
      shareholders the option of selling their rights on the exchange or 
      through the transfer agent, generally at a low transaction cost.
    

      Under the proposed rights offering, each shareholder would receive one 
      right for each share held on the record date. At least three rights will 
      be required to acquire one additional share of the Fund. The 
      subscription price will be determined at a later date and is expected to 
      be below the market price at that time. Shareholders of record on the 
      record date for the rights offering are expected to be entitled to 
      oversubscribe, subject to certain limitations, for any shares not 
      purchased pursuant to the primary subscription rights. The record date 
      for the rights offering and the length of the offering period have not 
      yet been determined and will also be announced at a later date.
    

      Any rights offering will be made only by means of a prospectus and this 
      notice does not constitute an offer to sell any securities. The rights 
      are expected to be transferable and the Fund intends to apply for a New 
      York Stock Exchange listing. The information in this announcement is not 
      complete and is subject to change.
    

      The Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust is a 
      non-diversified, closed-end management investment company with $99 
      million in total net assets whose primary investment objective is 
      long-term growth of capital. The Fund is managed by Gabelli Funds, LLC, 
      a subsidiary of GAMCO Investors, Inc. (NYSE:GBL), which is a publicly 
      traded NYSE listed company.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing.  You can obtain more information about the Fund by calling 1-800-GABELLI (1-800-422-3554). The Fund's net asset value ("NAV") per share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio securities. Stocks are subject to market, economic, and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investors acquire shares of the Fund on a securities exchange at market value, which fluctuates according to the dynamics of supply and demand.  Leverage Risk. The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested, through the issuance of preferred shares, magnifies both the favorable and unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss.  Industry Concentration Risks. The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in companies in the healthcare and wellness industries, as a result, the value of the Fund’s shares will be more susceptible to factors affecting those particular types of companies, which may include, among others, governmental regulation, changes in government subsidy and reimbursement levels, the government approval process, rapid obsolescence of products and services and patent expirations. In addition, global demographic changes could have a positive or negative impact on the Fund’s shares.
