    See all 4 reviews5.0 out of 5 starsHonored To Be The First To Review (On Amazon) This Once and Future ClassicBytdb59on March 20, 2015Verified PurchaseThere's a lot of bogus negative reviews of this guitar (the 2015 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe) on the internet, but let me be the first to tell you:  Gibson knew what they were doing with this guitar. It looks like a centerfold, plays like a dream, and sounds amazing. There's something about the way the new wider neck fits your hand combined with the super low action of the strings that make it surprisingly easy to play and I swear my playing immediately got more accurate after about an hour of letting the muscle memory in my hands get used to the new neck. The new mini humbuckers are capable of sounding like anything from country twang or Chuck Berry chime to Pete Townsend humbuckers or Led Zeppelin snarl.  The new "G-Force" built in tuner works fantastic (IF you take the 2 or 3 minutes it takes to read the directions!!!) and is much faster and more covenient than the Snark I use on my other guitars. I've got a '79 Strat, an American Deluxe Strat, and a Memphis dot 335 all of which I love, but my new '015 Gold Top Les Paul Deluxe looks cooler, plays easier, and sounds better than any of 'em! I woul give it 10 stars if I could.11 comment|

                Gibson Custom is proud to announce the Limited release of the Rick Nielsen 1959 Les Paul Standard, a precise replica of the 'Burst that has been Rick's favorite stage and studio guitar since he acquired it over a quarter of a century ago. From the start, the foundation of one of rock and roll's most lasting legacies has been Rick Nielsen. The guitarist, writer and seemingly endless source of energy is known to the masses for his songsmith's prowess and guitar skills on stage and in the studio with Cheap Trick, but to guitarists, there's a whole other level of Rick's expertise. To those who love guitars and love to collect them, Rick is an authority on the instrument itself, known the world over as one of the most ambitious and knowledgeable guitar collectors.For the last 25 years, an original 1959 Les Paul has been along for the ride, flying precariously through the air in the hands of Rick Nielsen, who hasn't spent much time without it since the two found each other a quarter century ago. He's become so attached to the original that he insists on bringing it on the road, a demand that his road crew isn't too thrilled about. "It's a valuable guitar, so it takes up most of our insurance rider coverage," Rick observes with a laugh.So that Rick can travel with the authentic look, tone, and feel of his original, and so that a few players and collectors can enjoy an ownership experience to rival Rick's own, Gibson Custom has worked directly with Rick and his original 1959 Les Paul to replicate his original at a level of detail so fine that Rick himself put the prototype and the original side by side and declared the results "remarkable."Crafted to True Historic Specifications and offered in two finish options (Aged and Vintage Gloss), and with the first 50 hand-signed by the artist himself, the Rick Nielsen 1959 Les Paul Standard is available on a limited basis, with qualifying materials ultimately determining the size of the run.
            










                                True Historic Plastics and Details
                            
                            Based on lab analysis of original Gibson plastics from the 1950s, the plastics on the True Historic's including the Toggle Washer, Cream Jackplate, Cream Pickguard, Pickup Mounting Rings and Toggle Switch Cap have been reformulated and re-engineered to the original specifications of their vintage counterparts.

Smooth radiuses are found throughout the body as well as the most critical point, at the fretboard binding, which results in an immediately comfortable guitar with a broken in feel

                Gibson Custom is proud to announce the Limited release of the Rick Nielsen 1959 Les Paul Standard, a precise replica of the 'Burst that has been Rick's favorite stage and studio guitar since he acquired it over a quarter of a century ago. From the start, the foundation of one of rock and roll's most lasting legacies has been Rick Nielsen. The guitarist, writer and seemingly endless source of energy is known to the masses for his songsmith's prowess and guitar skills on stage and in the studio with Cheap Trick, but to guitarists, there's a whole other level of Rick's expertise. To those who love guitars and love to collect them, Rick is an authority on the instrument itself, known the world over as one of the most ambitious and knowledgeable guitar collectors.For the last 25 years, an original 1959 Les Paul has been along for the ride, flying precariously through the air in the hands of Rick Nielsen, who hasn't spent much time without it since the two found each other a quarter century ago. He's become so attached to the original that he insists on bringing it on the road, a demand that his road crew isn't too thrilled about. "It's a valuable guitar, so it takes up most of our insurance rider coverage," Rick observes with a laugh.So that Rick can travel with the authentic look, tone, and feel of his original, and so that a few players and collectors can enjoy an ownership experience to rival Rick's own, Gibson Custom has worked directly with Rick and his original 1959 Les Paul to replicate his original at a level of detail so fine that Rick himself put the prototype and the original side by side and declared the results "remarkable."Crafted to True Historic Specifications and offered in two finish options (Aged and Vintage Gloss), and with the first 50 hand-signed by the artist himself, the Rick Nielsen 1959 Les Paul Standard is available on a limited basis, with qualifying materials ultimately determining the size of the run.

                In 1984, when Vic DaPra  set out to acquire an original '59 Les Paul (ser# 9 0627), he didn't have the luxury of the internet. "I had to wait for Polaroid pictures to come through the mail. It felt like forever." Rarely does an original late '50s Gibson Les Paul make it to us with such clean lineage. The days of "closet" finds are quickly becoming the folklore of a bygone era. Unearthing one of the very few two-owner 1959 'Bursts with so much character in its top is incredible: this guitar is astounding, from the billowy, unending, multi-dimensional flame to the softly mellowed hue of its now caramel-colored burst.  Gibson Custom is excited to offer a very limited number of "Gruhn 'Burst" Les Pauls, hand-crafted featuring our True Historic features.  To bring you the specific tone and feel of Gruhn 'Burst, we've re-created its neck profile and top carve through digital analysis of the original and tone-matched its pickups with specially wound Custom Buckers. To capture the finite details of this very special Collector's Choice edition, the color and wear are hand-applied and based on in-depth study of the Gruhn 'Burst, with Vic's personal involvement in developing and approving the run.
            










                                True Historic Plastics
                            
                            Based on lab analysis of original Gibson plastics from the 1950s, the plastics on the True Historics including the Toggle Washer, Cream Jackplate, Cream Pickguard, Pickup Mounting Rings and Toggle Switch Cap have been reformulated and re-engineered to the original specifications of their vintage counterparts
                        







                                True Historic Pickup Covers
                            
                            Engineered and manufactured to capture every nuance and angle of original vintage pickup covers
                        







                                Double-Carved Top
                                
                            To capture the original top carve profile of Gruhn 'Burst, all Collector's Choice #35 are double carved by CNC, with the final shape of their dish arch perfected in a hand-sanding process
                        







                                Double-Carved Neck
                                
                            Based on digital scanning of Gruhn 'Burst to deliver the same profile and feel of the original
                        







                                "Broken" Peghead Edges
                                
                            Hand-sanded peghead, neck, and body edges beautifully capture the look and feel of the original in exceptional detail
                        







                                Thinner Peghead Veneer
                                
                            While you can't see it on a finished Les Paul, all Gibsons from the '50s had a thinner peghead veneer. All True Historic guitars, including Gurhn 'Burst feature this detail in their mission to be as close to the originals as possible
                        







                                Thinner True Historic Wet-Sanded Finish
                                
                            All True Historic guitars from Gibson are sprayed with thinner nitrocellulose finishes, as were original '50s guitars, and are now hand wet-sanded for beauty and authenticity.
                        







                                Hide Glue Top Construction
                                
                            Along with all hide glue neck construction, Gibson Custom extends the use of hot hide glue to join the back and top of every True Historic guitar, just as it was done in the 1950s
                        







                                Rolled Fingerboard Binding
                                
                            One of the most magical aspects of an original '50s Les Paul is its smooth, natural playing feel. We hand-file the fingerboard binding on every Gruhn 'Burst to capture that feel precisely
                        







                                Hand-Selected Flame Maple Top
                                
                            One of the factors limiting the number of Gruhn 'Burst available is its unique flame maple top.  To capture the same level of depth and character, Gibson Custom has been hand-selecting and setting aside qualifying Gruhn 'Burst top wood for nearly a year and continues to do so in hopes of offering more of these amazing 'Burst replicas

                In 1984, when Vic DaPra  set out to acquire an original '59 Les Paul (ser# 9 0627), he didn't have the luxury of the internet. "I had to wait for Polaroid pictures to come through the mail. It felt like forever." Rarely does an original late '50s Gibson Les Paul make it to us with such clean lineage. The days of "closet" finds are quickly becoming the folklore of a bygone era. Unearthing one of the very few two-owner 1959 'Bursts with so much character in its top is incredible: this guitar is astounding, from the billowy, unending, multi-dimensional flame to the softly mellowed hue of its now caramel-colored burst.  Gibson Custom is excited to offer a very limited number of "Gruhn 'Burst" Les Pauls, hand-crafted featuring our True Historic features.  To bring you the specific tone and feel of Gruhn 'Burst, we've re-created its neck profile and top carve through digital analysis of the original and tone-matched its pickups with specially wound Custom Buckers. To capture the finite details of this very special Collector's Choice edition, the color and wear are hand-applied and based on in-depth study of the Gruhn 'Burst, with Vic's personal involvement in developing and approving the run.
            










                                True Historic Plastics
                            
                            Based on lab analysis of original Gibson plastics from the 1950s, the plastics on the True Historics including the Toggle Washer, Cream Jackplate, Cream Pickguard, Pickup Mounting Rings and Toggle Switch Cap have been reformulated and re-engineered to the original specifications of their vintage counterparts
                        







                                True Historic Pickup Covers
                            
                            Engineered and manufactured to capture every nuance and angle of original vintage pickup covers
                        







                                Double-Carved Top
                                
                            To capture the original top carve profile of Gruhn 'Burst, all Collector's Choice #35 are double carved by CNC, with the final shape of their dish arch perfected in a hand-sanding process
                        







                                Double-Carved Neck
                                
                            Based on digital scanning of Gruhn 'Burst to deliver the same profile and feel of the original
                        







                                "Broken" Peghead Edges
                                
                            Hand-sanded peghead, neck, and body edges beautifully capture the look and feel of the original in exceptional detail
                        







                                Thinner Peghead Veneer
                                
                            While you can't see it on a finished Les Paul, all Gibsons from the '50s had a thinner peghead veneer. All True Historic guitars, including Gurhn 'Burst feature this detail in their mission to be as close to the originals as possible
                        







                                Thinner True Historic Wet-Sanded Finish
                                
                            All True Historic guitars from Gibson are sprayed with thinner nitrocellulose finishes, as were original '50s guitars, and are now hand wet-sanded for beauty and authenticity.
                        







                                Hide Glue Top Construction
                                
                            Along with all hide glue neck construction, Gibson Custom extends the use of hot hide glue to join the back and top of every True Historic guitar, just as it was done in the 1950s
                        







                                Rolled Fingerboard Binding
                                
                            One of the most magical aspects of an original '50s Les Paul is its smooth, natural playing feel. We hand-file the fingerboard binding on every Gruhn 'Burst to capture that feel precisely
                        







                                Hand-Selected Flame Maple Top
                                
                            One of the factors limiting the number of Gruhn 'Burst available is its unique flame maple top.  To capture the same level of depth and character, Gibson Custom has been hand-selecting and setting aside qualifying Gruhn 'Burst top wood for nearly a year and continues to do so in hopes of offering more of these amazing 'Burst replicas

Named after one of the 20th century's most important musicians and musical inventors, the Gibson Les Paul is quite possibly the most well-known and successful "signature model" of all time. Les Paul was not only a popular jazz and country guitarist, bandleader and TV show host, he also made significant contributions to the field of audio multi-track recording and musical electronics.A constant tinkerer and inventor, in the 1940s, Les set out to design a guitar that would sustain notes for far longer than the big hollow-bodied electric guitars that were commonly used in the middle of the 20th century. After considerable experimentation, Les determined that by anchoring the guitar strings to a solid piece of wood, sustain could be greatly increased, while simultaneously reducing the tendency for the guitar to feed back at higher volume levelsâ€“ which is a considerable issue with hollow-bodied guitars. When a prototype was presented to Gibson, they initially passed on the idea of a solid body guitar, but they soon changed their mind, and the Les Paul model was released in 1952.The original Goldtop model from 1952 featured a trapeze tailpiece, two single coil P-90 pickups with a separate volume and tone control for each pickup, a "set" or glued-in 24.75" scale mahogany neck, mahogany body with a thin maple top cap, and a distinctive "gold top" finish. Later models, such as the 1954 Custom model introduced features like the now-classic "tune-o-matic" bridge and fancier cosmetics. In 1957, the Seth Lover-designed "Patent Applied For" humbucker pickups were introduced. These pickups are "hotter" than the original P-90s, with a thicker and heavier sound, and are much less susceptible to hum and noise than the original single coils. The 1958, 1959 and 1960 Standards featured a distinctive sunburst finish over their often highly figured maple tops, and surviving examples of the originals are today among the most highly sought after and most expensive vintage guitar models in the world. In the mid-1950s, Gibson also broadened the LP line with the addition of the somewhat stripped down and less expensive Special and Junior models, and later did so again with the introduction of the mini-humbucker-equipped Deluxe in 1968 and the affordable Studio model in 1983.Today, Gibson is still making many different versions of the Les Paul in their Nashville USA factory. Long a favorite of blues and rock guitarists, it remains one of the best-selling and most popular guitars in the world, and has been associated with such artists as Slash, Mike Bloomfield, Duane Allman, Peter Green, Eric Clapton, Joe Perry and Jimmy Page.

Les Paul was one of the most legendary luthiers ever to take up the craft. In fact, it's safe to say that his fame is surpassed only by that of the guitar which still bears his name today. The original Les Paul guitar played a major role in creating rock and roll as we know it, and the Gibson Les Paul Studio instruments in this section certainly have what it takes to continue the tradition their ancestor started back in 1952. If you've been looking to add a historic guitar with a healthy dose of modern playability to your collection, then you've come to the right place: the Les Paul studio series is designed for no-nonsense quality and scorching performance that's easy to fit into any budget.

To get in on the ground floor of the Gibson Les Paul Studio lineup, check out the Les Paul Studio VG Flame Top Electric Guitar and the Les Paul Studio Pro Faded Electric Guitar. These are like the distilled essence of the Les Paul: all the tone you'd expect from the name, with simple appointments dedicated to studio artists as well as stage musicians with a flair for subtlety. These guitars feel and sound like a Les Paul Standard, but with a smaller price tag and modest, unassuming looks.

Of course, that's not to say that there isn't a Gibson Les Paul Studio option for those of us who like a little more flash on our guitars. All it takes to see that is one look at the Les Paul Studio Hot Rod Electric Guitar. True to the Studio series spirit, it's designed without too many unnecessary frills. But its eye-catching style, extra-thick body and powerful humbuckers take all the best things about the Les Paul Studio and turn them up to 11. Although its name says Studio, it's easy to see (and hear!) that the Hot Rod is equally at home on the stage.

So go ahead and take a look for the Gibson Les Paul Studio that's right for you. Whether you choose to go subtle, hot-rod it up, or find a happy medium with models like the Deluxe II '60s, there's bound to be a perfect axe for you somewhere in this section. And since every Les Paul is incredibly versatile, there's no riff that will be out of bounds for you and your new Gibson guitar.

Gibson Left-Handed Les Paul TraditionalThe left-handed Gibson Les Paul Standard Traditional has all the traditional features and fat, sweet snarling sound that you expect from a Les Paul, from the mahogany body and set neck to the pair of Gibson's awesome '57 Classic humbucker pickups. Gibson is pleased to announce that the Traditional is the first model to use the revolutionary PLEK system, a computer-controlled set-up that measures and dresses each fret, measuring the height between the fingerboard and each string, eliminating string buzz and providing ultimate playability. 

Features:- Vintage-style Gibson speed knobs
- Chrome Nashville Tune-O-Matic bridge and stopbar 
- Classic Kluson-style tuners by Tone Pros
- Gibson's standard black snakeskin case
- '57 Classic humbuckers in the neck and bridge
- Mahogany body and neck
- Carved maple top

                    "Great lefty Gibson"
            


                Sound:            

                Classic Les Paul tone. This guitar sounds AWESOME. Everybody in my band is blown away by its tone. Cuts through in the mid and high range very well with a tight low bottom end. Excellent tonal balance.            

                Feature:            

                Its old school Les Paul. I do not like the plastic tuners.            

                Ease of Use:            

                This guitar sounds great through a EVH 5153 or through a 5 watt practice amp. Plays excellent. No learning curve.            

                Quality:            

                Made in the USA. Gibson guitars will last a life time. Not sure about the plastic tuners and pick guard.            

                Value:            

                I was skeptical about the price verses quality. After receiving the guitar that went away.            

                Manufacturer Support:            

                Never had a reason to contact.            

                The Wow Factor:            

                Every guitar player should have Gibson Les Paul. Love them, hate them. It shouldn't matter. I am not the biggest Les Paul fan on the planet however I believe this guitar is going to make me a huge Les Paul fan. Very thick heavy tone!!!!!!!!            

                Overall:            

                Excellent guitar. Before I even plugged it in, I knew I had a winner. A guitar that sounds that great before even being plugged into an amp has to sound good and it does. I own several guitars. EVH, Ibanez, ESP, LTD, Ovation. They all have likes and dislikes. The Gibson Les Paul Traditional is just a big heavy tone monster!!!!!! I am not going to bore you with a bunch of details on the Gibson. It is heavy in weight for a guitar compared to others. I switched to a padded strap and that helps. I can stand at rehersal for five hours and be comfortable. The tone I get from this guitar is priceless. I got a very good deal on it from ZZSounds. I am very happy with the purchase!

                    "From a Jackson User"
            


                Sound:            

                The sound of this guitar is not as bright as I expected, but it did give very good and clear clean tones. The heavier riffs sound good to with the right volume and amp. Sustain was a little less than I expected, but a quick adjustment of the height of the pickups fixed that. The main problem is that once in tune, IT BUZZED. I had to make some adjustments but then it was fine. The pickups are definitely the most versatile I have heard to go through a variety of styles.            

                Feature:            

                Its pretty much what you would expect, it's a les paul so don't expect any bells and whistles. The volume and tone knobs are very responsive and just a little tweak makes a difference, although they go in reverse direction to what I'm used to for some reason. The main thing I want to say here is that the body is no where near as heavy as I expected. It is supposed to be weight relieved, not chambered, but it's not that much heavier to what I'm used to. If you are not used to a les paul neck, get ready to adjust. It's easier to me to chord, but much harder to solo.Again, I'm used to USA and japan Jacksons, so I knew this coming in. However, I definitely like the feel of the guitar's neck and the way it conforms to my hands. Just FYI, the binding is more of a cream than a white, and the case (made in Canada) is awesome.            

                Ease of Use:            

                Again, the neck and the upper fret access will be the biggest adjustment.            

                Quality:            

                First off, I'm a little biased because I don't mind paying a little more to keep American workers employed, but I did have one complaint on the construction. Everything is where it should be and the fretwork, tuners, finish, pickups, wood, and case were all fantastic, but there are 3 places where a razor blade cut into the binding on top and it is noticeable. This should not have been missed by any inspection checklist; it stands out. Everything else was top notch besides the strap buttons...way too small.            

                Value:            

                Even though I know I will get slammed, maybe cause I'm a ten year playing hobbyist and not a professional, I can't honestly say that there is a 1500 difference in this guitar and an Epi Custom I owned. A difference yes, but not that much of one other than the residual value. However, This is definitely a great buy over the Standard, .            

                Manufacturer Support:            

                Haven't dealt with them.            

                The Wow Factor:            

                The fact that you own something that will outlast you, and appreciate in value, is enough for me. Again, I was impressed with the versatility of the tones, the finish (ebony) and the tightness of the guitar. I was definitely wowed that it wasn't as heavy as what I expected, and I was wowed in a bad way on the cuts on the binding. The other appealing thing about this guitar is the price point is perfect, as standards are too expensive, fenders are a different breed, and USA Jackson's are nuts with their price increases.            

                Overall:            

                Just received my Left handed Les Paul Traditional. This is an early review because I want to offer people a perspective that are used to fast necks and comparing what you see in pictures to what you actually get

1. zZounds offers the industry‘s most musician-friendly payment plans

            zZounds offers a variety of Play as You Pay installment plans that allow you to get the gear you want today. While our competitors might offer house credit cards that require you to fill out an application and pass a credit check, our payment plans are easy to get, simple to use, and, best of all, accrue zero interest. Unlike those house credit cards that can leave you vulnerable to exorbitant interest charges once the promotional period ends, we never have and never will charge interest when you take advantage of one of the zZounds Play as You Pay plans.

Gibson Left-Handed Les Paul TraditionalThe left-handed Gibson Les Paul Standard Traditional has all the traditional features and fat, sweet snarling sound that you expect from a Les Paul, from the mahogany body and set neck to the pair of Gibson's awesome '57 Classic humbucker pickups. Gibson is pleased to announce that the Traditional is the first model to use the revolutionary PLEK system, a computer-controlled set-up that measures and dresses each fret, measuring the height between the fingerboard and each string, eliminating string buzz and providing ultimate playability. 

Features:- Vintage-style Gibson speed knobs
- Chrome Nashville Tune-O-Matic bridge and stopbar 
- Classic Kluson-style tuners by Tone Pros
- Gibson's standard black snakeskin case
- '57 Classic humbuckers in the neck and bridge
- Mahogany body and neck
- Carved maple top

                    "Great lefty Gibson"
            


                Sound:            

                Classic Les Paul tone. This guitar sounds AWESOME. Everybody in my band is blown away by its tone. Cuts through in the mid and high range very well with a tight low bottom end. Excellent tonal balance.            

                Feature:            

                Its old school Les Paul. I do not like the plastic tuners.            

                Ease of Use:            

                This guitar sounds great through a EVH 5153 or through a 5 watt practice amp. Plays excellent. No learning curve.            

                Quality:            

                Made in the USA. Gibson guitars will last a life time. Not sure about the plastic tuners and pick guard.            

                Value:            

                I was skeptical about the price verses quality. After receiving the guitar that went away.            

                Manufacturer Support:            

                Never had a reason to contact.            

                The Wow Factor:            

                Every guitar player should have Gibson Les Paul. Love them, hate them. It shouldn't matter. I am not the biggest Les Paul fan on the planet however I believe this guitar is going to make me a huge Les Paul fan. Very thick heavy tone!!!!!!!!            

                Overall:            

                Excellent guitar. Before I even plugged it in, I knew I had a winner. A guitar that sounds that great before even being plugged into an amp has to sound good and it does. I own several guitars. EVH, Ibanez, ESP, LTD, Ovation. They all have likes and dislikes. The Gibson Les Paul Traditional is just a big heavy tone monster!!!!!! I am not going to bore you with a bunch of details on the Gibson. It is heavy in weight for a guitar compared to others. I switched to a padded strap and that helps. I can stand at rehersal for five hours and be comfortable. The tone I get from this guitar is priceless. I got a very good deal on it from ZZSounds. I am very happy with the purchase!

                    "From a Jackson User"
            


                Sound:            

                The sound of this guitar is not as bright as I expected, but it did give very good and clear clean tones. The heavier riffs sound good to with the right volume and amp. Sustain was a little less than I expected, but a quick adjustment of the height of the pickups fixed that. The main problem is that once in tune, IT BUZZED. I had to make some adjustments but then it was fine. The pickups are definitely the most versatile I have heard to go through a variety of styles.            

                Feature:            

                Its pretty much what you would expect, it's a les paul so don't expect any bells and whistles. The volume and tone knobs are very responsive and just a little tweak makes a difference, although they go in reverse direction to what I'm used to for some reason. The main thing I want to say here is that the body is no where near as heavy as I expected. It is supposed to be weight relieved, not chambered, but it's not that much heavier to what I'm used to. If you are not used to a les paul neck, get ready to adjust. It's easier to me to chord, but much harder to solo.Again, I'm used to USA and japan Jacksons, so I knew this coming in. However, I definitely like the feel of the guitar's neck and the way it conforms to my hands. Just FYI, the binding is more of a cream than a white, and the case (made in Canada) is awesome.            

                Ease of Use:            

                Again, the neck and the upper fret access will be the biggest adjustment.            

                Quality:            

                First off, I'm a little biased because I don't mind paying a little more to keep American workers employed, but I did have one complaint on the construction. Everything is where it should be and the fretwork, tuners, finish, pickups, wood, and case were all fantastic, but there are 3 places where a razor blade cut into the binding on top and it is noticeable. This should not have been missed by any inspection checklist; it stands out. Everything else was top notch besides the strap buttons...way too small.            

                Value:            

                Even though I know I will get slammed, maybe cause I'm a ten year playing hobbyist and not a professional, I can't honestly say that there is a 1500 difference in this guitar and an Epi Custom I owned. A difference yes, but not that much of one other than the residual value. However, This is definitely a great buy over the Standard, .            

                Manufacturer Support:            

                Haven't dealt with them.            

                The Wow Factor:            

                The fact that you own something that will outlast you, and appreciate in value, is enough for me. Again, I was impressed with the versatility of the tones, the finish (ebony) and the tightness of the guitar. I was definitely wowed that it wasn't as heavy as what I expected, and I was wowed in a bad way on the cuts on the binding. The other appealing thing about this guitar is the price point is perfect, as standards are too expensive, fenders are a different breed, and USA Jackson's are nuts with their price increases.            

                Overall:            

                Just received my Left handed Les Paul Traditional. This is an early review because I want to offer people a perspective that are used to fast necks and comparing what you see in pictures to what you actually get

1. zZounds offers the industry‘s most musician-friendly payment plans

            zZounds offers a variety of Play as You Pay installment plans that allow you to get the gear you want today. While our competitors might offer house credit cards that require you to fill out an application and pass a credit check, our payment plans are easy to get, simple to use, and, best of all, accrue zero interest. Unlike those house credit cards that can leave you vulnerable to exorbitant interest charges once the promotional period ends, we never have and never will charge interest when you take advantage of one of the zZounds Play as You Pay plans.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
