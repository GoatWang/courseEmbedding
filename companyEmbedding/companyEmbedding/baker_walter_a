The Majesty of God in the Old Testament: A Guide for Preaching and Teaching

Author: Walter C. Kaiser
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2007
Pages: 176

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In The Majesty of God in the Old Testament, Walter Kaiser demonstrates how God’s unsurpassed majesty and greatness can be captured in contemporary teaching and preaching. Kaiser accomplishes this goal by walking through an exposition of 10 great Old Testament passages that are rife with evidence of God’s majesty. He also demonstrates how various types of preparatory studies—word, historical/archaeological, thematic, Bible background, and theological—can be used to help pastors make the Old Testament more relevant to their congregations. In addition, he addresses potential problems peculiar to the preaching of the Old Testament.


Those who preach about the greatness of God do business in deep waters. This book will help all of us who read, teach, or preach to navigate those waters.
—Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
Hats off to Walt Kaiser for demonstrating again that, in the end, the Scriptures are about the greatness of God. Using passage after passage of the Old Testament, Kaiser reminds us that the real subject of the Bible is God himself: his marvelous person, his wisdom-filled ways, his loving will. This book will serve as a bracing theocentric tonic for all who are determined to avoid those anthropocentric treatments of Scripture that seem so prevalent today.
—Duane Litfin, president, Wheaton College







Mission in the Old Testament: Israel as a Light to the Nations

Author: Walter C. Kaiser
Edition: 2nd
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 128

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Walter Kaiser questions the notion that the New Testament represents a deviation from God’s supposed intention to save only the Israelites. He argues that—contrary to popular opinion—the older testament does not reinforce an exclusive redemptive plan. Instead, it emphasizes a common human condition and God’s original and continuing concern for all humanity. Kaiser shows that the Israelites’ mission was always to actively spread the Good News of the promised Messiah to gentiles. This new edition adds two new chapters, freshens material throughout, expands the bibliography, and includes study questions.


Mission in the Old Testament challenges the axiom that the Gospel mandate begins with the New Testament. Dr. Kaiser rightly begins with Genesis 1–11 as the opening drama of redemptive history that explains the subsequent developments in the story of salvation. The connecting point between the Testaments is God’s promise to Abraham to include all the clans of the earth in his blessing. The book offers great insights for all concerned with the direction of the church.
—Willem A. VanGemeren, professor of Old Testament and Semitic languages, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School
In the best tradition of Richard De Ridder, John Stott, Arthur Glasser, John Piper, and Roger Greenway, this book is a much-needed resource for all . . . who want to understand God’s missionary purpose for the church as found in the Old Testament. . . . Clearly, concisely, and captivatingly written, [it] will make a wonderful resource for Bible study groups. It is a must-read for members of congregational outreach, evangelism, and mission committees, and is an outstanding resource for pastors to preach and teach on mission in the Old Testament. . . . The reader will [also] find excellent sources for further study in the footnotes and bibliography. . . . When members of our churches in North America read this book, they will be moved to recommit themselves to God’s mission of world evangelization.
—Charles Van Engen, Arthur F. Glasser Professor of Biblical Theology of Mission, Fuller Theological Seminary
Kaiser’s work is a welcome contribution to the literature that hopefully will correct popular evangelicalism’s sole reliance upon the New Testament for its mission theology.
—Missiology
Kaiser paints with broad strokes and at the same time provides finer details. His book needs to be read carefully with an open Bible to absorb the rich panorama of God’s mission heart. Christians who study this book will more fully understand the wonder of God’s grace and gain a fuller appreciation of the continuance of God’s mission of love from Old Testament times into our contemporary era.
—Evangelical Missions Quarterly
The book reflects the fact that it is written by a seasoned Old Testament professor and writer. He knows how to make his case so that students and churchmen will appreciate it. . . . The book is a helpful introduction to missionary themes in the Old Testament. Its brevity, its price, and its language should make it attractive to prospective readers.
—Ashland Theological Journal




 

Preaching and Teaching from the Old Testament: A Guide for the Church

Author: Walter C. Kaiser
Publisher: Baker Academic
Publication Date: 2003
Pages: 222

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Developed out of tried and tested teaching material, Kaiser exhibits a straightforward and accessible writing style. The opening chapters deal with the value, problem, and task of preaching from the Old Testament. Kaiser then provides a practical focus by examining preaching and teaching from the texts of various genres (proverbs, prophecy, Torah, etc.). A final chapter examines the relevance of the Old Testament in speaking to a contemporary audience. Pedagogical features include a glossary, a suggested outline/worksheet for expository preaching, and three indices.


Walter Kaiser gives a solid defense for preaching from the Old Testament and provides helpful insights on Old Testament backgrounds and interpretation. His hints for preaching the genres of the Old Testament will be of value to any preacher.
—Scott M. Gibson, Haddon W. Robinson Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
I always listen when Walter Kaiser, learned Old Testament scholar and preacher par excellence, speaks! Here is the very best advice-from the very best-as to how to preach the whole counsel of God. Every preacher should own this book.
—R. Kent Hughes, pastor, College Church, Wheaton, Ill.
The Bible of the early church was the Old Testament. It might be an interesting experiment for a pastor to preach from the Old Testament for a year to a twenty-first-century church. Preaching and Teaching from the Old Testament would be a reliable and practical guide to help pastors through that great expanse of God’s eternal truth.
—Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
Sensitive to the various literary forms found in the Bible, [Kaiser] provides guidelines for preaching and teaching from Old Testament narratives, wisdom material, prophetic texts, laments, laws, hymns of praise, and apocalyptic forms. He concludes his treatment of each form with an illustration of preaching a representative text. This is a fine guide for effective preaching and teaching.
—Dianne Bergant, Bible Today
Walter C. Kaiser Jr. . . . has long been recognized for his theological conservatism and insightful scholarship, and the more than thirty books he has authored have consistently demonstrated that these two virtues need not be incompatible with each other. Preaching and Teaching from the Old Testament is no exception. . . . Kaiser’s ‘statements,’ his theses, are valid and beneficial. They are biblical, sound, orthodox, and scholarly. The book is a methodological delight. Kaiser’s descriptions of various Old Testament genres and his demonstrations of how to preach these genres are priceless. The book is worth your money and time.
—Francis C. Rossow, Concordia Journal







Preaching and Teaching the Last Things: Old Testament Eschatology for the Life of the Church

Author: Walter C. Kaiser
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 208

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Distinguished Old Testament scholar Walter Kaiser believes that the Old Testament is sorely neglected today in teaching and preaching—and that it is even more neglected when it comes to setting forth the hope that Christians have for the future. Firmly believing that the Old Testament offers important insights into biblical eschatology and the Christian life, he provides guidance for preachers, teachers, and Bible students on expositing 15 key Old Testament eschatological passages. Each chapter focuses on a single biblical text. Kaiser introduces the topic, examines the issues, notes who has contributed to some of the solutions, and shows how this sets up the text to be exegeted and prepared for exposition.


What can we know about eschatology from Scripture, especially the Old Testament? Walter Kaiser’s Preaching and Teaching the Last Things shows us that we can know quite a lot. This is a helpful work for those who wonder how to preach or teach about the end with balance and clarity.
—Darrell L. Bock, senior research professor of New Testament studies, Dallas Theological Seminary
Walt Kaiser has offered a powerful and practical model for preaching and teaching the prophetic plan of God. His straightforward interpretation of the future provides strong support for a future, literal, earthly reign of the Messiah over the world from Jerusalem. Through the exposition of key prophetic texts, Kaiser shows the premillennial position to be both an Old and New Testament expectation.
—Mark L. Bailey, president and professor of Bible exposition, Dallas Theological Seminary
The book could easily be used as a supplement to a seminary preaching class. . . . Along with sermon helps and a teaching outline, each of the 15 or so passages chosen by Kaiser come with a brief six or seven page commentary. I found these comments interesting [and] extremely helpful. Bits of scholarly information pop up every now and then. . . . The time-strapped pastor or interested layman will find informed excursions such as these an added bonus.
—Journal of the Grace Evangelical Society




 

Toward an Exegetical Theology: Biblical Exegesis for Preaching and Teaching

Author: Walter C. Kaiser
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 1998
Pages: 272

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




According to Walter Kaiser, a gap exists in the academic preparation of ministers. It is the gap between the study of the biblical text (most frequently in the original languages) and the actual delivery of messages to God’s people. Very few centers of biblical and homiletical training have ever taken the time or effort to show the student how one moves from analyzing the text to constructing a sermon that reflects and is dependent on that analysis. The author intends to bridge this gap with Toward an Exegetical Theology. He proposes a syntactical-theological method of exegesis consisting of the following steps: (1) contextual analysis, (2) syntactical analysis, (3) verbal analysis, (4) theological analysis, and (5) homiletical analysis.
Kaiser finds no fault with the time honored grammatical-historical method except that it failed to go far enough in describing the main job of exegesis. In the syntactical-theological method the accent falls on syntactical analysis of the text and on biblical theology. Syntactical analysis systematically operates from three basic building blocks: (1) the concept, (2) the proposition, and (3) the paragraph. It is the precise way in which these three units are organized and arranged that provides the exegete all the data necessary to begin the journey of moving from the text to the destination of using that text in a teaching and preaching situation.







What Does the Lord Require?: A Guide for Preaching and Teaching Biblical Ethics

Author: Walter C. Kaiser
Publisher: Baker Academic
Publication Date: 2009
Pages: 256

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Situational ethics, made popular in the 1960s, teaches that “all we need is love.” Loving is how we should be, but it does not tell us what to do. A biblical ethic, which can provide real guidance, begins with the light of Scripture. But how applicable is the Bible’s moral standard to the complex issues we face today, such as stem cell research, euthanasia, racism, gambling, and environmental care? And how does a person use Scripture in making or evaluating ethical decisions?
Trusted Bible scholar and teacher Walter Kaiser answers these questions by connecting 18 tough ethical issues with 18 key teaching Scriptures—including, for example, poverty with Isaiah 58, genetic engineering with Genesis 1:26–30 and 2:15–25, substance abuse with Proverbs 23:29–35, cohabitation with 1 Thessalonians 4:1–8, and war with Deuteronomy 20:1–20 and Romans 13:1–7. Through authoritative teaching from Scripture, suggested expositional outlines, and insights from years of teaching this material at Gordon-Conwell and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Kaiser demonstrates how to connect Scripture to ethical issues and train congregations to think biblically about ethics. The result is a vital text for teaching pastors, a stimulating resource and guide for preaching, and a foundation for developing Bible studies.


This series of studies will prove an invaluable tool to any Christian leader and will leave every thinking believer, even if not in agreement with all Dr. Kaiser’s conclusions on every issue, sharing the Jubilee Centre’s desire to explore further the continued relevance of biblical principles to the social, economic, and political questions facing modern society.
—John Hayward, executive director, Jubilee Centre, Cambridge, England
In today’s churches, many ethical pronouncements are made without firm biblical grounding, and many biblical sermons are preached without concrete application to the issues of the day. This book will help preachers and teachers speak to the ethical challenges facing the church from an informed perspective rooted in sound biblical theology and solid scholarship. I heartily recommend it.
—John Jefferson Davis, professor of systematic theology and Christian ethics, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
Walt Kaiser is the right person to write this book. The work reveals a lifetime of experience in the Scriptures, in the classroom, and in churches. Kaiser’s strategy of working primarily with one or two focal texts in relation to each ethical issue addressed is a unique and valuable aspect of the book. His close adherence to the biblical text offers a fine model for expository preaching and teaching. This work will serve well as a textbook for college and seminary level ethics courses, as a trustworthy guide for pastors, lay leaders, and all ministry professionals who desire to apply faithfully the texts of Scripture to many of today’s crucial ethical issues. I highly recommend this superb volume and expect it will have a long and useful life.
—Robert V. Rakestraw, emeritus professor of theology, Bethel Seminary
Many people feel overwhelmed by the number and complexity of the moral questions we face. And with people knowing less of God’s Word, the need for accurate biblical guidance for navigating today’s ethical dilemmas has never been greater. Thankfully, Walter Kaiser fills the void by clearly pointing us back to our biblical roots for moral guidance and by unpacking the meaning and implications of central teaching passages from the Bible. Kaiser has done it again!
—David K. Clark, executive vice president and provost, Bethel Seminary
Too many Christian preachers think that Christian preaching can only be done from the gospel reading or the writings of St. Paul. Kaiser demonstrates how genuine Christian preaching can be inspired by Old Testament passages as well. Here he focuses his attention more specifically on passages that deal with ethical matters. . . . His critical approach to the biblical material and his method of recontextualization will enlighten even those who might not agree with his theological stand.
—The Bible Today
Walter Kaiser’s latest contribution to biblical studies is a refreshingly new approach to Christian ethics—preached and taught. . . . The range is considerably wider than many evangelical books on ethics. . . . This is a helpful book, not least in the assistance it offers in preaching from the ethical material in Scripture.
—Reformed Theological Journal

Pedagogical features include a glossary, a suggested outline/worksheet for expository preaching, and three indices.


Walter Kaiser gives a solid defense for preaching from the Old Testament and provides helpful insights on Old Testament backgrounds and interpretation. His hints for preaching the genres of the Old Testament will be of value to any preacher.
—Scott M. Gibson, Haddon W. Robinson Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
I always listen when Walter Kaiser, learned Old Testament scholar and preacher par excellence, speaks! Here is the very best advice-from the very best-as to how to preach the whole counsel of God. Every preacher should own this book.
—R. Kent Hughes, pastor, College Church, Wheaton, Ill.
The Bible of the early church was the Old Testament. It might be an interesting experiment for a pastor to preach from the Old Testament for a year to a twenty-first-century church. Preaching and Teaching from the Old Testament would be a reliable and practical guide to help pastors through that great expanse of God’s eternal truth.
—Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
Sensitive to the various literary forms found in the Bible, [Kaiser] provides guidelines for preaching and teaching from Old Testament narratives, wisdom material, prophetic texts, laments, laws, hymns of praise, and apocalyptic forms. He concludes his treatment of each form with an illustration of preaching a representative text. This is a fine guide for effective preaching and teaching.
—Dianne Bergant, Bible Today
Walter C. Kaiser Jr. . . . has long been recognized for his theological conservatism and insightful scholarship, and the more than thirty books he has authored have consistently demonstrated that these two virtues need not be incompatible with each other. Preaching and Teaching from the Old Testament is no exception. . . . Kaiser’s ‘statements,’ his theses, are valid and beneficial. They are biblical, sound, orthodox, and scholarly. The book is a methodological delight. Kaiser’s descriptions of various Old Testament genres and his demonstrations of how to preach these genres are priceless. The book is worth your money and time.

Preaching and Teaching the Last Things: Old Testament Eschatology for the Life of the Church

Author: Walter C. Kaiser
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 208

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Distinguished Old Testament scholar Walter Kaiser believes that the Old Testament is sorely neglected today in teaching and preaching—and that it is even more neglected when it comes to setting forth the hope that Christians have for the future. Firmly believing that the Old Testament offers important insights into biblical eschatology and the Christian life, he provides guidance for preachers, teachers, and Bible students on expositing 15 key Old Testament eschatological passages. Each chapter focuses on a single biblical text. Kaiser introduces the topic, examines the issues, notes who has contributed to some of the solutions, and shows how this sets up the text to be exegeted and prepared for exposition.


What can we know about eschatology from Scripture, especially the Old Testament? Walter Kaiser’s Preaching and Teaching the Last Things shows us that we can know quite a lot. This is a helpful work for those who wonder how to preach or teach about the end with balance and clarity.
—Darrell L. Bock, senior research professor of New Testament studies, Dallas Theological Seminary
Walt Kaiser has offered a powerful and practical model for preaching and teaching the prophetic plan of God. His straightforward interpretation of the future provides strong support for a future, literal, earthly reign of the Messiah over the world from Jerusalem. Through the exposition of key prophetic texts, Kaiser shows the premillennial position to be both an Old and New Testament expectation.
—Mark L. Bailey, president and professor of Bible exposition, Dallas Theological Seminary
The book could easily be used as a supplement to a seminary preaching class. . . . Along with sermon helps and a teaching outline, each of the 15 or so passages chosen by Kaiser come with a brief six or seven page commentary. I found these comments interesting [and] extremely helpful. Bits of scholarly information pop up every now and then. . . . The time-strapped pastor or interested layman will find informed excursions such as these an added bonus.
—Journal of the Grace Evangelical Society




 

Toward an Exegetical Theology: Biblical Exegesis for Preaching and Teaching

Author: Walter C. Kaiser
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 1998
Pages: 272

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




According to Walter Kaiser, a gap exists in the academic preparation of ministers. It is the gap between the study of the biblical text (most frequently in the original languages) and the actual delivery of messages to God’s people. Very few centers of biblical and homiletical training have ever taken the time or effort to show the student how one moves from analyzing the text to constructing a sermon that reflects and is dependent on that analysis. The author intends to bridge this gap with Toward an Exegetical Theology. He proposes a syntactical-theological method of exegesis consisting of the following steps: (1) contextual analysis, (2) syntactical analysis, (3) verbal analysis, (4) theological analysis, and (5) homiletical analysis.
Kaiser finds no fault with the time honored grammatical-historical method except that it failed to go far enough in describing the main job of exegesis. In the syntactical-theological method the accent falls on syntactical analysis of the text and on biblical theology. Syntactical analysis systematically operates from three basic building blocks: (1) the concept, (2) the proposition, and (3) the paragraph. It is the precise way in which these three units are organized and arranged that provides the exegete all the data necessary to begin the journey of moving from the text to the destination of using that text in a teaching and preaching situation.







What Does the Lord Require?: A Guide for Preaching and Teaching Biblical Ethics

Author: Walter C. Kaiser
Publisher: Baker Academic
Publication Date: 2009
Pages: 256

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Situational ethics, made popular in the 1960s, teaches that “all we need is love.” Loving is how we should be, but it does not tell us what to do. A biblical ethic, which can provide real guidance, begins with the light of Scripture. But how applicable is the Bible’s moral standard to the complex issues we face today, such as stem cell research, euthanasia, racism, gambling, and environmental care? And how does a person use Scripture in making or evaluating ethical decisions?
Trusted Bible scholar and teacher Walter Kaiser answers these questions by connecting 18 tough ethical issues with 18 key teaching Scriptures—including, for example, poverty with Isaiah 58, genetic engineering with Genesis 1:26–30 and 2:15–25, substance abuse with Proverbs 23:29–35, cohabitation with 1 Thessalonians 4:1–8, and war with Deuteronomy 20:1–20 and Romans 13:1–7. Through authoritative teaching from Scripture, suggested expositional outlines, and insights from years of teaching this material at Gordon-Conwell and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Kaiser demonstrates how to connect Scripture to ethical issues and train congregations to think biblically about ethics. The result is a vital text for teaching pastors, a stimulating resource and guide for preaching, and a foundation for developing Bible studies.


This series of studies will prove an invaluable tool to any Christian leader and will leave every thinking believer, even if not in agreement with all Dr. Kaiser’s conclusions on every issue, sharing the Jubilee Centre’s desire to explore further the continued relevance of biblical principles to the social, economic, and political questions facing modern society.
—John Hayward, executive director, Jubilee Centre, Cambridge, England
In today’s churches, many ethical pronouncements are made without firm biblical grounding, and many biblical sermons are preached without concrete application to the issues of the day. This book will help preachers and teachers speak to the ethical challenges facing the church from an informed perspective rooted in sound biblical theology and solid scholarship. I heartily recommend it.
—John Jefferson Davis, professor of systematic theology and Christian ethics, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
Walt Kaiser is the right person to write this book. The work reveals a lifetime of experience in the Scriptures, in the classroom, and in churches. Kaiser’s strategy of working primarily with one or two focal texts in relation to each ethical issue addressed is a unique and valuable aspect of the book. His close adherence to the biblical text offers a fine model for expository preaching and teaching. This work will serve well as a textbook for college and seminary level ethics courses, as a trustworthy guide for pastors, lay leaders, and all ministry professionals who desire to apply faithfully the texts of Scripture to many of today’s crucial ethical issues. I highly recommend this superb volume and expect it will have a long and useful life.
—Robert V. Rakestraw, emeritus professor of theology, Bethel Seminary
Many people feel overwhelmed by the number and complexity of the moral questions we face. And with people knowing less of God’s Word, the need for accurate biblical guidance for navigating today’s ethical dilemmas has never been greater. Thankfully, Walter Kaiser fills the void by clearly pointing us back to our biblical roots for moral guidance and by unpacking the meaning and implications of central teaching passages from the Bible. Kaiser has done it again!
—David K. Clark, executive vice president and provost, Bethel Seminary
Too many Christian preachers think that Christian preaching can only be done from the gospel reading or the writings of St. Paul. Kaiser demonstrates how genuine Christian preaching can be inspired by Old Testament passages as well. Here he focuses his attention more specifically on passages that deal with ethical matters. . . . His critical approach to the biblical material and his method of recontextualization will enlighten even those who might not agree with his theological stand.
—The Bible Today
Walter Kaiser’s latest contribution to biblical studies is a refreshingly new approach to Christian ethics—preached and taught. . . . The range is considerably wider than many evangelical books on ethics. . . . This is a helpful book, not least in the assistance it offers in preaching from the ethical material in Scripture.
—Reformed Theological Journal

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Baker's Cocoa Advertisement in Overland Monthly, January 1919


Baker's Chocolate is a brand name for the line of baking chocolates[1] owned by the Kraft Heinz Company (formerly Kraft Foods). Products include a variety of bulk chocolates, including white and unsweetened, and sweetened coconut flakes. It is one of the largest national brands of chocolate in the United States. The company was originally named Walter Baker & Company.

History[edit]
In 1764, John Hannon (or alternatively spelled "Hannan" in some sources) and the American physician Dr. James Baker started importing beans and producing chocolate in the Lower Mills section of Dorchester, Massachusetts.[2]
After Hannon never returned from a 1779 sailing trip to the West Indies to purchase cocoa beans, his wife sold the company to Dr. Baker in 1780, and the company was renamed to the Baker Chocolate Company.[3] His first product was a cake of chocolate for making a sweetened chocolate drink. Distribution was mainly in the Northeastern United States until 1804, when Dr. Baker's son, Edmund Baker, inherited the family business and increased production with a state-of-the-art mill.
The original brand name was "Hannon’s Best Chocolate," which was "manufactured for almost fifteen years" and was sold with a money-back guarantee if the consumer was unsatisfied with the product.[3] The name was changed in 1780 after Hannon's wife, Elizabeth Gore Hannon, sold the company to Baker in 1780, after Hannon never returned from a 1779 sailing trip to the West Indies to purchase cocoa beans.[3] At the time, it was rumored that Hannon intended to leave his wife, and thus deserted her.[3] Original versions of the brand were not prepared for baking, and before 1865, the company purveyed three grades of drinking chocolate, which were "Best Chocolate", "Common Chocolate" and "Inferior Chocolate".[1] The inferior grade was mostly sold to West Indian and American slaves.[1]
By 1849, under Walter Baker, the Baker's Chocolate brand had spread to California, during the Gold Rush era. Production was limited to one kind of chocolate until 1852, when employee Samuel German created "German's Sweet Chocolate" that had a higher sugar content than previous baking chocolates. In 1957 a Dallas, Texas newspaper printed a cake recipe for "German's Chocolate Cake" based on this chocolate, which was reprinted by the company's owner General Foods under the "German chocolate cake", becoming the accepted name.
Production steadily increased through the century. The trademark logo of La Belle Chocolatière was adopted in 1883 by the fourth-generation familial owner, Henry L. Pierce, step-nephew of Walter Baker. Pierce began advertising Baker's Chocolate heavily in newspapers to increase sales.[1] In 1896, Baker's Chocolate was advertising in around 8,000 newspapers in the United States.[1] The company also advertised using signage and cards in grocery stores, in novels, in street cars and using billboards.[1] Promotional offers of tableware and logo pins helped attract customers. Around the late 1800s, the company began promoting the notion of using chocolate as an ingredient in desserts and for baking.[1]
Following Pierce's death in 1896, the Forbes Syndicate bought the company, which they sold In 1927 to the Postum Cereal Company, later known as General Foods. In 1969 production moved from Dorchester, Massachusetts to Dover, Delaware. The company was passed onto Kraft Foods in 1989 when they acquired General Foods and finally forked out to Mondelez International in 2012.
Products[edit]
Baker's continues to expand its line of products, focusing on conveniences for the home baker. Some products, such as vanilla extract and cocoa powder, have been discontinued with company turnovers. Other products are available to food service professionals in bulk, considerably different kinds of coconut, cocoa drinks, and bulk chocolate.
Baker's most common products:

German's Sweet Chocolate 'Bar' (48% cacao)
Semi-sweet chocolate (56% cacao)
Bittersweet chocolate (66% cacao)
Unsweetened chocolate (100% cacao)
Premium white chocolate (0% cacao)
Dipping chocolate (milk or dark)
Sweetened Angel Flake coconut

The original brand name was "Hannon’s Best Chocolate," which was "manufactured for almost fifteen years" and was sold with a money-back guarantee if the consumer was unsatisfied with the product.[3] The name was changed in 1780 after Hannon's wife, Elizabeth Gore Hannon, sold the company to Baker in 1780, after Hannon never returned from a 1779 sailing trip to the West Indies to purchase cocoa beans.[3] At the time, it was rumored that Hannon intended to leave his wife, and thus deserted her.[3] Original versions of the brand were not prepared for baking, and before 1865, the company purveyed three grades of drinking chocolate, which were "Best Chocolate", "Common Chocolate" and "Inferior Chocolate".[1] The inferior grade was mostly sold to West Indian and American slaves.[1]
By 1849, under Walter Baker, the Baker's Chocolate brand had spread to California, during the Gold Rush era. Production was limited to one kind of chocolate until 1852, when employee Samuel German created "German's Sweet Chocolate" that had a higher sugar content than previous baking chocolates. In 1957 a Dallas, Texas newspaper printed a cake recipe for "German's Chocolate Cake" based on this chocolate, which was reprinted by the company's owner General Foods under the "German chocolate cake", becoming the accepted name.
Production steadily increased through the century. The trademark logo of La Belle Chocolatière was adopted in 1883 by the fourth-generation familial owner, Henry L. Pierce, step-nephew of Walter Baker. Pierce began advertising Baker's Chocolate heavily in newspapers to increase sales.[1] In 1896, Baker's Chocolate was advertising in around 8,000 newspapers in the United States.[1] The company also advertised using signage and cards in grocery stores, in novels, in street cars and using billboards.[1] Promotional offers of tableware and logo pins helped attract customers. Around the late 1800s, the company began promoting the notion of using chocolate as an ingredient in desserts and for baking.[1]
Following Pierce's death in 1896, the Forbes Syndicate bought the company, which they sold In 1927 to the Postum Cereal Company, later known as General Foods. In 1969 production moved from Dorchester, Massachusetts to Dover, Delaware. The company was passed onto Kraft Foods in 1989 when they acquired General Foods and finally forked out to Mondelez International in 2012.
Products[edit]
Baker's continues to expand its line of products, focusing on conveniences for the home baker. Some products, such as vanilla extract and cocoa powder, have been discontinued with company turnovers. Other products are available to food service professionals in bulk, considerably different kinds of coconut, cocoa drinks, and bulk chocolate.
Baker's most common products:

German's Sweet Chocolate 'Bar' (48% cacao)
Semi-sweet chocolate (56% cacao)
Bittersweet chocolate (66% cacao)
Unsweetened chocolate (100% cacao)
Premium white chocolate (0% cacao)

Walter Baker & Company - Wikipedia






















 






Walter Baker & Company

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Baker's Cocoa Advertisement in Overland Monthly, January 1919. The manufacture of chocolate had been introduced in the United States in 1765 by John Hannon and Dr. James Baker in Dorchester. Walter Baker & Company was located in Dorchester, Massachusetts.






Former chocolate factory buildings in Lower Mills Village on the Neponset River between Dorchester, Massachusetts and Milton, Massachusetts.


The Baker Chocolate Company is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. The company was established when a physician named Dr. James Baker met John Hannon on the banks of the Neponset River. Irishman John Hannon was penniless but was a skilled chocolatier, a craft which he had learned in England[1] and which was, until now, exclusive to Europe. With the help of Baker, Hannon was able to set up a business where he produced “Hannon’s Best Chocolate” for 15 years. In 1779, Hannon went on a trip to the West Indies and never returned. His wife sold the company in 1780 to Dr. Baker who changed the name to Baker Chocolate Company.[2] The Baker's Chocolate brand now belongs to Mondelez International.

Edmund and Walter Baker[edit]
Dr. James Baker’s son, Edmund (1770–1846), and his son, Colonel Walter (1792–1852), successfully carried on the business. The chocolate was marketed with a guaranteed money-back policy if the customers were not one hundred percent satisfied with their purchase. Colonel Walter Baker had studied law at Harvard College and thus had the name “Baker’s” legally protected for future generations of this family business.[2]
Henry Lillie Pierce[edit]
After Colonel Walter Baker died, his brother-in-law Sidney Williams took over, but died two years later. Henry Lillie Pierce, a stepnephew of Walter Baker, leased the business for the next thirty years. Henry Lillie Pierce expanded the business substantially. He added more buildings for the production and found new market places for the chocolate products. He exhibited his products at Exhibitions in both the old and new worlds, and won an award at the Vienna Exhibition in 1873. Pierce was an influential citizen of Dorchester and politically very active: he was elected mayor of the city of Boston twice, served as US congressman and in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.[2][3]
La Belle Chocolatière[edit]
The logo of the chocolate server, called La Belle Chocolatière, was adopted in 1883 after a painting by the Swiss artist Jean-Étienne Liotard called Das Schokoladenmädchen which can be found at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (art gallery) in Dresden, Germany. The story of the Schokoladenmädchen not as clear cut as published in the Choice Recipes from 1913. The painting was done in the 1740s at the Vienna court of the Austrian Kaiserin Maria Theresia at a time when Jean-Etienne Liotard had been commissioned to paint both the Kaiser and Kaiserin (empress and emperor). It is said that the model of the Schokoladenmädchen was one of the young ladies at court whose beauty led Liotard to put it on a canvas.[4]
Walter Baker & Company published the story in Choice Recipes, 1913, as follows:




Das Schokoladenmädchen by Jean-Étienne Liotard, 1743-45


"...There is a romance connected with the charming Viennese girl who served as the model, which is well worth telling. One of the leading journals of Vienna has thrown some light an the Baltauf, or Baldauf, family to which the subject of Liotard's painting belonged. Anna, or Annerl, as she was called by friends and relatives, was the daughter of Melchior Baltauf, a knight, who was living in Vienna in 1760, when Liotard was in that city making portraits of some members of the Austrian Court. It is not clear whether Anna was earning her living as a chocolate bearer at that time or whether she posed as a society belle in that becoming costume; but, be that as it may, her beauty won the love of a prince of the Empire, whose name, Dietrichstein, is known now only because he married the charming girl who was immortalized by a great artist. The marriage caused a great deal of talk in Austrian society at the time, and many different stories have been told about it. The prejudices of caste have always been very strong in Vienna, and a daughter of a knight, even if well-to-do, was not considered a suitable match for a member of the court. It is said that an the wedding day Anna invited the chocolate bearers with whom she had worked or played, and in "sportive joy at her own elevation" offered her hand to them saying, " Behold! now that I am a princess you may kiss my hand." She was probably about twenty years of age when the portrait was painted in 1760, and she lived until 1825..."[5]
Forbes Syndicate[edit]
The company was sold in 1896, following the death of Pierce, to the Forbes Syndicate. They greatly expanded the factory, adding the Powder House, the Ware Mill, the Preston Mill, the Forbes Mill, and the Baker Administrative Building over the next thirty years. The Forbes Syndicate advertised Baker’s chocolate in magazines such as the Youth Companion, Booklovers’ Magazine, Red Book Magazine, and Liberty.
The Forbes Syndicate had the idea to reinforce loyalty to the brand by giving out coupons that could be redeemed for bone china services, bookends, spoons and serving trays as well as the very popular cookbook, which was published every year.
Postum Cereal Company, which later changed its name to General Foods, bought Walter Baker & Company in 1927 and moved the production to Delaware in 1965. By 1995, the Walter Baker & Company was incorporated into Kraft Foods.

Walter Baker & Company - Wikipedia






















 






Walter Baker & Company

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Baker's Cocoa Advertisement in Overland Monthly, January 1919. The manufacture of chocolate had been introduced in the United States in 1765 by John Hannon and Dr. James Baker in Dorchester. Walter Baker & Company was located in Dorchester, Massachusetts.






Former chocolate factory buildings in Lower Mills Village on the Neponset River between Dorchester, Massachusetts and Milton, Massachusetts.


The Baker Chocolate Company is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. The company was established when a physician named Dr. James Baker met John Hannon on the banks of the Neponset River. Irishman John Hannon was penniless but was a skilled chocolatier, a craft which he had learned in England[1] and which was, until now, exclusive to Europe. With the help of Baker, Hannon was able to set up a business where he produced “Hannon’s Best Chocolate” for 15 years. In 1779, Hannon went on a trip to the West Indies and never returned. His wife sold the company in 1780 to Dr. Baker who changed the name to Baker Chocolate Company.[2] The Baker's Chocolate brand now belongs to Mondelez International.

Edmund and Walter Baker[edit]
Dr. James Baker’s son, Edmund (1770–1846), and his son, Colonel Walter (1792–1852), successfully carried on the business. The chocolate was marketed with a guaranteed money-back policy if the customers were not one hundred percent satisfied with their purchase. Colonel Walter Baker had studied law at Harvard College and thus had the name “Baker’s” legally protected for future generations of this family business.[2]
Henry Lillie Pierce[edit]
After Colonel Walter Baker died, his brother-in-law Sidney Williams took over, but died two years later. Henry Lillie Pierce, a stepnephew of Walter Baker, leased the business for the next thirty years. Henry Lillie Pierce expanded the business substantially. He added more buildings for the production and found new market places for the chocolate products. He exhibited his products at Exhibitions in both the old and new worlds, and won an award at the Vienna Exhibition in 1873. Pierce was an influential citizen of Dorchester and politically very active: he was elected mayor of the city of Boston twice, served as US congressman and in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.[2][3]
La Belle Chocolatière[edit]
The logo of the chocolate server, called La Belle Chocolatière, was adopted in 1883 after a painting by the Swiss artist Jean-Étienne Liotard called Das Schokoladenmädchen which can be found at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (art gallery) in Dresden, Germany. The story of the Schokoladenmädchen not as clear cut as published in the Choice Recipes from 1913. The painting was done in the 1740s at the Vienna court of the Austrian Kaiserin Maria Theresia at a time when Jean-Etienne Liotard had been commissioned to paint both the Kaiser and Kaiserin (empress and emperor). It is said that the model of the Schokoladenmädchen was one of the young ladies at court whose beauty led Liotard to put it on a canvas.[4]
Walter Baker & Company published the story in Choice Recipes, 1913, as follows:




Das Schokoladenmädchen by Jean-Étienne Liotard, 1743-45


"...There is a romance connected with the charming Viennese girl who served as the model, which is well worth telling. One of the leading journals of Vienna has thrown some light an the Baltauf, or Baldauf, family to which the subject of Liotard's painting belonged. Anna, or Annerl, as she was called by friends and relatives, was the daughter of Melchior Baltauf, a knight, who was living in Vienna in 1760, when Liotard was in that city making portraits of some members of the Austrian Court. It is not clear whether Anna was earning her living as a chocolate bearer at that time or whether she posed as a society belle in that becoming costume; but, be that as it may, her beauty won the love of a prince of the Empire, whose name, Dietrichstein, is known now only because he married the charming girl who was immortalized by a great artist. The marriage caused a great deal of talk in Austrian society at the time, and many different stories have been told about it. The prejudices of caste have always been very strong in Vienna, and a daughter of a knight, even if well-to-do, was not considered a suitable match for a member of the court. It is said that an the wedding day Anna invited the chocolate bearers with whom she had worked or played, and in "sportive joy at her own elevation" offered her hand to them saying, " Behold! now that I am a princess you may kiss my hand." She was probably about twenty years of age when the portrait was painted in 1760, and she lived until 1825..."[5]
Forbes Syndicate[edit]
The company was sold in 1896, following the death of Pierce, to the Forbes Syndicate. They greatly expanded the factory, adding the Powder House, the Ware Mill, the Preston Mill, the Forbes Mill, and the Baker Administrative Building over the next thirty years. The Forbes Syndicate advertised Baker’s chocolate in magazines such as the Youth Companion, Booklovers’ Magazine, Red Book Magazine, and Liberty.
The Forbes Syndicate had the idea to reinforce loyalty to the brand by giving out coupons that could be redeemed for bone china services, bookends, spoons and serving trays as well as the very popular cookbook, which was published every year.
Postum Cereal Company, which later changed its name to General Foods, bought Walter Baker & Company in 1927 and moved the production to Delaware in 1965. By 1995, the Walter Baker & Company was incorporated into Kraft Foods.

Rated 2 out of 5 by Lovecats Ugly Sweater
 This is a first after many, many years. I don't get the good reviews!
There are no one or two star reviews!. This sweater is really odd. The lace down the sleeves
is so rough and raggedy. It is all raveling. That is supposed to be the look, however. It is really, ugly.
This is a NO for me. Maybe not for women over 60 with more traditional taste?
Do not just go by all the good reviews.

Rated 5 out of 5 by laurievei nice tunic length
 Just received this today. I got the black and grey and it will look adorable with either black or grey leggings. I don't agree that it runs a little big. I ordered an XS and it fits, but I could have gotten the S. I'm 5'5" and 127 lbs. Tunic length is great though. Long enough, but not too long.

Rated 4 out of 5 by gmarose lovely to look at
 The sweater is lovely and I feel good wearing it. It is soft and comfortable. The only problem is the arm ribbing. It is a bit loose, but other than that I can't complain.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Moonshadow Great Designer
 Love this sweater. My only complaint would be to please remember the petite. Nevertheless, love the material, design and fit. No need to order up or down; order regular size. Would love to see more by Water!

Rated 5 out of 5 by DelaneyFinn Pretty details
 When I ordered this sweater, I thought from the description, that the sleeves were lace. I was a skeptic that my arms may not look good in this tunic. BUT, when I received this sweater the lace is put on the sleeve, not making the sleeve see thru, what luck! The sweater looks great on......do not hesitate to buy! I bought the gray!

Rated 5 out of 5 by Ladyzep Wonderfully Comfortable!
 I love this top! It's warm and cozy and long enough to cover my hips and wear over yoga pants on casual Friday to work. I'm 59 years old, 5'8" and 175 lbs. and yes, I am hippy! I ordered a Large in this top and it's roomy but not baggy. Any top that covers these hips gets 5 stars from me!

Rated 5 out of 5 by JBecca LOVE This Sweater!
 I'd buy this in 10 colors if he made them! LOVE the look of this with black leggings/skinny pants and tall boots. So cute, comfortable, not too thick and not too thin material definitely a long tunic-type length. Absolutely recommend!

Rated 5 out of 5 by rebeck Perfect Sweater!
 I love it. I bought the large. (I am between a medium and a large) I don't like anything clingy. It's a great fit. Going to get the blue one too!

Rated 4 out of 5 by Angel67 Surprised!
 I thought this was a cute top that I could maybe dress up a little or wear with a casual jean but was afraid being a plus size that it would not fit or work well for curves. Surprising, it is great! I read other reviews about the fabric being more like a sweatshirt. I don't think of it that way at all. I wouldn't wear it for something formal or black tie event , but it is great and comfy to wear with black dress pants to church or with a casual black pair of pants to teach in all day. I find the gray/black combo very flattering and washes well. I wear it with a little bit of a lighter gray pant and it looks great! I did line dry as I usually do all of my nice clothing.

Rated 3 out of 5 by WildCat Just ok
 I almost kept this one in the cobalt because I wanted something in that color. Generous cut, cozy long sleeves. But something about how the knit clung accentuated my bad points. I ordered the gray too, but it was just way too dark, so am returning both. I'm not so keen on lace, but some peopled may like that. It was well-attached.

Rated 5 out of 5 by MaggieMack Love Walter Baker!
 I purchased several items by Walter Baker before he showed up on the Q. His designs are always a step up and cutting edge. I got this top in the sapphire and wore it today with similarly colored leggings, so adorable. Put a scarf with it, too. Several compliments came my way. This tunic is long, but fitted, not oversized. I meant to order an XS but ordered an XXS by mistake and it wound up being the perfect fit for my body, 5'7" 120#. I love the fabric and the lace on the arms. Great job, Mr. Baker!

Rated 4 out of 5 by MMH0805 Nice sweater
 The sweater is very nice and I have gotten compliments on it. It is not as dressy as I would have hoped it to be. It is also long so will be wearing with leggings. I did notice one of the hosts wearing it on a show and she put on a black scarf with it which made it look nicer. Will be keeping it, just worred that the lace on the arms may come off.

Our women’s clothing selection houses both classic and on-trend options so you can find exactly what you want–favorite denim, women’s dresses, office-ready looks, everyday tees, swimwear, and other wardrobe essentials. Check out our selection of women’s shoes for styles that complement the latest women’s clothing, or to find must-haves like running shoes, rain boots, and outdoor shoes.
