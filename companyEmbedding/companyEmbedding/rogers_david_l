David is smart - he assimilates information quickly and registers high on the creativity scale.  He is adept strategically and can also execute well.  If you want someone to think of the next thing and then drive it to market, David is your guy.See moreSee lessI’m pretty sure that David was born with veins filled with pure marketing blood.  I’ve watched him work, and had the pleasure of working closely with him, for more than 20 years, with only a few breaks during that time.  My advertising agency, SicolaMartin (now Y&R Austin) worked with David when he was with Motorola, Intel and CoreLogic. Here’s what I learned about David.

He’s smart.  Not an “I’m smarter than you” irritating smart, but a “this is what my experience tells me, but let’s make certain this is the best path” smart.

He’s creative.  He’s fearless when it comes to thinking outside the box and seeking innovative solutions.  He always pushed our agency for leading-edge work that got results.  And even though he would always say, “you guys are the creative ones”, he often played a major role in the shaping of both the programs required and the creative executions. 

He’s experienced.  He’s worked the full gamut in the marketing world.  He’s succeeded in a variety of different businesses, cultures, roles, teams and markets.  He’s worn many hats and he can make even the newest ones look like old, well-worn favorites in short order.

He’s genuine.  With David, what you see is what you get.  There is no posturing, no time wasted on political maneuvering, and no “it’s all about me”.  He’s focused on aiming for success and being a supportive team player.

He’s dedicated.  He works extremely hard at everything he does and he’s (as his resume will reveal) loyal to the companies and the teams he serves.  He’s the opposite of a job hopper.  He’s the kind of professional that every company wants to attract and keep.

He’s a leader.  In fact, he’s the kind of leader that CEOs love, team members admire and trust, and advertising agencies rarely find from the “client” side.  Of all the clients I‘ve worked with in my 30 years of having had an agency, David is among those favorites that I can count on one hand.  He knows how to make you feel sincerely appreciated and it always brings out the best in everyone…including the agency.

He’s fun.  Let me repeat that.  He’s fun.  And truly nice.  That may not mean much to you, but when I’m working a 12-hour day with someone, fun is a quality that’s worth its weight in gold.  Life is too short to work with mean people, which is why I consider myself lucky to have worked with David for so many great, fun years.

If you want to learn even more about David, feel free to contact me and I just might share some of the unpublished stories that could fill a whole volume of legendary, marketing lore.

Publisher's Description▼▲
What is expository preaching?” In this brilliant new book, Dr. Stephen Olford and Dr. David Olford, both widely respected preachers in their own right define expository preaching” (exposing Scripture instead of imposing upon it”), teach its technique, and express its significance (all true preaching is expository”).This book equips and encourages preachers of all kinds to respect their calling and minister God’s inerrant Word by the Olford’s marvelous methods.


Author Bio▼▲
 David Olford is chairman of the board and president of Olford Ministries International and holds the Stephen Olford Chair of Preaching, named in his late father's honor, at Union University in Memphis, Tennessee. His books include The Secret of Soul Winning and Find Us Faithful: Leadership that Leaves a Legacy. He and his wife have two children.
 Stephen Olford (1918 - 2004) was an internationally known minister, born in Zambia and serving churches in England and the United States. Often called the preacher's preacher, he influenced countless lives and pioneered the Encounter radio program and Olford Ministries International, both of which continue today.

            Stephen F. Olford and his son, David L. Olford, did a very good job creating this book that I would call more of an encyclopedia of helps for anyone that feels called to preach the Word of God.  This book is broken out into three parts that cover the preacher and his walk, then his efforts as they related to the sermon, followed by the actual delivery of the sermon.   If that wasn't enough, there are 4 appendices that cover the preacher and worship, music, evangelism and the book of Romans.  I really appreciated the 2nd part of this book, as the author nicely covered the Inductive Bible Study approach as it closely reflects many of the steps that we did in the Inductive Bible Study Classes we did at our church.  This book is full of such valuable guidance, wisdom and practical advice, I would highly recommend this book to anyone that feels a calling to preach.  This for sure is a book that I will be referencing quite often over the years.


I received a copy of this book from B&H Academic in exchange for my honest review.

            So far, it is exactly the input I needed to help cross the T's and dot the i's in sermon prep. I would recommend it to anyone who may not be able to attend seminary but are in a position to share God's Word with God's people.

Rogers argues that digital transformation is not about updating your technology but about upgrading your strategic thinking. Based on Rogers's decade of research and teaching at Columbia Business School, and his consulting for businesses around the world, The Digital Transformation Playbook shows how pre-digital-era companies can reinvigorate their game plans and capture the new opportunities of the digital world.Rogers shows why traditional businesses need to rethink their underlying assumptions in five domains of strategy—customers, competition, data, innovation, and value. He reveals how to harness customer networks, platforms, big data, rapid experimentation, and disruptive business models—and how to integrate these into your existing business and organization.Rogers illustrates every strategy in this playbook with real-world case studies, from Google to GE, from Airbnb to the New York Times. With practical frameworks and nine step-by-step planning tools, he distills the lessons of today's greatest digital innovators and makes them usable for businesses at any stage.Many books offer advice for digital start-ups, but The Digital Transformation Playbook is the first complete treatment of how legacy businesses can transform to thrive in the digital age. It is an indispensable guide for executives looking to take their firms to the next stage of profitable growth.More DetailsISBN:9780231175449Table of ContentsFrom the BookThe five domains of digital transformation: customers, competition, data, innovation, value  Harness customer networks  Build platforms, not just products  Turn data into assets  Innovate by rapid experimentation  Adapt your value proposition  Mastering disruptive business models  Conclusion  Self-assessment: are you ready for digital transformation?

				"Rethink your business for the digital age,"--Amazon.com.
"Every business begun before the Internet now faces the same challenge: How to transform to compete in a digital economy? Globally recognized digital expert David L. Rogers argues that digital transformation is not about updating your technology but about upgrading your strategic thinking. Based on Rogers's decade of research and teaching at Columbia Business School, and his consulting for businesses around the world, The Digital Transformation Playbook shows how pre-digital-era companies can reinvigorate their game plans and capture the new opportunities of the digital world. Rogers shows why traditional businesses need to rethink their underlying assumptions in five domains of strategy--customers, competition, data, innovation, and value. He reveals how to harness customer networks, platforms, big data, rapid experimentation, and disruptive business models--and how to integrate these into your existing business and organization. Rogers illustrates every strategy in this playbook with real-world case studies, from Google to GE, from Airbnb to the New York Times. With practical frameworks and nine step-by-step planning tools, he distills the lessons of today's greatest digital innovators and makes them usable for businesses at any stage. Many books offer advice for digital start-ups, but The Digital Transformation Playbook is the first complete treatment of how legacy businesses can transform to thrive in the digital age. It is an indispensable guide for executives looking to take their firms to the next stage of profitable growth." -- Publisher's description
