Plastc
Important Notice

We Regret to Inform You...
For the past 3 years, our mission here at Plastc was to build and deliver the most technically ambitious smart card on the planet. After making enormous leaps in development, product innovation and progress towards our goal, Plastc has exhausted all of its options to raise the money it needs to continue.


Plastc, Inc. is exploring options to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and will cease operations on April 20, 2017.


While we have fallen short of our goal, we are proud of our team and the effort that went into developing a working Plastc Card. However, without the necessary capital to continue, all employees have been let go, which means that Customer Care and Social Media channels are unmanned or have been shut down.


How We Got Here:
We were expecting to close a $3.5 million Series A funding round on February 28, 2017. There are functioning Plastc Cards, which were demonstrated to our investors and our backers, and the capital was to be allocated for the mass production and shipping of Plastc Cards to pre-order customers. At first, the principal investment group postponed their investment and a couple of weeks later the round fell apart.


After the initial funding was unavailable, Plastc made progress with another investor who offered $6.75 million. This deal was scheduled to close last week and would propel development across the finish line, as well as allow for Plastc Card pre-orders to be shipped and for production to continue into a retail phase.


However, once again at the very last minute, our investor gave us notice that they have decided rescind their investment offer. The round was a signature away from closing and we were extremely caught off guard when they notified us yesterday they were backing out. Our existing investors kept us alive and functioning as long as they could during this fundraising process, but in the end, we needed new outside capital to get into production.


What This Means For Backers:
It’s been a long road with a lot of obstacles. The support of our amazing backers has been incredible, which makes this announcement even harder. We were so incredibly ready for production in order to hit our deadlines but without capital it is impossible for us to move forward and we will not be able to fulfill any pre-orders.


We are disappointed and emotionally distraught, and while we know this is extremely disappointing for you, we want our backers to know that we did everything we could to make Plastc Card a reality.

All About Sherwood...
Sherwood Industries Inc. began as a small family business in 1975.  We
							began with the manufacturing of foams for use as speaker surrounds.
							Sherwood Industries Inc. has supplied the speaker industry with the
							highest quality foams for over 30 years now.  We created specialized
							polyester and polyether foams that were designed especially for use for
							speaker surrounds.
						

Within a year of our inception, our U.S. sales grew
							and we began exporting our foams to Japan, Taiwan, and Korea.  All our
							growth has come through word of mouth and satisfied customers.  Our
							exports soon grew to include customers in Europe and China (and other
							countries in Asia) and our product line grew as well to include Water
							Resistant Foams and Santoprene Rubber.
						

Our Water Resistant Foams will
							hold a 5% soapy water solution for over 24 hours and additionally will
							hold plain water indefinitely.  Our Water Resistant Foams are now sold
							in all corners of the world and used in a multitude of applications.  
							The same holds true for our Santoprene Extrusion.  We currently
							manufacture large volumes of Santoprene Sheets for speaker surrounds,
							gaskets, and multiple industry applications worldwide including
							automotive.   Now we are proud to introduce our newest product line with
							Profile Extrusion.
						


We pride ourselves on providing the highest quality products and service
							to all of our customers.

Our proprietary software and automated manufacturing processes allow for quick-turn injection molding, CNC machining and additive manufacturing. Within our three services, we have multiple rapid prototyping and production processes to choose from. Each process serves a distinct purpose, from concept models to form, fit and function testing to short-run production that bridges the gap to large-scale manufacturing.
Product developers can upload their 3D CAD model online and receive an interactive quote with free design analysis and real-time pricing information within hours. The manufacturability analysis helps customers eliminate problems, like sink or internal undercuts, during prototyping so modifications can be made early and often. It’s an iterative process that lets designers and engineers avoid development speed bumps, so they can get their products to market as fast as possible.

They are interested in getting parts to their customers quick - the basis for their company philosophy.   Strengths:  The great thing is Protolabs/ First Cut is their extremely fast with parts.   For a small fee you can have your parts expedited in a week.  They are interested in getting parts to their customers quick - the basis for their company philosophy.   Needs to improve:  They cannot hold tight tolerances on the parts.   They do have a limit on the overall size for their parts - at the time it was less then 8" in length.   That may have changed as I have not used them within the last year or so.  Again they cannot get second operations or sourcing done.

Have ordered from them more than once and will continue if I need one-off or low quantity parts.  Great for manufacturing fixtures.   Strengths:  The whole process is quick and seamless.  The Quoting Process is quick and accurate.  Costs are competitive and you get charged what the quoting system says.  The orders can be made online and parts ship when made.   Needs to improve:  Biggest weakness is that they offer no inspection services that I am aware of.  The tolerances are a bit generous as well.  So, it's not good for precision parts.
Other weaknesses are that they don't have a Mac version of the part visualization plug-in and are ISO 13485 certified.

They live up to their slogan. Some limitations when it comes to large parts, like panels for instruments, and I wish that they were able to do this at at low costs as well. Also some limitations on hard metals, but if you want small parts in plastic or aluminum, these guys are hard to beat.   Strengths:  Fast turnaround, accurate parts, great quality   Needs to improve:  Extremely expensive for larger parts (greater than ~8x8"), i.e. if you wanted panels        Comment      0      0          Share     LinkedIn    Facebook    Twitter    Google Plus    Email                   Good Lead times - Fast Turn           backa      Manufacturing,  Medical Device 08/01/2015       Speed 4 /  Price 4 /  Quality 3     3D Printing   Metal CNC Machining   Plastic CNC Machining   CNC Prototypes   SLA - Stereolithography      Fast Turn - Price is competitive - On Time Delievery is good - Quality is Fair   Strengths:  Our R&D department use TapProtolabs/ First Cut as a source for their prototypes.

The customer service is wonderful to experience and the prototypes arrive even quicker than quoted.  I only had one issue with a customer fixture that a hole wasn't cut through and the customer service department very quickly fixed the problem.  I appreciate a company that will go the extra mile like Proto Labs/ First Cut.

Strengths:  Very fast machining of plastic and metal parts.   Needs to improve:  Firstcut does not always offer secondary operations such as threading.  Not a big deal given the very rapid turnaround and the fact that one can very easily do this on their own.

Custom Plastic Tanks
Plastic Tanks in Various Material Options: Kynar (PVDF), Lexan, PP, PVC, CPVC, & More!
Miller Plastics' custom plastic tanks range in size from less than 1 cubic foot to more than 50 feet long.
Corrosive or harsh chemical environments require tanks with unique features.
We design and construct plastic tanks to meet the most demanding specifications.
Many of our custom-fabricated plastic tanks are annealed for maximum strength.
At Miller Plastics, we have 40+ years of experience creating single tanks, as well as integrated systems that include process piping or ancillary features for a specific manufacturing process.
All of our plastic tanks are fabricated with 100% virgin American-made materials.
Self-supporting tanks can be reinforced with plastic-encapsulated steel bands or internal baffles to minimize sidewall bowing. Welds are smooth and burr-free to minimize sediment buildup and allow for easy cleaning.
We manufacture plastic tanks in a wide range of shapes, sizes and dimensions in corrosion-resistant materials for a variety of uses in harsh environments.
Plastic Tank Materials


Polypropylene - superior working temperature and tensile strength
Lexan®  - outstanding mechanical, optical, electrical and thermal properties 
PVC - Polyvinyl chloride known for its inexpensive nature and flexibility
Polyethylene - Low Density (LDPE), High Density (HDPE) and Ultra High Molecular Weight (UHMW PE)
CPVC - low cost, high glass transition temperature, high heat distortion temperature, chemical inertness, and flame and smoke properties.
Kynar® - for applications requiring the highest purity, strength, and resistance to solvents, acids, bases and heat


Plastic Tank Applications



Corrosion-Resistant Tanks
Plating Tanks
Acid Tanks
Marine Water Tanks
Process Tanks
Pickling Tanks

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
