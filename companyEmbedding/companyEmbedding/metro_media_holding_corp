The above figures represent only estimated costs. However management believes
that they will be able to cover our general and/or administrative expenses if
sufficient offering proceeds are not obtained. This expected use of net proceeds
from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the status of and results
from operations. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary
or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and
we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this
offering. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will need to secure additional
funding for the fully implement our business plan.

In the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would
utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority:

. for general and administrative expenses, including legal and accounting fees
  and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting
  obligations with the SEC

. for sales and marketing; and

. for development of new services.

Our principal office is located at 205 D. Chubb Avenue, Suite 240, Lyndhurst,
NJ. Our telephone number is 201-281-2211. These offices are provided free of
charge by Mr. Andy Altahawi, our Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and
Director. Mr. Altahawi has indicated to us that she does not intend to charge
the Issuer rent for use of such space at anytime in the future. Should the
Issuer raise sufficient capital, it expects to rent space in the vicinity of our
current office space. Leases for space suitable to conduct our operations at a
nominal level would begin at approximately $2,500 per month.


We face significant competition from larger, more established television
programming providers as well as a la carte programming providers. The majority
of our competition are better capitalized and have captured a larger share of
the market. While there can be no assurances that the company will ever be able
to compete effectively, maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or
increase its market share, based on its competitive strengths, the Company
believes that it can develop a niche programming option to operate in this
highly competitive industry. The ability to do so, however, depends upon the
company’s ability to, among other things, raise sufficient capital to make
additional acquisitions and provide for programming that will appeal to our
target markets.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. However management believes
that they will be able to cover our general and/or administrative expenses if
sufficient offering proceeds are not obtained. This expected use of net proceeds
from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the status of and results
from operations. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary
or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and
we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this
offering. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will need to secure additional
funding for the fully implement our business plan.

In the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would
utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority:

. for general and administrative expenses, including legal and accounting fees
  and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting
  obligations with the SEC

. for sales and marketing; and

. for development of new services.

Our principal office is located at 205 D. Chubb Avenue, Suite 240, Lyndhurst,
NJ. Our telephone number is 201-281-2211. These offices are provided free of
charge by Mr. Andy Altahawi, our Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and
Director. Mr. Altahawi has indicated to us that she does not intend to charge
the Issuer rent for use of such space at anytime in the future. Should the
Issuer raise sufficient capital, it expects to rent space in the vicinity of our
current office space. Leases for space suitable to conduct our operations at a
nominal level would begin at approximately $2,500 per month.


We face significant competition from larger, more established television
programming providers as well as a la carte programming providers. The majority
of our competition are better capitalized and have captured a larger share of
the market. While there can be no assurances that the company will ever be able
to compete effectively, maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or
increase its market share, based on its competitive strengths, the Company
believes that it can develop a niche programming option to operate in this
highly competitive industry. The ability to do so, however, depends upon the
company’s ability to, among other things, raise sufficient capital to make
additional acquisitions and provide for programming that will appeal to our
target markets.
