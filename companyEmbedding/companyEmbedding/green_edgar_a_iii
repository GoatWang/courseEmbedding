Considered to be a founder of Impressionism, Degas (1834 – 1917) nonetheless rejected the movement’s penchant for painting outdoors and portraying natural light. Intent on capturing poses as natural and spontaneous as a photograph, his studies of female dancers are celebrated as supreme masterpieces and mark him as an innovator in his own right. Degas completed paintings in his studio that originated as sketches of living models, strongly influencing later artists such as Picasso and Toulouse-Lautrec.Read MoreItem# 12916173497AReviewsGuarantee & ReturnsBackDetailsReviewsCommentsProduct DetailsThis giclée print offers beautiful color accuracy on a high-quality paper (235 gsm) that is a great option for framing with its smooth, acid free surface.
