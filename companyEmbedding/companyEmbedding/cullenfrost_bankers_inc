Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc. reported a 20.2 percent increase in profit for second quarter 2017 compared with the same quarter last year, which it attributed to strong loan growth.
The San Antonio-based bank holding company earned $83.5 million, or $1.29 per share, up from $69.5 million, or $1.11 per share, in second quarter 2016, according to its earnings release Thursday.

"We continue to benefit from increases in loan volumes throughout our portfolio, and we're well-positioned as interest rates rise," Cullen/Frost Chairman and CEO Phil Green said in a statement.




Green said Cullen/Frost (NYSE: CFR) continues to build momentum and is expanding in Texas. The company opened a new financial center in the Houston area at the end of the second quarter and one in Tarrant County at the start of the third quarter.
"Along with this growth, we've never lost sight of the ideals that made us successful," Green said. "In April, we increased our dividend by 3 cents to 57 cents per share, marking the 24th consecutive year of dividend increases.”
Cullen/Frost's net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis for the recent quarter increased 12.1 percent compared with the same quarter of 2016 — to $258 million from $230.2 million.
Also for the second quarter, average loans increased 6.4 percent to $12.3 billion from the $11.5 billion reported for second quarter 2016.
Cullen/Frost Banking is a financial holding company with $30.2 billion in assets as of June 30.

Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc. reported a 20.2 percent increase in profit for second quarter 2017 compared with the same quarter last year, which it attributed to strong loan growth.
The San Antonio-based bank holding company earned $83.5 million, or $1.29 per share, up from $69.5 million, or $1.11 per share, in second quarter 2016, according to its earnings release Thursday.

"We continue to benefit from increases in loan volumes throughout our portfolio, and we're well-positioned as interest rates rise," Cullen/Frost Chairman and CEO Phil Green said in a statement.




Green said Cullen/Frost (NYSE: CFR) continues to build momentum and is expanding in Texas. The company opened a new financial center in the Houston area at the end of the second quarter and one in Tarrant County at the start of the third quarter.
"Along with this growth, we've never lost sight of the ideals that made us successful," Green said. "In April, we increased our dividend by 3 cents to 57 cents per share, marking the 24th consecutive year of dividend increases.”
Cullen/Frost's net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis for the recent quarter increased 12.1 percent compared with the same quarter of 2016 — to $258 million from $230.2 million.
Also for the second quarter, average loans increased 6.4 percent to $12.3 billion from the $11.5 billion reported for second quarter 2016.
Cullen/Frost Banking is a financial holding company with $30.2 billion in assets as of June 30.

History[edit]
Early years and growth[edit]
The bank was founded in 1868 in San Antonio by Col. Thomas Claiborne (T.C.) Frost. Since then it has acquired many other Texas banks. In 1977, Frost Bank Corp. and Cullen Bankers, Inc. of Houston merged, forming the holding company, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
In 1982 Cullen/Frost Bankers and United States National Bancshares, Inc. (USNB) of Galveston, Texas merged, but Frost operated USNB separately for nearly two decades.[4][5] As new financial services legislation allowed banks to broaden the services they offered customers, Cullen/Frost folded the USNB charter into Frost's in 2000.[6] With this action, the last bank using the federally forbidden United States National Bank title ceased to exist.[5]
Recent developments[edit]




Frost Bank is headquartered in Downtown San Antonio.


Growing through the years, Frost was the 10th largest bank headquartered in Texas in the early 1980s. A decade later, it would be the biggest. As energy prices plunged, real estate slumped and the banking industry collapsed, Frost emerged as the only one of the top-10 banks based in Texas to survive intact, without federal assistance or a merger with an out-of-state financial institution.
Frost was the first bank in the nation to decline TARP bailout funds during the financial crisis of 2008 and has more than doubled in asset size since year-end 2007 by growing its banking, investments and insurance business. On December 31, 2014, Frost Bank had $28.6 billion in assets, $35.6 billion in combined trust, brokerage and advisory assets, and 126 locations in the San Antonio, Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Rio Grande Valley and Permian Basin regions.[7]
This growth has solidified the company’s Texas base and fueled an expansion of services. Today, Frost offers a broad range of financial services, including business and consumer banking; investment, trust, retirement and financial management services; insurance and investment banking.
Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. was originally listed on NASDAQ in 1977, but began trading under the symbol "CFR" on the New York Stock Exchange in 1997.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Early years and growth[edit]
The bank was founded in 1868 in San Antonio by Col. Thomas Claiborne (T.C.) Frost. Since then it has acquired many other Texas banks. In 1977, Frost Bank Corp. and Cullen Bankers, Inc. of Houston merged, forming the holding company, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
In 1982 Cullen/Frost Bankers and United States National Bancshares, Inc. (USNB) of Galveston, Texas merged, but Frost operated USNB separately for nearly two decades.[4][5] As new financial services legislation allowed banks to broaden the services they offered customers, Cullen/Frost folded the USNB charter into Frost's in 2000.[6] With this action, the last bank using the federally forbidden United States National Bank title ceased to exist.[5]
Recent developments[edit]




Frost Bank is headquartered in Downtown San Antonio.


Growing through the years, Frost was the 10th largest bank headquartered in Texas in the early 1980s. A decade later, it would be the biggest. As energy prices plunged, real estate slumped and the banking industry collapsed, Frost emerged as the only one of the top-10 banks based in Texas to survive intact, without federal assistance or a merger with an out-of-state financial institution.
Frost was the first bank in the nation to decline TARP bailout funds during the financial crisis of 2008 and has more than doubled in asset size since year-end 2007 by growing its banking, investments and insurance business. On December 31, 2014, Frost Bank had $28.6 billion in assets, $35.6 billion in combined trust, brokerage and advisory assets, and 126 locations in the San Antonio, Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Rio Grande Valley and Permian Basin regions.[7]
This growth has solidified the company’s Texas base and fueled an expansion of services. Today, Frost offers a broad range of financial services, including business and consumer banking; investment, trust, retirement and financial management services; insurance and investment banking.
Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. was originally listed on NASDAQ in 1977, but began trading under the symbol "CFR" on the New York Stock Exchange in 1997.[citation needed]

Style Scores:



B Value | D Growth | D Momentum | C VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
