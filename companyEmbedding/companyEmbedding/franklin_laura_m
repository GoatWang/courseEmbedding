I've had horrible luck with one of the big regional chain store selling me windows. See my other reviews for all the details. Franklin Glass was recommended to my by a neighbor. I called and a few days later they came out and with in a week I had a quote. It was higher than a few other quotes that I had gotten but I was looking for a local company with a good product. Reputation and being a locally owned business was more important to me than price. I felt confident and confirmed my order. A few weeks later my windows were installed. The crew was courteous, respectful and were more than happy to tweak a few things for us. They even came back the next day at no additional charge. They cleaned up after them selves too! I would highly recommend them and will hire them again when I am ready to replace a few more windows.
The windows are Harvey windows and beautiful! I am so so happy with them!







Wonderful company to do business with. My garden window was damaged due to lovely ice dam damage. Two different companies said it was not fixable. Emailed pictures to Franklin Glass, and they were able to get it back as good as new (and it's 25 years old). So professional, great communication, reasonable pricing. Everything was done exactly as promised. Can't recommend them enough.

I've had horrible luck with one of the big regional chain store selling me windows. See my other reviews for all the details. Franklin Glass was recommended to my by a neighbor. I called and a few days later they came out and with in a week I had a quote. It was higher than a few other quotes that I had gotten but I was looking for a local company with a good product. Reputation and being a locally owned business was more important to me than price. I felt confident and confirmed my order. A few weeks later my windows were installed. The crew was courteous, respectful and were more than happy to tweak a few things for us. They even came back the next day at no additional charge. They cleaned up after them selves too! I would highly recommend them and will hire them again when I am ready to replace a few more windows.The windows are Harvey windows and beautiful! I am so so happy with them!

                        I feel so relieved when I find a good contractor. I've hired some fantastic ones, and I've also been burned with ones that turned out to be hacks. John, one of the 2 original owners,…

I've had horrible luck with one of the big regional chain store selling me windows. See my other reviews for all the details. Franklin Glass was recommended to my by a neighbor. I called and a few days later they came out and with in a week I had a quote. It was higher than a few other quotes that I had gotten but I was looking for a local company with a good product. Reputation and being a locally owned business was more important to me than price. I felt confident and confirmed my order. A few weeks later my windows were installed. The crew was courteous, respectful and were more than happy to tweak a few things for us. They even came back the next day at no additional charge. They cleaned up after them selves too! I would highly recommend them and will hire them again when I am ready to replace a few more windows.
The windows are Harvey windows and beautiful! I am so so happy with them!







Wonderful company to do business with. My garden window was damaged due to lovely ice dam damage. Two different companies said it was not fixable. Emailed pictures to Franklin Glass, and they were able to get it back as good as new (and it's 25 years old). So professional, great communication, reasonable pricing. Everything was done exactly as promised. Can't recommend them enough.

Wonderful company to do business with. My garden window was damaged due to lovely ice dam damage. Two different companies said it was not fixable. Emailed pictures to Franklin Glass, and they were able to get it back as good as new (and it's 25 years old). So professional, great communication, reasonable pricing. Everything was done exactly as promised. Can't recommend them enough.

Franklin B. Krohn & Laura M. Milner


Journal of Business Ethics 8 (10):773 - 780 (1989)





Abstract



The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how condom manufacturers and their marketers have failed to adequately promote their product to the male homosexual population (gays). Inasmuch as the AIDS syndrome constitutes a major life-threatening danger and that gays appear to be particularly vulnerable, failure to aggressively promote a known preventive such as condoms to gays constitutes negligent homicide.The method used here defines what is traditionally viewed as a viable target market, analyzes the major elements of marketing with regard to gays, and examines the neglect of condom promotion by their manufacturers.
