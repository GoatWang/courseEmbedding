LAGUNA BEACH, Calif., April 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- A group of iPass Inc. (NASDAQ:   IPAS) ("iPass" or the "Company") investors, led by Maguire Asset Management, Francis Capital Management, and Foxhill Opportunity Fund, who collectively own approximately 7.7% of iPass' shares outstanding, announced today that they have combined to form "iPass Shareholders for Change" and that they will be seeking to reconstitute the Board of Directors of iPass (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2015 Annual Meeting, which is expected to be held in June.  iPass Shareholders for Change also announced today that it has issued an open letter to iPass shareholders in which the group, among other things, details how certain of its members have attempted for many years to work constructively with the Board to improve the Company's performance and governance, enhance value and restore investor confidence, but to no avail. Also in the letter, the investor group expresses its profound disappointment with the failure of leadership at iPass under the current Board, and the group's belief that new leadership is not only warranted at iPass, but long overdue.  To that end, iPass Shareholders for Change expects to file later today preliminary proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the election of five new, highly-qualified director nominees at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  iPass Shareholders for Change's director nominees are Richard A. Karp, Brent S. Morrison, Damien J. Park, Norman J. Rice, III and Kenneth H. Traub.  Bios for each of the director nominees are included in the letter below. 
The full text of the letter:
Open Letter to iPass Shareholders
April 16, 2015
Dear Fellow iPass Shareholder:
We are a group of concerned investors of iPass Inc. ("iPass" or the "Company") who have organized as iPass Shareholders for Change. We collectively own an aggregate of 5,090,221 shares of common stock of iPass, constituting approximately 7.7% of the Company's shares outstanding.  Over the past seven years certain members of our investment group have attempted to maintain a constructive and cordial relationship with the Company's management and members of the Board of Directors (the "Board") with the hope that our value improvement recommendations would be taken seriously and implemented for the benefit of all shareholders.  The dialogue has covered many issues and serious concerns regarding, among other things, the Company's business strategy, underperformance, strategic alternatives review process, poor capital allocation decisions, executive compensation, bloated expenses, and poor corporate governance practices, all for the purpose of helping to fundamentally improve the business.
We are writing today to express our profound disappointment with the outcome of this engagement and with the current Board's apparent failure to protect and enhance shareholder value.  Simply put, we believe that the problematic status quo and troubling underperformance at iPass is largely a result of a failure of the Board and that new leadership is not only warranted, but long overdue.
To that end, we expect to file later today preliminary proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with our efforts to solicit your support to elect five new, highly-qualified director nominees to the Board at iPass' 2015 Annual Meeting, which is expected to take place in early June.  
Despite the multiple-failed attempts to sell the business since 2008, continually falling short of executing several different business plans, the ongoing operating losses and the alarming cash depletion, we remain confident that under the right leadership and direction iPass can generate significant value for shareholders.  As the world's largest commercial WiFi network with over 18 million access points across 120 countries, we believe iPass is a valuable yet underappreciated business supported by a dedicated group of exceptional employees. However, we believe the market will continue to apply a significant discount to iPass' market value until investor confidence is fully restored.
In our opinion, the most effective way to enhance shareholder value and to restore investor confidence is by immediately reconstituting the Board with these five seasoned, professional business leaders who have deep, relevant operational and industry experience.  If elected, our nominees will bring a fresh perspective into the boardroom, undergo a thorough examination of the recently abandoned strategic alternatives review, act as advocates for all shareholders, and ensure that management is compensated appropriately and ultimately held accountable for its performance.
iPass Shareholders for Change's Highly Qualified Nominees:
Richard Karp is a cost-conscious, savvy business professional with extensive operating experience at numerous technology companies.  Mr. Karp received a B.S. degree in science from the California Institute of Technology, a M.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin, and a Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University.  Subsequent to this, Mr. Karp managed several private and publicly-traded companies, including Catapult Communications, a manufacturer of telecom test equipment, which he founded in 1985 and took through its IPO before it was sold to Ixia in 2009 for $105 million.  Mr. Karp recently served as a director of Novatel Wireless, Inc., a leader in the design and development of MiFi technologies and M2M wireless solutions for the Internet of Things.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
