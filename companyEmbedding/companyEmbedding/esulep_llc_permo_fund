Philosophy | Esulep

























































Philosophy
Consistent success
The core philosophy of Esulep Management is to engineer successful investment and trading strategies using logic, quantitative analysis, and a deep understanding of the mechanics of capital markets and how the underlying vehicles can be utilized for success.
Each member of the management team has real trading and investment experience, focusing on the “Why” and “How” of profitable methods, through various types of market conditions and decades of experience.
Preference is given to earning small amounts from investments more likely to produce success consistently versus riskier investments with lower rates of success even if the potential profits may be larger. The agility and ability of the strategies to remain nimble and accommodative is key, as is the risk management for when (not if) things go wrong. For a given system, the risks are addressed first, and then the possible returns. The core philosophies are applicable not only to a variety of markets other than the current ones being utilized, but also to different lines of work and strategic optimizations.
Simplicity, reproducibility, authenticity of the process, and ultimate risk management.
For your portfolio goals, Know Better Investment.


PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.
FUTURES INVESTMENT INVOLVES RISK AND IS NOT SUITABLE FOR ALL INVESTORS.

Fund Investment Objectives











                                        ESULEP'S PERMO Fund is continually engineered to be an absolute-return style U.S. listed futures and options fund. The Permo Fund needs to invest only in the S&P 500 for accounts under 100M, with no additional leverage for its returns.  The fund uses proprietary analytics for its entry and exit points, and the already-hedged Core positions are hedged with two separate sub-strategy hedges to both protect gains and ensure continuity through catastrophic events.

Esulep: A strange place to find non-correlation






By Daniel P. Collins

            March 1, 2014 • Reprints 



















It may seem strange that Esulep LLC was one of the Top Traders of 2013 earning only 10.52% in a directional strategy trading the S&P 500 but on a risk-adjusted basis it outperformed all comers. 
Esulep Founder and Principal Matt Peluse says 2013 was not their best year, ironically that is attributable to the very strong environment in equities as Esulep has a correlation of -0.12 with the S&P total return index since its April 2008 launch. 
“It doesn’t matter what we use at the end of the day, we can translate the [Esulep Permo Fund] philosophy to a broad range of markets,” Peluse says. “The S&P 500 just happens to be one of the most liquid markets in the world and it has the least volatility of any of the major indices.”
He defines that philosophy as very low risk and conservative, which is clear when you measure their performance against everyone else on a risk-adjusted basis. “We assume that every trade we put on is going to be wrong and go against us and be the worst trade in the world — that is just the way we are,” Peluse says. That philosophy has served his investors well with off-the-charts risk-adjusted return performance. 
The strategy determines support and resistance levels and executes directional trades through options on the S&P 500. Peluse develops a 90-day market outlook and puts on hedges even before their actual directional trades. “We put on our hedges first and then our core positions. Everything is an option on an E-mini so if we want to go in a futures direction, we do an equivalent using options,” Peluse says.  “It is rules-based investing. We have our analytics that develop our support and resistance levels; we then have the execution signals that tell us when to put on a position.”
He says the system asks, “Where are the support levels if we start going down, where are the resistance levels if it starts going up, those sorts of things.”
Every position is hedged. “The two hedging sub-strategies are inversely correlated to the core strategy so if we have bullish cores, we have bearish hedges,” Peluse says. “We have our hedge on beforehand; just like everyone buys car and house insurance before something happens.”
The program can be bullish, bearish or market neutral. “We are not trying to hit it out of the park every time. …it is just how we do it that makes us different from virtually everybody else.”
And their performance shows this as Esulep has produced a compound annual return of 13.24% with a worst drawdown of 12.73% and a Sharpe ratio of 2.12. Esulep tends to earn its strongest returns when the underlying S&P 500 struggles.
The core positions are held 30 days or less and the hedges tends to last 45 to 90 days. “Our hedges cover the core position for the current month and the next month,” Peluse says. “It is a take what the defense gives you [approach], if the trade is going to be five ticks then we are trying to get four or five ticks; if the trade is only two ticks we are not going to try and get five ticks. Everything is based on the markets and what the markets are telling us.”
They do not put on specific spreads but build them organically. “If there is an opportunity where a butterfly is the most optimal options position then that is what we will do. We have a butterfly on right now. If the market tells us that, then we will do it. If the market tells us to have a bull call spread or a bull put spread, then we will do it; it is all based on what the market tells us to do.”
Peluse started out as an equity index trader for a proprietary firm. A year later he began his own prop trading firm with a couple of other traders. By 2007 he had developed some systematic strategies and was looking to do something new. “I decided to expand the strategies I started the previous few years and expanded the time horizon; made it an investment under management model and reduced the risk dramatically.”
He went live in April 2008, perfect timing given his non-correlation with equities. “It was an exciting year,” Peluse says. “We want to have absolute return no matter what the market does. Our benchmark is zero. In 2008 we made [15.5% in nine months], in 2010 and 2011 we also had very good years.”
And in 2013 Esulep outperformed the S&P 500 once you normalize their standard deviations, and did it with a correlation to the S&P 500 of -0.43. That is an impressive combination and bodes well for the Chicago based manager.

SummaryEsulep LLC Max invests using the Permo Investment Program,  which is an absolute-return, U.S. Listed Futures and Options Strategy. It invests exclusively in broad market equity indices (e.g. S&P 500) utilizing proprietary strategies that are dynamically updated, while adhering to a tight, capital conservation risk profile. 
Monthly performance is designed to have minimal correlation with overall S&P 500 market movement or with other managers, the gains are achieved without borrowed funds or added leverage, and the positions are hedged appropriately to both reduce the risk of capital loss and also to ensure continuity through adverse conditions.  The track record before 2012 is a composite of all Permo Strategy accounts, including the private fund with comparable returns and fee structure.  All returns are netted of 2/20 fees each month.
Investment StrategyInvestment is in broad-based U.S. equity indices, utilizing proprietary entry and exit points with positions fully hedged to major support/resistance levels using options.  Outlooks on the markets typically encompass the next 30 to 90 days, are updated continually, with portfolio adjustments as required by the risk profile based on market movement.  The program is composed of the core strategies, and two separate hedging strategies designed to protect against both monetary and catastrophic losses.  Advantages of the program include: high frequency of gains often resulting from the very small magnitude of profit desired, ability to earn gains even when the markets move against the portfolio significantly due to the multiple hedging strategies, and a zero correlation to most other investment strategies with the proprietary execution points of the positions.Risk ManagementThere are two main hedging strategies to supplement the core strategies, and the nature of the core strategies allows dissipation of potential losses over time.  Action is taken once any drawdown of 2% is reached intramonth, with additional action taken at 5%; neither double-digit gains nor losses are anticipated, though still possible.  During unpredictable times, capital conservation is favored over additional opportunistic risk.  "Fat tail" months are planned for, though not relied upon to earn profit.  Consistency is the goal, not a large APY during a given year.  Backtesting shows that approximately 99% of the months back to 1950 work well under the program, with the other 1% returning to the high water mark within 6 months (at most).  Sep '09 drawdown was due to a newly investigated hedging strategy that worked well for two complete months, before failing in September.  This hedge has since been replaced and clients benefit from the improvements.  Supplements and additional information are available to prospective clients.

Get $100 in search advertising when you spend $25 in Bing Ads.


†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

                        There are substantial risks and conflicts of interests associated with Managed Futures and commodities accounts, and you should only invest risk capital. The success of an investment is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (CTA) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. CTAs have total trading authority, and the use of a single CTA could mean a lack of diversification and higher risk. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in commodity trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses as well as gains. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. If you use notional funding, you may lose more than your initial cash investment. Managed Futures and commodities accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. The disclosure document contains a complete description of each fee to be charged to your account by a CTA. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation. PAST RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.
