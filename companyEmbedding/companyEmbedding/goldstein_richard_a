Writing career[edit]
Early development[edit]
Goldstein was born to Jack and Mollye Goldstein. He was raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and in the Parkside Houses in the Bronx. His father was a postal worker, his mother a homemaker. He attended Hunter College for his undergraduate degree. Goldstein graduated from Columbia University School of Journalism in 1966, and joined the Village Voice in June of that year. He published his first book 1 in 7: Drugs on Campus in 1966. Goldstein began covering covered the emerging worlds of pop and rock music in his weekly "Pop Eye" column, establishing him one of the first rock critics. He also wrote pieces for The New York Times, New York, The Nation, Harper's Magazine, Vogue, Artforum, The Guardian, Mademoiselle, The Saturday Evening Post, and The Los Angeles Times. Assigned by the Times to review the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Goldstein wrote a negative appraisal which unleashed a backlash from Beatles fans. He left the Village Voice in 1969,[2] but he returned in the early 1970s as the paper's arts editor. He eventually became the executive editor, but he continued writing weekly for Voice, on subjects ranging from sexual politics to the lives of artists. He was the paper's media critic for several years before he left the Voice in 2004. He has issued two collections of his work, Reporting the Counterculture and Goldstein's Greatest Hits. He also released a collection of rock lyrics interspersed with notes on the aesthetic qualities of these songs, The Poetry of Rock. This book has been taught in literature classes in a number of secondary schools and universities. In addition, Goldstein's work has been widely anthologized. He is currently an adjunct professor at Hunter College of the City of New York, where he teaches courses on pop-culture theory and understanding the 1960s.
Writings on gay issues[edit]
Goldstein, who came out in the 1970s, has been a champion of gay rights and issued early calls for attention to the AIDS epidemic. Since, he has tackled the cutting-edge topic of gay assimilation and power politics with a book on the connections between liberal society and the gay right, Homocons. He famously issued a call in The Nation for Eminem to duel with him, taking exception to the controversial rapper's homophobic lyrics. Goldstein is a GLAAD-award winner for his columns on LGBT issues.[3]

        About Us          








We build relationships with our clients with an unsurpassed level of personal attention and accessibility.
 
If you’re reading this, it’s very likely you’re curious about working with us to help you protect something you’re developing.
Perhaps you are a business owner, or entrepreneur, and you’ve come up with a hot new product, service or solution that you know is going to launch you into a lucrative and exciting new business.
Yet, you probably have several questions in your mind about what’s involved in getting a patent, and probably how working with us might help you with that.

 
Just what qualifies us to answer your patent questions?
We’ve given advice to more than 10,000 inventors from all over the United States, and have obtained over 1,500 patents for clients. Many of our clients’ patents have gone on to form the basis of very successful products and companies.
So we are uniquely qualified to answer your two most important patent questions:

Can I patent it?
Should I patent it?

You’re not paying us for hype, you want the straight truth.
We take pride in helping you determine when you DON’T need a patent.
When your idea isn’t worth patenting or wouldn’t be likely to obtain a patent, we will simply tell you that.
Most likely, however, there will be several ways you can move forward with your patent project, and we can guide you every step of the way.
It’s about You… Your Ideas… Your Goals.
At Goldstein Law Offices, P.C., we have helped more than a thousand individuals, entrepreneurs, and small businesses, obtain the patents they were seeking.
We have also helped many thousands more evaluate the potential value in patent protection.
Our firm is dedicated to meeting your individual needs.
Your ideas are important to you, and we are committed to helping you determine if a patent should be a part of your plan, but also understand that filing a patent is not the right choice for every person or for every idea.
We build relationships with our clients with an unsurpassed level of personal attention and accessibility. We will give you the information that matters, even if it means that you will not need our further services.
Our clients rely on us for direct advice and strong advocacy.
Patent Law can present complex issues that require skill, communication, and patience.
We provide resources to educate you about the patent process, and give you the information you need to make good decisions.

Business Coaching: Beyond the Intellectual Property 
While you never actually need a patent, when used correctly, patents can be so helpful that they are simply invaluable to your business.

Entrepreneurs that just focus on the patent will often overlook other important factors, opportunities, planning, and steps necessary to be successful.

Consider then that the decision to invest wisely in patent protection is just one of many business decisions that  will help decide the path of your business, and its growth, success, or failure.

What Our Clients Say About Us
"My first patented invention helped me grow a single product into a company with an entire line of hair accessories and other beauty products. In the course of enforcing my patent rights against competitors, other intellectual patent attorneys have complimented me on how broadly my patent application was written."

—Mia Minnelli Kaminski


“I want people to know that you really went to bat for me when it mattered most. While most of the patents you got for me went through on the first shot, for those that didn’t: you fought hard to get them approved. As a result, my products sell around the world, and generate millions. In my book, you are the best!”

—Lou Sardo


"[Goldstein] took the time to understand my ideas and the application of these ideas... [The firm] successfully submitted and secured five United States Patents and one Trademark and all with the first submittal to the United States Patent Office. These Patents still stand today and are unbeatable..."

—Steve Ross


"After working with you for more than 12 years, I would gladly recommend your firm to anyone considering the patent process. The expertise and professional way you handled and expedited my patent cases has helped me create and protect the success I have today. The skill used in wording my patents has even helped me defend and win a lawsuit..."

—Lt. Mike Bishop


"I know of two instances where other companies were interested in duplicating my product and tried to break my patent, but gave up after their patent attorneys told them it was pointless. I now have my Eyeglass Locator on the market and it's a dream come true."

—Clarence McCurdy


“My wife and I are highly impressed with the methods and support of your team through our efforts to patent our idea. Since we were not the first to identify our idea, the evaluation process saved us a great deal of time and money. Even though we were not ultimately successful in our original goal, I feel that we are in a better position now than if we had attempted a different course of action. We have gained a great deal of valuable insights about the patent process and will use the Goldstein evaluation option for our next idea.”

—Don and Gayle McFadyen

Getting a patent is a process.
In this introductory video, in this 6 part series, patent attorney Richard Goldstein addresses the patent process for individual inventors with ideas, and outlines the different kinds of patent protection that are available.


 

Forms of protection and which one may be right for your idea
So, you had this great idea, and the next thing that popped into your mind was, “Okay, what do I do with this idea? Who do I talk to about it? I don’t know who I can trust. Can I talk to my friends about this? Can I talk to my family about this? Can I go to a company about this?”
No, don’t go to a company about it first. But yeah, that’s probably what you were thinking—”What now?” And you may have started searching the internet, looking for information about ideas and inventions and patents, and through that research, you ended up on this website—because you realize that patenting the idea might be an important step for you. Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn’t. In this series, we’ll help you figure that out.
One thing many of our clients have in common is that they never intended to become inventors. They just came up with an idea and found themselves in a position where they needed to learn what they needed to do in order to pursue that idea—and probably even figure out whether they should be pursuing the idea at all. This series addresses the most common questions you may have about the patent process, and what you can do next.
Now that you have an idea, the next question is, what’s the appropriate way to go about protecting your particular idea? Under the law, there are different ways of protecting different types of ideas. You’ve probably heard of some of them—things like patents, trademarks, and copyrights. All of those fit within an area of the law known as “intellectual property law.” That’s the field of law that deals with the protection of ideas, the ownership of ideas. So what we need to figure out is, what’s the right way for you to own the idea that you’ve come up with?
The first form of protection we should talk about is copyright law. And we’ll talk about it quickly because copyright probably doesn’t apply to your situation, but you should understand why. You’ve probably heard people say, “Hey, that’s a great idea! You should copyright it!” So we’ll explain why that probably doesn’t apply to your situation.
Copyright does not protect ideas. Copyright protects artistic expression. Copyright protects things like books, movies, plays, poetry, and songs—and even in those things, it doesn’t protect the underlying idea. So if you have an idea for a book, the idea itself is not protected with a copyright. But the words you write for the book might be protected. So, even with the right subject matter—the book, a copyright doesn’t protect the idea—just the way you wrote that particular book.
The second form of protection we’re going to talk about is trademark. Trademark law helps consumers not to be confused about where their product is coming from. So, when you go into a store to buy a can of Coca-Cola®, and you see a can that’s labeled “Coca-Cola,” you can count on the fact that it’s “The Real Thing®,” as they put it, because trademark law protects your expectation as a consumer that a product labeled “Coca-Cola” is Coca-Cola®.
Trademark law protects anything that a company might use to identify their product or service in the marketplace. It could be the name “Coca-Cola,” it could be the writing style on the can, it could be the red and white color scheme on the can, or that wavy line, or even the slogan, “The Real Thing®.” Those are all trademarks of Coca-Cola because those are all things that, if they were all put on a competitor’s product, a consumer might be confused into thinking that the competitors product was Coca-Cola®—or somehow affiliated with them.
The key thing for you to understand right now about trademark law is that it might apply to you if the thing that’s most important about what you have is the name of it—the name you come up with, the slogan, or other aspects that are distinct from the product idea itself. Or it might be something that you need to consider later on, when you’re about to launch your product.
What you should know for now is that, if what you have in mind is the idea for a product, a service, or something like a smart phone app, that you believe is distinct from other things that already exist, patent law is probably the area of law that pertains to protecting your idea. Patents protect new and useful inventions that fit certain specific criteria that the patent office looks for when deciding whether to grant a patent. We’ll discuss these criteria in greater detail in this series.
Part 2 of this series discusses the two most important criteria for determining whether you can patent what you have.

Coca-Cola® is a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company.

        Agile Patenting®          









Protect it Quickly and As it Develops – Agile Patenting®
Success in business often requires a nimble approach to product development.
Sometimes development and execution are simultaneous in highly competitive fields, with the goal of getting the product out in the market quickly.  You may have heard of “agile software development” as a methodology for developing software apps. Developers begin writing code even while they are still working out the details of how the app works.
Agile Patenting® is a methodology created by Rich Goldstein that is a nimble approach to obtaining patent protection for ideas that moving quickly along the path from concept to market.  The goal is to protect the core idea at an early stage AND protect improvements and enhancements as the product is developed and launched.
Like agile software development, Agile Patenting® is:

RESPONSIVE
ITERATIVE & INCREMENTAL
EVOLUTIONARY
ADAPTIVE.

RESPONSIVE
Agile Patenting® has developed in response to changes in US patent law in 2013 and to the expanding global marketplace for patented inventions.
US patent law now grants patent protection to the inventor who files first, the “first to file system.”
Waiting for the details to be worked out before filing in highly competitive markets may make you too late. Agile Patenting® starts the patent application process as soon as your idea has sufficiently developed but not necessarily in full detail.  We lock in an early priority date in the US.
Your US filing date can also transfer abroad.
Unlike the US, most other countries require that a patent application be filed before any invention is introduced into the marketplace, a requirement called “absolute novelty.” In response to clients’ desire to obtain more global protection, the early start of the patent application process preserves clients’ international rights before introducing the idea to the public.
ITERATIVE and INCREMENTAL
Agile Patenting begins with filing a US provisional patent application, effectively “dropping an anchor” for you on that date in the first to file system and in the international patent treaty system.
As your product or ideas move along through development, details are added iteratively in subsequent provisional patent applications, each application adding incremental elements to the original concept.   By the end of the year after the first application filing, a non-provisional utility application is filed referencing all the provisional patent applications, establishing priority dates for all aspects to date.
EVOLUTIONARY
Ideas never move linearly through the development process.
As your project moves forward, new directions can be captured in subsequent filings.  When protecting an idea or invention, it is important to capture those branches into a patent application.  What may seem to be a diversion or a dead end for the final product, when added to the growing body of applications in the project actually becomes more complete protection. Working around your invention will be much harder for the competition if you have blocked most avenues in your applications.
ADAPTIVE
Most projects start with research to identify what, if any, patent protection may be available for your idea.
Most projects start with research to identify what if any patent protection may be available. Some projects may start with a “cover letter” provisional to preserve US and foreign rights, followed by research.  Some projects may require one or two provisional patent applications to capture and fully disclose the invention.  Others may require filing an application every month.
At Goldstein Patent Law, we customize our approach to your project.
Similar to practice in agile software development, only experienced patent attorneys are assigned to your case.  With a thorough knowledge of US and international patent law, our attorneys guide you nimbly and agilely through the maze of obtaining patent protection for your idea.
