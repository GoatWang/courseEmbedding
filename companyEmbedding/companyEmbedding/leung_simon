About Simon Leung

Simon Leung, known all across the Internet Marketing industry as the Google Insider, is one of the world‚Äôs leading experts in Search Engine Marketing, Search Engine Optimization and Social Media Marketing.
Corporate Career
In April of 2002, back when very few people have even heard about Google.com, Simon became one of the very first individuals to join the Google AdWords team. For several months, he was one of the highest performers in his role as an AdWords Representative, also known as an Editorial Specialist, manually going through thousands upon thousands of ads at any given week, which gave him the opportunity to ramp up on the Google AdWords product at a very early stage in his career.
After mastering the basic skills of Google AdWords, Simon sought his next challenge as an AdWords Email Coordinator, where he once again became one of the highest performers on his team, cranking through an average of over 100 customer emails on a daily basis. In addition, Simon even managed customer support over the phone and in the Chinese language, even though the official Phone and International Teams had not been established yet at the time.
Finally, in May of 2003, Simon found his niche. For several months, Simon had been very interested in optimizing clients‚Äô Google AdWords accounts and often pro-actively sent optimization suggestions over email and phone. At last, an official Optimization Specialist position would roll out, and there would be an opportunity to transition into this position full-time.
However, at the time, there was no Optimization Team. There weren‚Äôt even any training or real, tested strategies that have been proven to work. As a matter of fact, he would only be working on optimizations with one other colleague, which was someone who had joined the AdWords Team a few months after him.
Despite the challenges, Simon worked hard not only to optimize accounts and support clients, but also became instrumental in the testing and developing the very strategies that are proven to work today. In addition to external client support, Simon also wrote most of the optimization training materials for new AdWords and Optimization Team members, many of which are still being used internally at Google to this day.
Ever since then, Simon was not only once again one of the highest performing members of the team, but he also became a leading contributor, trainer, mentor and quality reviewer for all his colleagues. He later became a contributing Founder to the Google AdWords Agency Team, and founded most of the projects that have been valuable to both clients and his team, and he had become the #1 go-to person on the team with optimization quality and strategy questions.
As an Optimization Specialist, Simon was a tremendous resource internally and externally, working with 100s of advertisers with all types of problems and successfully helped them achieve their advertising goals. Having improved the performances of 1000s of accounts, many of which were new campaigns created from scratch, Simon had tested and developed countless strategies with his team and know the insides as to what techniques produce results.
Entrepreneurship
In August of 2006, Simon felt that he had exhausted his learning during his employment at Google, and made the decision to resign from the company recognized as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs best search engine‚Äù in search of his next challenge.
Within just two weeks into his transition into a full-time Internet entrepreneur, Simon has already become a:

Recognized expert among the top Internet Marketing gurus
Platform speaker at major Internet Marketing seminars
Contributor in major product launches by big name speakers
Special guest on high profile teleseminar calls
JV partner in several new and upcoming projects
Creator of several more ground-breaking products of his own

And obviously, Simon has only begun to scratch the surface‚Ä¶
There are a ton of Google AdWords advertisers out there who are frustrated with their advertising efforts, and so much more who would benefit from services of all types of levels. Simon has now dedicated himself to helping such advertisers in a role and angle that he could not have possibly been able to do during his Google employment.
As an entrepreneur, Simon has mastered the marketing skills that has allowed him to generate five to six figures in a single month. In his first year in business, Simon built a half a million dollar company from the ground up, and hitting the million dollar mark shortly into his second year in business, with additional success growing daily.
Today, Simon has expanded his expertise into countless areas of Internet Marketing, building companies, partnerships and teams all around the world. In addition, he teaches fellow entrepreneurs how to achieve the same success as full-time Internet Marketers. As a consultant, author, speaker, coach and mentor, Simon has built over 10,000 success stories worldwide. He is also the author of several physical and digital books, courses, audio and video products, with many more similar products on the way. Simon will also continue to be an expert speaker at some of the highest profile Internet Marketing Seminars in the industry worldwide this year.
