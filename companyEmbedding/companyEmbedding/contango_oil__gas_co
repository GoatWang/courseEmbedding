Age verification rule for adult websites
17 Juillet 2017



The watchdog, which many assume will be the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), will be able to fine providers up to £250,000, or up to 5 percent of the turnover reported in their "most recent complete accounting period".Also waiting to be finalised are details of how enforcement would work.It will have the power to dish out fines of up to £250,000 for non-compliance, cut loose misbehaving porn operators from their payment providers, advertisers, and other ancillary services that they use in the United Kingdom, or they could be blocked by ISPs-a method that the government's DCMS parliamentary under-secretary Lord Ashton previously insisted "would be used sparingly"."Sex websites could require users to provide details from their credit card, which cannot be legally issued anyone under 18", continues the paper, adding that gambling websites use a similar system. The system should be in place by April of 2018, along with the ludicrous idea of the official governmentally approved porn regulator.The digital minister, Matt Hancock, who will introduce the bill in the House of Commons on Monday, said: "Now we are taking the next step to put in place the legal requirement for websites with adult content to ensure it is safely behind an age verification control".Mr Hancock said: "All this means that while we can enjoy the freedom of the web, the United Kingdom will have the most robust internet child protection measures of any country in the world".
South Korea proposes rare military talks with North
The last time Seoul held government talks with Pyongyang was in August 2015 under the former Park Geun-hye administration. But he has achieved little progress, with North Korea test-firing a series of newly developed missiles.
As per NSPCC, over 1 million children are estimated to view porn online through free websites."Protecting children from exposure, including accidental exposure, to adult content is incredibly important, given the effect it can have", he said. Steps like this to help restrict access, alongside the provision of free parental controls and education, are key. "It is essential to help".While the Digital Economy Act became law in April, a number of groups have criticised the legislation for being draconian and breaching the privacy of their users."The Government has repeatedly refused to ensure that there is a legal duty for age verification providers to protect the privacy of web users", executive director Jim Killock said.Information Commissioner Ms Denham also highlighted concerns about any age verification that required the collection and retention of documents such as a copy of passports, driving licences, or other documents vulnerable to misuse or attractive to disreputable third parties."Age verification risks failure as it attempts to fix a social problem with technology".

	NEWS RELEASE




	 




	Contango Updates Southern Delaware Basin Operations




	 




	May 24, 2017 – HOUSTON, TEXAS – Contango Oil & Gas Company (NYSE MKT: MCF) (“Contango”) announced today results on its second and third wells drilled on its Southern Delaware Basin acreage in Pecos County, Texas.       




	As previously reported,  the Rude Ram #1H and Ripper State #1H were drilled from a common surface location approximately one mile south of the Lonestar Gunfighter #1, our first well in this area. Both wells targeted different landing zones within the Wolfcamp A  and were completed in late April with initial  flowback commencing shortly thereafter.  After 30 days of flowback, the Rude Ram, which targeted the Upper Wolfcamp A, reached a maximum 24-hour IP rate of 1,304 Boed  (69%  oil), while the Ripper State, which targeted the Middle Wolfcamp A, reached a maximum 24-hour IP rate of 1,131Boed (73%  oil).  These rates compare favorably to the 966 Boed maximum 24-hour IP rate previously disclosed for the Lonestar Gunfighter well which targeted the Middle Wolfcamp A. 




	The Gunner #2H, our fourth horizontal well, approximately two miles southeast of the Lonestar Gunfighter, has been drilled to the kickoff point at 9,735 feet and is being prepared for the drilling of a 10,000 lateral section into the Lower Wolfcamp A. 





	Contango Oil & Gas Company is a Houston, Texas based, independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, exploitation and production of crude


	oil and natural gas offshore in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico and in the onshore Texas and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. Additional information is available on the Company's website at


	http://contango.com


	.




	This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding Contango that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor "forward-looking statements" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on Contango’s current expectations and includes statements regarding acquisitions and divestitures, estimates of future production, future results of operations, quality and nature of the asset base, the assumptions upon which estimates are based and other expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, strategies or statements about future events or performance (often, but not always, using words such as "expects", “projects”, "anticipates", "plans", "estimates", "potential", "possible", "probable", or "intends", or stating that certain actions, events or results "may", "will", "should", or "could" be taken, occur or be achieved). Statements concerning oil and gas reserves also may be deemed to be forward looking statements in that they reflect estimates based on certain assumptions that the resources involved can be economically exploited. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those, reflected in the statements. These risks include, but are not limited to: the risks of the oil and gas industry (for example, operational risks in  exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; risks and uncertainties involving geology of oil and gas deposits; the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to future production, costs and expenses; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; health, safety and environmental risks and risks related to weather such as hurricanes and other natural disasters); uncertainties as to the availability and cost of financing; fluctuations in oil and gas prices; risks associated with derivative positions; inability to realize expected value from acquisitions, inability of our management team to












	 








	execute its plans to meet its goals, shortages of drilling equipment, oil field personnel and services, unavailability of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities and the possibility that government policies may change or governmental approvals may be delayed or withheld. Additional information on these and other factors which could affect Contango’s operations or financial results are included in Contango’s other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from the projections in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on the estimates and opinions of management at the time the statements are made. Contango does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements should circumstances or management's estimates or opinions change. Initial production rates are subject to decline over time and should not be regarded as reflective of sustained production levels.
