Price, Market and Products.  I am more encouraged today after looking at the Conference slides than I was yesterday (if that is possible).   I found slides 143,156 & 157 particularly exciting.   156 & 157 show Price vs. Customer Expectation. Customer Expectation has never been achieved! PIC's offer this to happen. But in the mean time (2018 thru 2022) if I understand this, we will be selling at $7 $6 $5 ect. per gig. not a buck as they want, that is $700,$600,$500 per device! Big Bucks.  But much more exciting is slide 143. The Vast majority of the market in Ethernet TxRx PIC's IS and WILL be for a 100g PIC. I think this is a repeated slide. The 400 is just icing on the cake. Maybe the 400 takes over and the projection chart will not look the same next year, but, the risk here is getting less and less.   Gentlemen, we already have it! The 100g will start entering a huge market by the end of the year (priced the same as the currant 10g) and it's frikkin June already!   The end of the presentation touches on additional markets. Many many more devices to come. Did you notice OLED flexible screens is a new slide?   Thanks for the link, very much appreciated guys.   To infinity and beyond Buz ! Maybe there is a Great Pumpkin.

Bottom line there is not product here. It's just a hyped up story and always has been a hyped up story playing on investors get rich quick feelings.   How many production systems does this company have their product in testing and evaluation right now? NONE! They don't even have a third party tested device with commercially suited specifications. What don't you get?    The bigs have to test new technology for multiple years before going live in the real world. Long way to go, if ever, and I say never. Time for another letter from Mgmt to dangle the carrot.   #keepscamming  





Useful idiot is a term for people perceived as propagandists for a cause whose goals they are not fully aware of, and who are used cynically by the leaders of the cause.   GP BOOYAH TO DA MOON X INFINITY & BEYOND!

About








  






















 



About UsLightwave Logic has a rich and long history in developing polymer materials for photonic devices. Our materials are truly world class and are now being designed into high-performance photonic devices as part of a Photonics Integrated Circuit (PIC) platform. We are headquartered in Longmont, Colorado, and we have a second facility in Newark, Delaware. Electro-optic polymer materials are synthesized in Delaware to specifications driven by our technical device and PIC platform teams in Longmont. In Longmont, the polymer materials are fabricated into photonic devices as part of the PIC platform.As can be seen from our photonics product roadmap web page (in the technology section), Lightwave Logic is currently developing high-speed photonic ridge waveguide modulators as part of the PIC platform. Initial performance speeds are at 10 Gbps and 25 Gbps. At 25 Gbps we can design 4 channel optical sub-assemblies (4 x 25 Gbps) to enable the explosive and fast growing 100 Gbps market opportunity in fiber communications; especially for data centers and high-performance computing. Our roadmaps follow a route to extend our photonic device technology in ridge waveguide modulators to 50 Gbps, and enable the new and upcoming 400 Gbps opportunities that many data centers are designing architectures for. In order to reach this important data rate node in optical networking, we will be designing 8 channel optical sub-assemblies (8 x 50 Gbps).. With 50 Gbps polymer modulators we will be also designing PAM4 solutions so that 400 Gbps can be enabled with only 4 x 50 Gbps modulators as opposed to 8 (PAM4 is a protocol being used by the industry to minimize the number of photonic devices for a data rate and is based on electronic Pulse Amplitude Modulation coding of 4 digital levels. PAM4 is being implemented into a number of standards today). We are also exploring other modulator technologies.Our polymer based photonics devices include the following advantages:

Excellent scalability of the material, device, and platform
The versatility and ease of production of plastic (Polymers) in a fab
The ability to become part of an integrated photonics platform or PIC
Extreme miniaturization
Very high-speed performance that will enable 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps data rate opportunities
Excellent thermal stability
Material compatibility with Silicon and CMOS processes
Femtosecond optical response times
Ability to withstand a laser without bleaching out
Very high electro-optical activity
Lightwave Logic's vast array of unique chromophores offer all these advantages while enabling miniaturized device designs with low power and high efficiency. The uniqueness of the technology platform not only enables high-performance photonic devices but photonic devices that can be integrated onto a highly functional polymer PIC platform at 400 Gbps and beyond.Our technology platform using polymer materials, devices, and PICs have been protected by our company using patents and in other areas through trade secrets. We continue to file patents and develop trade secrets as we innovative with more advanced designs. At Lightwave Logic we believe that "Powered by the speed of light" is more than the company's branding statement; it is an advancement in the way of thinking for photonics and we intend to use our polymer technology platform to drive new opportunities in the marketplace.
