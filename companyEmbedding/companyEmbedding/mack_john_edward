Biography[edit]
Early career[edit]
Mack was born in New York City and graduated from the Horace Mann-Lincoln School in 1947. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Oberlin in 1951, and received his medical degree cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1955. He was a graduate of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute and was certified in child and adult psychoanalysis.
The dominant theme of his life's work has been the exploration of how one's perceptions of the world affect one's relationships. He addressed this issue of "world view" on the individual level in his early clinical explorations of dreams, nightmares and teen suicide, and in A Prince of Our Disorder, his biographical study of the life of British officer T. E. Lawrence, for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1977.[2]
Cold War and anti-nuclear activism[edit]
In the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the Cold War, including former President Jimmy Carter and the "father of the hydrogen bomb", Edward Teller. Together with luminaries such as Carl Sagan, Mack and other Physicians for Social Responsibility (the US affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War) promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the USSR. Emboldened by the organization's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the Nevada Test Site in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility.[3]
Alien abduction phenomenon[edit]
In the early 1990s, Mack commenced a decade-plus study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent alien encounter experiences. Such encounters had seen some limited attention from academic figures (R. Leo Sprinkle perhaps being the earliest, in the 1960s). Mack, however, remains probably the most esteemed academic to have studied the subject.
He initially suspected that such persons were suffering from mental illness, but when no obvious pathologies were present in the persons he interviewed, his interest was piqued. Following encouragement from longtime friend Thomas Kuhn, who predicted that the subject might be controversial, but urged Mack to collect data and ignore prevailing materialist, dualist and "either/or" analysis, Mack began concerted study and interviews. Many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world, including producing a heightened sense of spirituality and environmental concern.
Mack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go."[4] In a 1994 interview, Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed "inclined to take these [abduction] reports at face value". Mack replied by saying "Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't have a way to account for them."[5] Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, "I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [But] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry."[6]
Mack noted that there was a worldwide history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-industrial societies. One example is the vision quest common to some Native American cultures. Only fairly recently in Western culture, notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.
His interest in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people's alien encounters, and his suggestion that the experience of alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in nature—yet nonetheless real—set him apart from many of his contemporaries, such as Budd Hopkins, who advocated the physical reality of aliens.
His later research broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality, one which allows for experiences that may not fit the Western materialist paradigm, yet deeply affect people's lives. His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters (1999), was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern worldviews as it was the culmination of his work with the "experiencers" of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated.
Investigation[edit]
In May 1994, the Dean of Harvard Medical School, Daniel C. Tosteson, appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack's clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written of in Mack's 1994 book Abduction). In the same BBC article cited above, Angela Hind wrote, "It was the first time in Harvard's history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation." Mack described the investigation as "Kafkaesque": he never quite knew the status of the ongoing investigation, and the nature of his critics' complaints were not revealed to Mack until the committee had prepared a draft report eight months into the process. Because the committee was not a disciplinary committee, it was not governed by any established rules of procedure; the presentation of a defense was therefore difficult and costly for Mack.
The committee chairman was Arnold "Budd" Relman, M.D., a Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School who served as editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. According to Daniel Sheehan, one of Mack's attorneys, the committee's draft report suggested that "To communicate, in any way whatsoever, to a person who has reported a ‘close encounter’ with an extraterrestrial life form that this experience might well have been real...is professionally irresponsible.”[7]
Upon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack's defense, ten months into the process), questions arose from the academic community (including Harvard Professor of Law Alan Dershowitz) regarding the validity of an investigation of a tenured professor who was not suspected of ethics violations or professional misconduct. Concluding the fourteen-month investigation, Harvard then issued a statement stating that the Dean had "reaffirmed Dr. Mack's academic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment," concluding "Dr. Mack remains a member in good standing of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine." (Mack was censured in the committee's report for what they believed were methodological errors, but Dean Tosteson took no action based on the committee's assessment.) He had received legal help from Roderick MacLeish and Daniel P. Sheehan,[8] (of the Pentagon Papers case)[9] and the support of Laurance Rockefeller, who also funded Mack's non-profit organization for four consecutive years at $250,000 per year.[10]
Works[edit]
He wrote the following books:

Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters (1999)
Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens (1994)
A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T.E. Lawrence (1976)
Nightmares and Human Conflict (1970)


Collaborations:

The Alchemy of Survival: One Woman's Journey (1988)
Vivienne: The Life and Suicide of an Adolescent School Girl (1977)


He was editor or co-editor of:

Mind Before Matter: Vision of a New Science of Consciousness (2007; replaced by Paul Devereux)
Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference Held at M.I.T. Cambridge, MA (1995)
Human Feelings: Explorations in Affect Development and Meaning (1993)
Development and Sustenance of Self-Esteem in Childhood (1984)
Borderline States in Psychiatry - Seminars in Psychiatry (1975)


Unpublished:

When Worldviews Collide: A Paradigmatic Passion Play, a manuscript about the Harvard inquiry, was largely complete at the time of his death and is in-development as a motion picture.[11]
Elisabeth and Mark Before and After Death: The Power of a Field of Love,[12] described in Vanity Fair as an unpublished manuscript about Dr. Elisabeth Targ, in fact exists only as an outline and as hours of interview transcripts.


He also wrote the foreword to Paths Beyond Ego: The Transpersonal Vision (1993), the introductions to The PK Man: A True Story of Mind Over Matter (2000) by Jeffrey Mishlove and Secret Life (1992) by David M. Jacobs, and he contributed chapters to several books including The Long Darkness: Psychological and Moral Perspectives on Nuclear Winter (1986), The Psychology of Terrorism Vol. 1: A Public Understanding (2002), and The Psychospiritual Clinician's Handbook (2005).
Death[edit]
On Monday, September 27, 2004 while in London to lecture at a T. E. Lawrence Society-sponsored conference, Mack was killed by a drunken driver heading west on Totteridge Lane.[12] He was walking home alone, after a dinner with friends, when he was struck at 11:25 p.m. near the junction of Totteridge Lane and Longland Drive. He lost consciousness at the scene of the accident and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The driver was arrested at the scene, and later entered a plea of guilty by careless driving whilst under the influence of alcohol. Mack's family requested leniency for the suspect in a letter to the Wood Green Crown Court. "Although this was a tragic event for our family," the letter reads, "we feel [the accused's] behavior was neither malicious nor intentional, and we have no ill will toward him since we learned of the circumstances of the collision."[13]
Popular culture[edit]

He was illustrated by cartoonist Roz Chast in a four-page color strip, Aliens, Ahoy!, published in Duke University's DoubleTake magazine, Winter 1999 issue.[14]
He appears as a character in William Baer's book of poetry, The Unfortunates (1997).[14]
He was interviewed for the documentary film about the Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama Renaissance,[15] where he spoke about his conversations with the Dalai Lama about aliens,[16] but the interview was not included in the final edit of the film.
Life Story Rights secured in 2012 by MakeMagic Productions for feature film development.

Biography[edit]
Early career[edit]
Mack was born in New York City and graduated from the Horace Mann-Lincoln School in 1947. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Oberlin in 1951, and received his medical degree cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1955. He was a graduate of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute and was certified in child and adult psychoanalysis.
The dominant theme of his life's work has been the exploration of how one's perceptions of the world affect one's relationships. He addressed this issue of "world view" on the individual level in his early clinical explorations of dreams, nightmares and teen suicide, and in A Prince of Our Disorder, his biographical study of the life of British officer T. E. Lawrence, for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1977.[2]
Cold War and anti-nuclear activism[edit]
In the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the Cold War, including former President Jimmy Carter and the "father of the hydrogen bomb", Edward Teller. Together with luminaries such as Carl Sagan, Mack and other Physicians for Social Responsibility (the US affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War) promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the USSR. Emboldened by the organization's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the Nevada Test Site in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility.[3]
Alien abduction phenomenon[edit]
In the early 1990s, Mack commenced a decade-plus study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent alien encounter experiences. Such encounters had seen some limited attention from academic figures (R. Leo Sprinkle perhaps being the earliest, in the 1960s). Mack, however, remains probably the most esteemed academic to have studied the subject.
He initially suspected that such persons were suffering from mental illness, but when no obvious pathologies were present in the persons he interviewed, his interest was piqued. Following encouragement from longtime friend Thomas Kuhn, who predicted that the subject might be controversial, but urged Mack to collect data and ignore prevailing materialist, dualist and "either/or" analysis, Mack began concerted study and interviews. Many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world, including producing a heightened sense of spirituality and environmental concern.
Mack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go."[4] In a 1994 interview, Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed "inclined to take these [abduction] reports at face value".

[But] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry."[6]
Mack noted that there was a worldwide history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-industrial societies. One example is the vision quest common to some Native American cultures. Only fairly recently in Western culture, notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.
His interest in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people's alien encounters, and his suggestion that the experience of alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in nature—yet nonetheless real—set him apart from many of his contemporaries, such as Budd Hopkins, who advocated the physical reality of aliens.
His later research broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality, one which allows for experiences that may not fit the Western materialist paradigm, yet deeply affect people's lives. His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters (1999), was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern worldviews as it was the culmination of his work with the "experiencers" of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated.
Investigation[edit]
In May 1994, the Dean of Harvard Medical School, Daniel C. Tosteson, appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack's clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written of in Mack's 1994 book Abduction). In the same BBC article cited above, Angela Hind wrote, "It was the first time in Harvard's history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation." Mack described the investigation as "Kafkaesque": he never quite knew the status of the ongoing investigation, and the nature of his critics' complaints were not revealed to Mack until the committee had prepared a draft report eight months into the process. Because the committee was not a disciplinary committee, it was not governed by any established rules of procedure; the presentation of a defense was therefore difficult and costly for Mack.
The committee chairman was Arnold "Budd" Relman, M.D., a Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School who served as editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.

Biography[edit]
Early career[edit]
Mack was born in New York City and graduated from the Horace Mann-Lincoln School in 1947. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Oberlin in 1951, and received his medical degree cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1955. He was a graduate of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute and was certified in child and adult psychoanalysis.
The dominant theme of his life's work has been the exploration of how one's perceptions of the world affect one's relationships. He addressed this issue of "world view" on the individual level in his early clinical explorations of dreams, nightmares and teen suicide, and in A Prince of Our Disorder, his biographical study of the life of British officer T. E. Lawrence, for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1977.[2]
Cold War and anti-nuclear activism[edit]
In the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the Cold War, including former President Jimmy Carter and the "father of the hydrogen bomb", Edward Teller. Together with luminaries such as Carl Sagan, Mack and other Physicians for Social Responsibility (the US affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War) promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the USSR. Emboldened by the organization's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the Nevada Test Site in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility.[3]
Alien abduction phenomenon[edit]
In the early 1990s, Mack commenced a decade-plus study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent alien encounter experiences. Such encounters had seen some limited attention from academic figures (R. Leo Sprinkle perhaps being the earliest, in the 1960s). Mack, however, remains probably the most esteemed academic to have studied the subject.
He initially suspected that such persons were suffering from mental illness, but when no obvious pathologies were present in the persons he interviewed, his interest was piqued. Following encouragement from longtime friend Thomas Kuhn, who predicted that the subject might be controversial, but urged Mack to collect data and ignore prevailing materialist, dualist and "either/or" analysis, Mack began concerted study and interviews. Many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world, including producing a heightened sense of spirituality and environmental concern.
Mack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go."[4] In a 1994 interview, Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed "inclined to take these [abduction] reports at face value". Mack replied by saying "Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't have a way to account for them."[5] Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, "I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [But] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry."[6]
Mack noted that there was a worldwide history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-industrial societies. One example is the vision quest common to some Native American cultures. Only fairly recently in Western culture, notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.
His interest in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people's alien encounters, and his suggestion that the experience of alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in nature—yet nonetheless real—set him apart from many of his contemporaries, such as Budd Hopkins, who advocated the physical reality of aliens.
His later research broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality, one which allows for experiences that may not fit the Western materialist paradigm, yet deeply affect people's lives. His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters (1999), was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern worldviews as it was the culmination of his work with the "experiencers" of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated.
Investigation[edit]
In May 1994, the Dean of Harvard Medical School, Daniel C. Tosteson, appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack's clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written of in Mack's 1994 book Abduction). In the same BBC article cited above, Angela Hind wrote, "It was the first time in Harvard's history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation." Mack described the investigation as "Kafkaesque": he never quite knew the status of the ongoing investigation, and the nature of his critics' complaints were not revealed to Mack until the committee had prepared a draft report eight months into the process. Because the committee was not a disciplinary committee, it was not governed by any established rules of procedure; the presentation of a defense was therefore difficult and costly for Mack.
The committee chairman was Arnold "Budd" Relman, M.D., a Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School who served as editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. According to Daniel Sheehan, one of Mack's attorneys, the committee's draft report suggested that "To communicate, in any way whatsoever, to a person who has reported a ‘close encounter’ with an extraterrestrial life form that this experience might well have been real...is professionally irresponsible.”[7]
Upon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack's defense, ten months into the process), questions arose from the academic community (including Harvard Professor of Law Alan Dershowitz) regarding the validity of an investigation of a tenured professor who was not suspected of ethics violations or professional misconduct. Concluding the fourteen-month investigation, Harvard then issued a statement stating that the Dean had "reaffirmed Dr. Mack's academic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment," concluding "Dr. Mack remains a member in good standing of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine." (Mack was censured in the committee's report for what they believed were methodological errors, but Dean Tosteson took no action based on the committee's assessment.) He had received legal help from Roderick MacLeish and Daniel P. Sheehan,[8] (of the Pentagon Papers case)[9] and the support of Laurance Rockefeller, who also funded Mack's non-profit organization for four consecutive years at $250,000 per year.[10]
Works[edit]
He wrote the following books:

Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters (1999)
Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens (1994)
A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T.E. Lawrence (1976)
Nightmares and Human Conflict (1970)


Collaborations:

The Alchemy of Survival: One Woman's Journey (1988)
Vivienne: The Life and Suicide of an Adolescent School Girl (1977)


He was editor or co-editor of:

Mind Before Matter: Vision of a New Science of Consciousness (2007; replaced by Paul Devereux)
Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference Held at M.I.T. Cambridge, MA (1995)
Human Feelings: Explorations in Affect Development and Meaning (1993)
Development and Sustenance of Self-Esteem in Childhood (1984)
Borderline States in Psychiatry - Seminars in Psychiatry (1975)


Unpublished:

When Worldviews Collide: A Paradigmatic Passion Play, a manuscript about the Harvard inquiry, was largely complete at the time of his death and is in-development as a motion picture.[11]
Elisabeth and Mark Before and After Death: The Power of a Field of Love,[12] described in Vanity Fair as an unpublished manuscript about Dr. Elisabeth Targ, in fact exists only as an outline and as hours of interview transcripts.


He also wrote the foreword to Paths Beyond Ego: The Transpersonal Vision (1993), the introductions to The PK Man: A True Story of Mind Over Matter (2000) by Jeffrey Mishlove and Secret Life (1992) by David M. Jacobs, and he contributed chapters to several books including The Long Darkness: Psychological and Moral Perspectives on Nuclear Winter (1986), The Psychology of Terrorism Vol. 1: A Public Understanding (2002), and The Psychospiritual Clinician's Handbook (2005).
Death[edit]
On Monday, September 27, 2004 while in London to lecture at a T. E. Lawrence Society-sponsored conference, Mack was killed by a drunken driver heading west on Totteridge Lane.[12] He was walking home alone, after a dinner with friends, when he was struck at 11:25 p.m. near the junction of Totteridge Lane and Longland Drive. He lost consciousness at the scene of the accident and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The driver was arrested at the scene, and later entered a plea of guilty by careless driving whilst under the influence of alcohol. Mack's family requested leniency for the suspect in a letter to the Wood Green Crown Court. "Although this was a tragic event for our family," the letter reads, "we feel [the accused's] behavior was neither malicious nor intentional, and we have no ill will toward him since we learned of the circumstances of the collision."[13]
Popular culture[edit]

He was illustrated by cartoonist Roz Chast in a four-page color strip, Aliens, Ahoy!, published in Duke University's DoubleTake magazine, Winter 1999 issue.[14]
He appears as a character in William Baer's book of poetry, The Unfortunates (1997).[14]
He was interviewed for the documentary film about the Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama Renaissance,[15] where he spoke about his conversations with the Dalai Lama about aliens,[16] but the interview was not included in the final edit of the film.
Life Story Rights secured in 2012 by MakeMagic Productions for feature film development.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Mack John Edward carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Mack John Edward



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Mack John Edward



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Mack John Edward



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

John Edward Mack


Obituary
Condolences




























JOHN MACK John Edward Mack, 66 years, born November 9, 1944, died July 6, 2011 in Melbourne, FL, following a courageous battle with lung cancer. An outstanding, three sport athlete at North Penn Senior High School ('62), he received a scholarship (baseball) to La Salle University in Philadelphia, graduating in 1966. He later earned an MBA from Fordham University in New York City. Subsequent to a career in the medical devices industry, he taught at Montgomery County Community and Ursinus Colleges and recently retired to Florida. During the Vietnam Era he served in the Air National Guard. John grew up in North Wales and was a long time resident of the North Penn area. John enjoyed photography, horseshoes, working with and teaching computers, and baseball. He coached the Nor-Gwyn American Legion team from the fall of 1994 through the 1996 season and especially enjoyed working with pitchers. He was a fan of North Penn area local sports and an avid Philadelphia Phillies fan. He is survived by his brother James Mack of Lancaster, and his sister, Patricia Mack of Jacksonville, FL. He is also survived by four nephews, Joshua Redgrave, John Mack, James Mack and Alexander Beshel, beloved cousins, aunts and uncles. John was predeceased by his daughter, Joanna Maria, his parents, John Edward Mack, Sr. and Natalie Mack Schulze of North Wales and his sister, Mary Redgrave. Services will be private. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations to the Moffitt Cancer Center, John Mack Memorial, 12902 Magnolia Drive, UTC-Foundation, Tampa, FL 33612, would be appreciated.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Biography of John E. Mack, M.D.





John Mack hiking in 1998 (photograph courtesy of the family of Dr. Mack).



John Edward Mack, M.D. (Oct 4, 1929 – Sep 27, 2004) was a Pulitzer  Prize-winning biographer and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard  Medical School.
He won the Pulitzer Prize in  Biography in 1977 for A Prince of Our Disorder, his biography of T.  E. Lawrence, a British officer stationed in the Middle East who became  known as “Lawrence of Arabia”.
Dr Mack embraced a worldview inspired by  elements of spiritual and philosophical traditions which hold that we  are all connected to one another.
The theme of “connection” to  other life was explored most boldly in his study of men and women who  reported that recurrent “alien encounter” experiences had affected the  way they regarded the world, including a heightened sense of  spirituality and environmental concern. Mack’s interest in the  transformational aspects of these extraordinary experiences, and his  suggestion that the experience may be more transcendent than physical in  nature – yet nonetheless real – was largely reported in the media as a  simple endorsement of the reality of alien encounters.
Earlier in his career, he explored how this sense of “connection” developed between  different cultures, interviewing political leaders and citizens of the  then-Soviet Union and Israel/Palestine in the study of ethno-national  conflict and the nuclear arms race.
In the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the Cold War, including former President Jimmy Carter and the “father of the hydrogen bomb”, Edward Teller. Together with luminaries such as Carl Sagan, Mack and other Physicians for Social Responsibility (the US affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War) promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the USSR. Emboldened by the organization’s receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the Nevada Test Site in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility.
Dr Mack suggested that a  materialist worldview was the root cause of long-simmering conflicts  between the West and other cultures, and was responsible for the global  ecological crisis. A shift in perspective was required, he suggested, to  restore people’s appreciation of connections to one another and to the  natural world.
Mack’s final published book, Passport to the  Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters (1999), was as much a  philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern  worldviews as it was the culmination of his work with “experiencers” of  alien encounters.
Dr Mack’s credentials provided him with some  measure of protection from critics: He received his medical degree from  the Harvard Medical School (Cum Laude, 1955) after undergraduate study  at Oberlin (Phi Beta Kappa, 1951);  a graduate of the Boston  Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, and Board certified in child and  adult psychoanalysis. He founded the department of psychiatry of the Cambridge Hospital, the teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.
Nonetheless, in 1994, the Dean of Harvard Medical  School appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack’s clinical care and  clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien  encounters with him. Because the committee was not a disciplinary committee it was not governed by any established rules of procedure; the presentation of a defense was therefore difficult and costly for Mack.
Upon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack’s defense, ten months into the process), questions arose from the academic community (including Harvard’s own Professor of Law  Alan Dershowitz) about the validity of an open-ended investigation of a fulltime professor who was not subject to any claim of ethics violation  or professional misconduct. After fourteen months of inquiry, Harvard issued a statement stating that the  Dean had “reaffirmed Dr. Mack’s academic freedom to study what he wishes  and to state his opinions without impediment,” concluding “Dr. Mack  remains a member in good standing of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine.”
Dr Mack was born in New York City, and died in London at age 74.

John E. Mack naît le 4 Octobre 1929. Il fait ses  études à Oberlin (Phi Beta Kappa, 1951). En 1955, il obtient son diplôme  médical de l’Ecole Médicale de Harvard Medical (Cum Laude). Il est  diplômé de la Société et Institut Psychoanalytique de Boston et est  certifié en psychoanalyse pour enfant et adulte. Mack fonde l’unité d’enseignement psychiatrique au Cambridge Hospital de Harvard Medical School.
Le thème dominant du travail de sa vie  est l’exploration de comment les perceptions du monde de quelqu’un  affectent ses relations. Il traite cette question de la “vision du  monde” au niveau individuel dans ses premières explorations cliniques  sur les rêves, cauchemars et suicide des jeunes, et dans son étude  biographique de la vie de l’officier britannique T. E. Lawrence  (“Lawrence d’Arabie”), pour laquelle il reçoit le Prix Pulitzer en  biographie en 1977.
Mack pense que la culture occidentale a  besoin de s’éloigner d’une vision du monde purement matérialiste (qu’il  considère responsable de la Guerre Froide, la crise économique globale,  l’ethnonationalisme et les conflits régionaux) au profit d’une vision  du monde transpersonnelle embrassant certains élements des traditions  spirituelles et philosophiques orientales.
L’intérêt de Mack pour l’aspect spirituel de l’expérience humaine est comparée par le New York Times à celle du William James (qui fut également à Harvard) qui, comme lui,  fut controversé pour ses efforts à relier spiritualité et psychiatrie.
C’est dans ce même élan que Mack  devient encore plus controversé au début des années 1990s. Il entâme une  étude de plus de 10 ans sur 200 hommes et femmes déclarant que des  expériences de rencontre extraterrestre ont affecté leur vision du  monde, accroissant notamment leur sens de la spiritualité et leur  préoccupation de l’environment. L’intérêt de Mack pour les aspects  spirituels ou transformationnels des rencontres extraterrestres des  gens, ainsi que sa suggestion que l’experience d’un contact  extraterrestre puisse être de nature plus spirituel que physique — bien  que néanmoins réelle — le placent à part de nombre de ses contemporains  comme Budd Hopkins, qui défend la réalité physique des extraterrestres.  Selon Mack :
Les enlèvements s’apparentent à  une expérience psychologique et spirituelle qui se produit et trouve  peut-être son origine dans une autre dimension. Ce sont donc des  phénomènes qui nous ouvrent, ou du moins nous obligent à être ouverts à  des réalités qui n’appartiennent pas uniquement à notre monde physique.
Irrité par l’orientation des travaux  de Mack et estimant qu’il a failli aux normes d’investigation de  l’université, le doyen d’Harvard demande en 1994 à un comité d’éthique  d’évaluer la validité de ses recherches. En 1996, le comité admit que  Mack n’avait pas violé les règles déontologiques de la profession.  L’avocat de Mack précise que ce dernier ne croit pas nécessairement aux  extraterrestres venus de l’espace, mais qu’il ne croit pas non plus à la  thèse de la maladie mentale de ses patients.
John Mack est mort à Londres sur 27 Septembre 2004.

Biografia de John E. Mack, M.D. (Português)
John Edward Mack (4 de Outubro de 1929 – 27 de Setembro de 2004), foi um biógrafo galardoado com o Prémio Pulitzer e professor de Psiquiatria na Harvard Medical School.
Recebeu o Prémio Pulitzer na categoria de biografia em 1977 pela obra A Prince of Our Disorder, sobre a vida de E.T. Lawrence, um oficial britânico estacionado no Médio Oriente, mais conhecido por “Lawrence da Arábia”.
Mack adoptou uma visão do mundo inspirada por elementos de tradições espirituais e filosóficas que defendem que todos nós estamos interligados.
A questão da “ligação” a outras formas de vida foi corajosamente explorada no seu estudo de indivíduos de ambos os sexos que afirmavam que repetidas experiências de “encontros com extraterrestres” tinham influenciado o modo como encaram o mundo, incluindo um acentuado sentido de espiritualidade e de preocupação ambiental. O interesse de Mack pelos aspectos transformacionais destas extraordinárias experiências, bem como a sua sugestão de que a experiência poderá ser de natureza mais transcendental do que física – mas, não obstante, real – foi largamente divulgado pelos meios de comunicação como uma simples aceitação da realidade de encontros com extraterrestres.
Num período anterior da sua carreira Mack tinha explorado como este sentido de “ligação” se desenvolvia entre culturas diferentes, ao entrevistar líderes políticos e cidadãos da então União Soviética, de Israel e da Palestina no estudo de conflitos étnico-nacionais e da corrida ao armamento nuclear.
Nos anos 80, como parte da sua investigação sobre as causas profundas da Guerra Fria, Mack entrevistou várias figuras políticas internacionais, incluindo o antigo presidente norte-americano Jimmy Carter e Edward Teller, o “pai da bomba de hidrogénio”. Juntamente com figuras brilhantes como Carl Sagan, Mack e outros membros da Physicians for Social Responsibility (Médicos para a Responsabilidade Social), organização norte-americana afiliada na International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (Médicos Internacionais para a Prevenção da Guerra Nuclear), promoveram a eliminação das armas nucleares e um fim para o conflito latente entre os Estados Unidos e a União Soviética. Encorajados pelo Prémio Nobel da Paz que a organização recebeu em 1985, John E. Mack e Carl Sagan em conjunto com outros 700 académicos, marcharam nos terrenos das instalações do Centro de Ensaios Nucleares de Nevada no Verão de 1986, estabelecendo um recorde de desobediência civil para aquele local de testes de armas nucleares.
Mack sugeriu que a visão materialista do mundo estava na origem dos conflitos há muito latentes entre o Ocidente e outras culturas, e era responsável pela crise ecológica à escala global. Segundo ele, era necessária uma mudança de perspectiva para restabelecer a nossa apreciação pelas ligações com os outros e com a natureza.
O seu último livro Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters, publicado em 1999 foi, simultaneamente, um tratado filosófico estabelecendo a ligação entre os temas da espiritualidade e das modernas visões do mundo, e o culminar do seu trabalho com “experienciadores” de encontros com extraterrestres.
As qualificações de Mack ofereceram-lhe um certo grau de protecção em relação aos críticos: formou-se em Medicina (Cum Laude) na Harvard Medical School em 1955, após estudos no Oberlin College (Phi Beta Kappa, 1951); efectuou estudos de pós-graduação no Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute; foi certificado em Psicanálise Infantil e do Adulto. John E. Mack fundou o departamento de Psiquiatria do Cambridge Hospital, o hospital universitário da Harvard Medical School.
Todavia, em 1994 o reitor da Harvard Medical School nomeou um comité para examinar, confidencialmente, os cuidados clínicos e a investigação clínica de Mack nos indivíduos que com ele partilharam os seus encontros com extraterrestres. Não sendo este comité um comité disciplinar, não estava regulado por quaisquer regras de procedimento estabelecidas. A apresentação de uma defesa foi portanto difícil e dispendiosa para Mack.
Ao ser revelada publicamente a existência do comité (a revelação pública ocorreu inadvertidamente dez meses após o início do processo, aquando da convocação de testemunhas para a defesa de Mack), surgiram questões por parte da comunidade académica (incluindo um Professor de Direito em Harvard, Alan Dershowitz) sobre a legitimidade de uma investigação por tempo indeterminado a um professor que não era acusado de qualquer violação de conduta ética ou de normas deontológicas da profissão. Após catorze meses de inquérito, Harvard emitiu uma declaração anunciando que o reitor “reiterou a liberdade académica do Dr. Mack para estudar o que deseja e para expor as suas opiniões sem entraves”, concluindo que “o Dr. Mack continua a ser um membro de boa reputação na Faculdade de Medicina de Harvard”.
John E. Mack nasceu em Nova Iorque e faleceu em Londres, com 74 anos de idade.

Plagiarism[edit]
Several sections of this page are plagiarized from Mack's page here: http://www.johnemackinstitute.org/center/center_news.asp?id=227 Penguinwithin (talk) 22:26, 7 May 2008 (UTC)

As that page now displays a copy of the Wikipedia article (notably so), this concern seems not (or at least no longer) applicable. __meco (talk) 11:01, 1 November 2008 (UTC)

Connection is a scientific reality[edit]

Mack had a world view inspired by elements of spiritual and philosophical traditions which hold that people are all connected to one another

That "people are all connected to one another" is the dominant scientific theory referred to as the universal common ancestor. Neil deGrasse Tyson famously said, "We are all connected: to each other biologically, to the Earth chemically, to the rest of the universe atomically." We know that "all life on Earth evolved from a single-celled organism that lived roughly 3.5 billion years ago" and that we are all connected at the most basic atomic level on up, from the air we breathe to the food we eat, to the technology we share and interact with on a daily level. This has less to do with a "world view inspired" by spirituality and philosophical traditions, and more to do with observable evidence about the universe. Viriditas (talk) 06:13, 25 November 2012 (UTC)
Viriditas, That may be true, but in this context Mack's belief in "connection" is based on the Eastern influences present in the field of Transpersonal Psychology, since Dr. Mack was a psychiatrist, not a biologist or a chemist. Perhaps an interlink to Transpersonal Psychology could be worked into the paragraph. 06:36, 27 December 2012 (UTC) — Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.218.159.177 (talk)

Investigation[edit]

"According to Daniel Sheehan, Mack's attorney, the committee's draft report…"

This addition is problematic and I am not sure how best to resolve it. Although the sentence begins with the conditional statement "According to", the next hundred words of Sheehan's excessively-long quote give the impression of being direct quotes from the ad hoc committee's draft report, but they are simply Sheehan's interpretation of that report (or his interpretation of the beliefs of the authors of that report). Relying upon only one person's perspective for such a large section (it is a full third of the Investigation section) does not conform to best practices, so I will trim back Sheehan's remarks a bit and I will advise finding a second and third source to convey more info about the report. A secondary minor problem associated with this addition is that Sheehan is introduced as Mack's attorney before the next paragraph which more properly introduced Eric MacLeish and Daniel Sheehan as Mack's attorneys. Willbueche (talk) 23:47, 6 April 2017 (UTC)
Update: I made Sheehan's quote more succinct, but, it is still problematic because it is partly false. Sheehan said they demanded Mack use "every possible available battery of standard psychological tests which might conceivably explain the report as the product of some known form of clinical psychosis", but in fact the report emphasized that absent any evidence of mental illness, Mack should have considered non-pathological psychological explanations. Sheehan's claim they expected Mack would find "clinical psychosis" is hyperbole. I checked the report myself to see what they wrote. Again this is the problem with using one person as a source.Willbueche (talk) 02:09, 7 April 2017 (UTC)
