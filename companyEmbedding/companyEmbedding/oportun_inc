Background

Context – The Need for Responsible Small Dollar Credit
If you are one of the 45 million people in the US who has little-or-no credit history, your options are limited if you need to borrow money to fix your car, pay the security deposit on a new rental apartment, or get through a medical emergency.
People with scant credit history are considered “unscoreable” by the three major credit bureaus. That means some of the options many of us rely on for unexpected expenses – like credit cards – simply aren’t an option for them. Unfortunately, most mainstream financial institutions haven’t figured out how to evaluate the risk profile or likelihood of repayment of someone who lacks a credit score – or how to make serving such a population profitable enough to warrant the effort.
Sometimes the only option available to individuals with limited credit history is to turn to payday, auto-title, or pawn loans. Some of these alternatives may have high rates or unrealistic payment terms. Because many of these alternatives do not report customer accounts to credit bureaus, these loans do not necessarily help individuals establish the credit history and score they need.
The Company
Oportun is a financial technology company founded in 2005 with the mission of providing affordable loans to US Latinos and others with little or no credit history, so they can establish credit and build a better future.
Oportun uses advanced data analytics and technology to score the “unscorable” and offer responsible, affordable, credit-building loans to individuals with limited credit history. Oportun operates more than 230 retail locations and delivers bilingual (English/Spanish) customer service via retail locations, contact centers, and mobile to customers in Arizona, California, Illinois, Missouri, Nevada, Texas, and Utah.
In recognition of Oportun’s goals of increasing economic opportunity for its clients, promoting community development, and serving low-income or underserved communities, Oportun is certified by the United States Department of Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution or CDFI.
Oportun is headquartered in Redwood City, CA.
Oportun’s approach to lending
Oportun loans range from $300 “starter” loans to $8,000* for returning customers.

Oportun loans are responsible: Our proprietary system – which leverages advanced data analytics and ten years of insights gained from serving customers – determines every loan applicant’s ability to repay and approves loans to those it calculates are likely to repay on time. Our underwriting also includes verifying income for all loan applicants.
Payment terms are realistic: We use our data analytics to determine loan amounts and terms that fit individual budgets. Our loans feature fixed, affordable payments over 7 to 35 months. There are no “surprise” balloon payments. There is no penalty for pre-payment. Payments align to customer pay periods.
Our loans are affordable: Compared to the alternatives typically available to people with limited credit history — including payday, auto-title, and pawn loans — Oportun loans are affordable. Those alternatives are on average more than three times more expensive than Oportun loans but can be up to seven times more expensive, according to a study conducted in California, Texas, and Illinois on Oportun’s behalf by the Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI), a leading authority on consumer financial health.**
We help customers establish credit history: Customer accounts are reported to credit bureaus to help borrowers establish credit history.

Impact
We are proud of the impact we’ve had since our first loan in 2006.
Our 1.9 million loans (and counting), prove that small dollar credit can be provided in a more responsible, ethical, and scalable way.
We’ve helped nearly 930,000 customers, the vast majority of whom live in low-to-moderate income communities, by disbursing more than $3.5 billion in loans (as of March 31, 2017).
Our customers have saved an estimated $920 million in interest and fees by borrowing money from us instead of choosing other alternatives typically available to people with limited credit history in Arizona, California, Illinois, Nevada, Texas, and Utah. (This is according to the previously mentioned research study commissioned by Oportun and conducted by CFSI.)
Expert Opinions
Oportun highlighted as a responsible and affordable alternative:

Oportun featured in its top tier list of responsible alternatives. Stopping the Payday Loan Trap: Alternatives that Work, Ones that Don’t (2010) by the National Consumer Law Center, a national non-profit advocate for consumer justice and economic security for low-income and disadvantaged communities.
Oportun mentioned as “..an example of a mission-driven lender committed to affordably and responsibly reaching underserved communities,” Encouraging Responsible Credit for Financially Vulnerable Consumers (2014), by the Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization.
Quote: “Affordable alternatives also exist in the non-bank market – including the regulated consumer finance model employed in Texas by Oportun/Progreso Financiero.” Reshaping the Future of Small-Dollar Lending in Texas: Alternatives to High-Cost Payday and Auto Title Loans(2012), by the Texas Appleseed Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization promoting justice for underserved Texans.

Customer Testimonials
We asked our customers to share what the funds have enabled them to do in their lives. The response was overwhelming – following are a few of the more than 4,000 entries we received from our customers. (Please note that we did not independently verify their testimonials or their use of loan proceeds.)
“[Oportun] has been a huge support for me and my family. The first loan I obtained was for $500, which was a great help and allowed me to pay for the immigration interview for my parents. It had been over ten years since I’d seen them, and it was very difficult to get the money together for the necessary immigration transactions and all of the costs. The second loan I got was for $1,500, this was like a gift from God because with this sum I was able to bring my folks to the United States after their visa application was approved. I hadn’t seen them for over ten years and thanks to this money it became possible to bring them to me. Thanks…”
– N.A., Bakersfield, CA
“I used this loan to process the adoption of a little girl who had been taken from her parents for their neglect. She has been living with us for 2 ½ [years] and this August the process will be finalized. We are very proud to be parents and to be able to provide love and care to a little child who is not responsible for the errors of the parents who abandoned her.” 
-N.V., Los Angeles, CA
“[Oportun] has changed the life of my two children, my wife and myself, a humble servant.First Loan–$500: I bought a set of 4 chairs.
Second Loan–$500: I bought a cot for my kids.
Third Loan–$500: I bought a bed; after four years, my wife and I were able to sleep in a bed.
-J. J.B., Santa Ana, CA
With the earlier loan I was able to pay the costs for the burial of my father. I didn’t have good credit at that time, but they believed in me. Today I have a better credit rating, I am becoming better disciplined and more responsible, and will clear up my credit. Yesterday, July 21, 2014, they made me a second loan, which I will use to fix my car. Thank you for existing, [Oportun].
-F.R., Cicero, IL
*Loan approval and terms may vary per applicant. $8,000 loans are for returning customers upon approved credit.
**Oportun: The True Cost of a Loan – CFSI developed a product cost model that took into account the size of a loan, the monthly cash-flow borrowers have available to service a loan, and the rates and terms offered at Oportun and at alternative small-dollar credit providers that are generally used to fulfill similar borrowing needs in the geographic areas served by Oportun (Arizona, California, Illinois, Nevada, Texas, and Utah). Data was collected in December 2016.

What it means to be a CDFI

Oportun, formerly Progreso Financiero, is a Community Development Financial Institution
Oportun, formerly Progreso, was certified by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2009 as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI).

Community Development Financial Institutions – or CDFIs – are mission-driven financial institutions that are dedicated to providing financial services to meet the needs of economically disadvantaged individuals within underserved communities.
CDFIs invest in local communities and the residents who live there by providing critically needed financing often unavailable from mainstream financial institutions.
CDFIs are certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund – known as the CDFI Fund. In order to become a certified CDFI, the financial institution must: have a primary mission of promoting community development; provide financial products and services; serve one or more defined low-income target markets; maintain accountability to the community it serves; and be a legal non-governmental entity.
All CDFIs share a common mission of serving low-income communities. CDFIs are commonly loan funds, credit unions, community banks, or venture capital funds.
Certified CDFIs are part of a national network promoting economic growth in America’s underserved communities by financing businesses, creating jobs, and rebuilding neighborhoods.
As a CDFI, Oportun puts the community first and values local economic growth.

Business Profile














BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Oportun, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 13 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Get the loan you deserve




Payments that fit your budget
Our loans feature fixed, affordable payments over 7 to 35 months. No changes to your payment amounts or hidden fees. You can make your regular payments or pay more—there is no penalty for pre-payment.





No credit history required
At Oportun, we look beyond limited credit history to understand your true financial potential. You could qualify for a loan with little or no credit history. And you don’t need to provide collateral, such as a car title or post-dated check.




Build a better financial future
We reward returning customers who repay their loans on time with the potential to borrow more over time, at a lower APR. Plus, by reporting customer accounts to the credit bureaus, our loan can help you establish your credit history.




Exclusively designed for you
 Our very supportive and welcoming customer experience is designed with you in mind. We offer bilingual (English/Spanish) servicing at convenient hours where you live and work.See our locations >>

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/01/2016
            

                BBB has determined that Oportun, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by:

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines:

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Oportun, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 13 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Get the loan you deserve




Payments that fit your budget
Our loans feature fixed, affordable payments over 7 to 35 months. No changes to your payment amounts or hidden fees. You can make your regular payments or pay more—there is no penalty for pre-payment.





No credit history required
At Oportun, we look beyond limited credit history to understand your true financial potential. You could qualify for a loan with little or no credit history. And you don’t need to provide collateral, such as a car title or post-dated check.




Build a better financial future
We reward returning customers who repay their loans on time with the potential to borrow more over time, at a lower APR. Plus, by reporting customer accounts to the credit bureaus, our loan can help you establish your credit history.




Exclusively designed for you
 Our very supportive and welcoming customer experience is designed with you in mind. We offer bilingual (English/Spanish) servicing at convenient hours where you live and work.See our locations >>
