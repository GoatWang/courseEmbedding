History[edit]
Sierra Wireless was founded in 1993 in Vancouver, Canada. In August 2003, it completed an acquisition of privately held, high-speed CDMA wireless modules supplier, AirPrime,[6] issuing approximately 3.7 million shares to AirPrime shareholders.[7] On March 6, 2007, the company announced its purchase of Hayward, California-based AirLink Communications, a privately held developer of high-value fixed, portable, and mobile wireless data solutions.[8] Prior to the May 2007 completion of its sale to Sierra Wireless for a total of $27 million in cash and stock, AirLink had reported $24.8 million in revenues and gross margin of 44 percent.[9]
On August 5, 2008, Sierra Wireless announced its purchase of the assets of Junxion, a Seattle based producer of Linux-based mobile wireless access points and network routers for enterprise and government customers. Terms of the acquisition were not made public.[10]
In December 2008, Sierra Wireless made a friendly all-cash bid to acquire Wavecom, a French M2M wireless technology developer. The sale was completed for $275 million.[11]
On August 1, 2012, the company announced it had completed its acquisition of SAGEMCOM's M2M business in a cash transaction of EUR44.9 million plus assumed liabilities.[12]
In November 2012, Sierra Wireless was recognized as an M2M market leader by market research and intelligence firm, ABI Research. Based on the company's aggregated revenues, ABI found that Sierra Wireless held a 34 percent share of the M2M module market.[13]
On January 28, 2013, it was announced that Sierra Wireless had entered a definitive agreement to sell all assets and operations related to its AirCard business to NETGEAR, Inc. for $138 million in cash plus approximately $6.5 million in assumed liabilities as of December 31, 2012.[14]
Patents and technology[edit]
Sierra Wireless has been granted more than 550 unique patents for an array of technologies ranging from built-in antennas and product form factors, to battery power usage and management and network efficiency improvements. The company currently has patents pending in the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, Mexico, and South Africa.[15]
Products[edit]
Sierra Wireless offers products and solutions in four primary areas:[16]

AirLink, wireless gateways used in industrial, enterprise, and automotive applications. AirLink intelligent gateways and routers use embedded intelligence and the ALEOS Application Framework to support remote management, control, and configuration, and application services for vertical market solutions.
AirPrime, embedded modules providing cellular connectivity for wireless mobile computing and M2M often used by device manufacturers to bring new 2G - 4G, GSM, and CDMA devices to market via PCI Express MiniCards, surface-mount modules, modem-only functionality, and programmable devices.
AirVantage, a cloud-based application facilitating M2M service delivery consisting of the AirVantage Management Service M2M device management application, and AirVantage Enterprise Platform for collecting, sharing, and integration of machine data using API standards, as well as development and deployment of M2M applications.
SAGEMCOM GSM-R terminals, wireless devices used in railway communications and applications.

Until the 2013 sale of all assets and operations,[14] Sierra Wireless also manufactured and marketed AirCard, mobile broadband devices permitting users to connect notebooks, netbooks, and other electronics to the Internet over 3G and 4G mobile broadband networks via PC or express card slots, USB ports, or mobile WiFi hotspots.
Community support[edit]
Sierra Wireless is an active United Way of the Lower Mainland supporter. For its efforts, the company was recognized with United Way Employee Gold Awards and a 2002 Award of Excellence.[17]
In 2003, Canadian public university Simon Fraser University announced the creation of the Sierra Wireless Chair in Wireless Communication,[18] which was funded through annual donations for a three-year period. Upon completion of the original three-year term, the company extended its partnership with the university by establishing an endowed Sierra Wireless Professorship in Mobile Communication.[19] In partnership with the university's School of Engineering Science in the Faculty of Applied Sciences, the Sierra Wireless Mobile Communications Laboratory was opened in November 2012.[20]

History[edit]
Sierra Wireless was founded in 1993 in Vancouver, Canada. In August 2003, it completed an acquisition of privately held, high-speed CDMA wireless modules supplier, AirPrime,[6] issuing approximately 3.7 million shares to AirPrime shareholders.[7] On March 6, 2007, the company announced its purchase of Hayward, California-based AirLink Communications, a privately held developer of high-value fixed, portable, and mobile wireless data solutions.[8] Prior to the May 2007 completion of its sale to Sierra Wireless for a total of $27 million in cash and stock, AirLink had reported $24.8 million in revenues and gross margin of 44 percent.[9]
On August 5, 2008, Sierra Wireless announced its purchase of the assets of Junxion, a Seattle based producer of Linux-based mobile wireless access points and network routers for enterprise and government customers. Terms of the acquisition were not made public.[10]
In December 2008, Sierra Wireless made a friendly all-cash bid to acquire Wavecom, a French M2M wireless technology developer. The sale was completed for $275 million.[11]
On August 1, 2012, the company announced it had completed its acquisition of SAGEMCOM's M2M business in a cash transaction of EUR44.9 million plus assumed liabilities.[12]
In November 2012, Sierra Wireless was recognized as an M2M market leader by market research and intelligence firm, ABI Research. Based on the company's aggregated revenues, ABI found that Sierra Wireless held a 34 percent share of the M2M module market.[13]
On January 28, 2013, it was announced that Sierra Wireless had entered a definitive agreement to sell all assets and operations related to its AirCard business to NETGEAR, Inc. for $138 million in cash plus approximately $6.5 million in assumed liabilities as of December 31, 2012.[14]
Patents and technology[edit]
Sierra Wireless has been granted more than 550 unique patents for an array of technologies ranging from built-in antennas and product form factors, to battery power usage and management and network efficiency improvements. The company currently has patents pending in the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, Mexico, and South Africa.[15]
Products[edit]
Sierra Wireless offers products and solutions in four primary areas:[16]

AirLink, wireless gateways used in industrial, enterprise, and automotive applications. AirLink intelligent gateways and routers use embedded intelligence and the ALEOS Application Framework to support remote management, control, and configuration, and application services for vertical market solutions.
AirPrime, embedded modules providing cellular connectivity for wireless mobile computing and M2M often used by device manufacturers to bring new 2G - 4G, GSM, and CDMA devices to market via PCI Express MiniCards, surface-mount modules, modem-only functionality, and programmable devices.
AirVantage, a cloud-based application facilitating M2M service delivery consisting of the AirVantage Management Service M2M device management application, and AirVantage Enterprise Platform for collecting, sharing, and integration of machine data using API standards, as well as development and deployment of M2M applications.
SAGEMCOM GSM-R terminals, wireless devices used in railway communications and applications.

Until the 2013 sale of all assets and operations,[14] Sierra Wireless also manufactured and marketed AirCard, mobile broadband devices permitting users to connect notebooks, netbooks, and other electronics to the Internet over 3G and 4G mobile broadband networks via PC or express card slots, USB ports, or mobile WiFi hotspots.
Community support[edit]
Sierra Wireless is an active United Way of the Lower Mainland supporter. For its efforts, the company was recognized with United Way Employee Gold Awards and a 2002 Award of Excellence.[17]
In 2003, Canadian public university Simon Fraser University announced the creation of the Sierra Wireless Chair in Wireless Communication,[18] which was funded through annual donations for a three-year period. Upon completion of the original three-year term, the company extended its partnership with the university by establishing an endowed Sierra Wireless Professorship in Mobile Communication.[19] In partnership with the university's School of Engineering Science in the Faculty of Applied Sciences, the Sierra Wireless Mobile Communications Laboratory was opened in November 2012.[20]

Sierra Wireless Appoints Marc Overton as Senior Vice President & General Manager, Cloud & Connectivity Services
Jul 19 17
Sierra Wireless announced that Marc Overton has been appointed Senior Vice President & General Manager of the Cloud & Connectivity Services Business Unit, effective immediately.

Sierra Wireless Inc Announces Dual-Mode LPWAModule with Integrated - Application Processing and GNSS
Jun 28 17
Sierra Wireless announced the Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) cellular modules. The AirPrime(R) WP77 smart wireless modules simplify LPWA deployments for customers developing products that need to connect to multiple networks where different LPWA technologies are supported. The WP77 supports both LTE-M (Cat-M1) and NB-IoT (Cat-NB1) with optional 2G fallback, allowing customers to deploy the same device with multiple network operators worldwide. For those deploying in regions where 4G LTE coverage is not as widely available, 2G fallback ensures their devices stay connected to the network. With the commercialization of LTE-M and NB-IoT LPWA technologies, cellular is now a superior option for many IoT applications that were previously restricted to short-range technologies due to cost and battery life. LPWA technologies combine lower cost, broader coverage and better battery life with globally available and secure cellular networks and will connect millions more things to the Internet. The AirPrime WP77 is fully compliant with the 3GPP Release 13 standard and compatible with other devices in the WP family, retaining the same footprint, form factor, application framework and Linux distribution. Sierra Wireless AirPrime HL and WP Series modules are the smallest embedded modules (22 x 23 mm) to be completely interchangeable across 2G, 3G, 4G and LPWA technologies. They use the CF3(TM) form factor, which is footprint compatible across product lines, providing customers with the option to develop smarter by building their connected IoT product or service on a single module. WP77 modules are sampling with lead customers, with general availability in early 2018.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Sierra Wireless, Inc. Continues to Rebound as OEM Demand Improves
The Internet of Things pure play is flirting with a fresh 52-week high after posting strong first-quarter results.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            May 5, 2017 at 6:47PM
            
            





Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ:SWIR) announced strong first-quarter 2017 results Thursday after the market closed, easily beating expectations with growth in all segments. The Internet of Things specialist also offered better-than-expected forward guidance, and shares closed up nearly 15% on Friday as the market celebrated the news.
Let's take a closer look, then, at what drove Sierra Wireless' outperformance as it kicked off the new year, as well as what investors can expect from the company going forward.

Data source: Sierra Wireless.
What happened with Sierra Wireless this quarter?

Adjusted net income -- which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation and acquisition costs -- was $7.7 million, or $0.24 per share, up from $2.6 million, or $0.08 per share in the same year-ago period.
Both the top and bottom lines exceeded Sierra Wireless' guidance for revenue of $152 million to $161 million, and adjusted net income per share of $0.13 to $0.20.

By segment:

OEM Solutions revenue climbed 10% year over year, to $133 million, driven by improved demand from established OEM customers and programs across multiple segments, including automotive, energy, networking, payment, and mobile computing.
Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 44.8%, to $21.7 million, driven by revenue from new products, investments, and improved go-to-market capabilities, as well as last year's acquisition of GenX Mobile.
Cloud and connectivity revenue increased 2.1% -- 4.4% at constant currency -- to $7.1 million, with strong new customer acquisition and a growing pipeline in digital signage, asset tracking, payment, and retail markets.

In addition:

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) grew 85.1%, to $12.4 million.
Acquired the assets of GlobalTop Technology's Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) business for $3.2 million. GNSS products generated roughly $5 million in revenue over the past year and roughly broke even on the bottom line. GNSS materially expands Sierra Wireless' cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth module portfolio aimed at key markets like asset tracking, telematics, drones, and automotive.
Repurchased $2.8 million in shares during the quarter.
Ended the year with cash and equivalents of $92.5 million, down from $102.8 million last quarter.






What management had to say
Sierra Wireless CEO Jason Cohenour stated:

In the first quarter of 2017, we delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth and profitability results that exceeded our expectations. We continued to strengthen our position as a leader in device-to-cloud solutions for the Internet of Things with new customer wins, new product offerings and the acquisition of the assets of GlobalTop Technology's GNSS business.

Looking forward
For the second quarter, Sierra Wireless expects revenue of $165 million to $175 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.24 to $0.32. These ranges include a full quarter's contribution from the newly acquired GNSS business. But even excluding that incremental revenue, Sierra Wireless' guidance would have easily topped investors' expectations for second-quarter earnings of $0.16 per share and revenue of $155.9 million. 
In short, this was another exceptional quarter from Sierra Wireless as it solidifies its central role enabling the burgeoning Internet of Things trend. So with its shares up nearly 60% year to date before today's pop, but still trading well below their 2015 highs, Sierra Wireless has plenty of room to continue climbing from here.

     There are many challenges when updating drivers. Finding the correct driver for all the devices in your Windows computer can be a hassle and installation can sometimes be tedious at best.
     You simply want your hardware to work and with the best performance!

History[edit]
Sierra Wireless was founded in 1993 in Vancouver, Canada. In August 2003, it completed an acquisition of privately held, high-speed CDMA wireless modules supplier, AirPrime,[6] issuing approximately 3.7 million shares to AirPrime shareholders.[7] On March 6, 2007, the company announced its purchase of Hayward, California-based AirLink Communications, a privately held developer of high-value fixed, portable, and mobile wireless data solutions.[8] Prior to the May 2007 completion of its sale to Sierra Wireless for a total of $27 million in cash and stock, AirLink had reported $24.8 million in revenues and gross margin of 44 percent.[9]
On August 5, 2008, Sierra Wireless announced its purchase of the assets of Junxion, a Seattle based producer of Linux-based mobile wireless access points and network routers for enterprise and government customers. Terms of the acquisition were not made public.[10]
In December 2008, Sierra Wireless made a friendly all-cash bid to acquire Wavecom, a French M2M wireless technology developer. The sale was completed for $275 million.[11]
On August 1, 2012, the company announced it had completed its acquisition of SAGEMCOM's M2M business in a cash transaction of EUR44.9 million plus assumed liabilities.[12]
In November 2012, Sierra Wireless was recognized as an M2M market leader by market research and intelligence firm, ABI Research. Based on the company's aggregated revenues, ABI found that Sierra Wireless held a 34 percent share of the M2M module market.[13]
On January 28, 2013, it was announced that Sierra Wireless had entered a definitive agreement to sell all assets and operations related to its AirCard business to NETGEAR, Inc. for $138 million in cash plus approximately $6.5 million in assumed liabilities as of December 31, 2012.[14]
Patents and technology[edit]
Sierra Wireless has been granted more than 550 unique patents for an array of technologies ranging from built-in antennas and product form factors, to battery power usage and management and network efficiency improvements. The company currently has patents pending in the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, Mexico, and South Africa.[15]
Products[edit]
Sierra Wireless offers products and solutions in four primary areas:[16]

AirLink, wireless gateways used in industrial, enterprise, and automotive applications. AirLink intelligent gateways and routers use embedded intelligence and the ALEOS Application Framework to support remote management, control, and configuration, and application services for vertical market solutions.
AirPrime, embedded modules providing cellular connectivity for wireless mobile computing and M2M often used by device manufacturers to bring new 2G - 4G, GSM, and CDMA devices to market via PCI Express MiniCards, surface-mount modules, modem-only functionality, and programmable devices.
AirVantage, a cloud-based application facilitating M2M service delivery consisting of the AirVantage Management Service M2M device management application, and AirVantage Enterprise Platform for collecting, sharing, and integration of machine data using API standards, as well as development and deployment of M2M applications.
SAGEMCOM GSM-R terminals, wireless devices used in railway communications and applications.

Until the 2013 sale of all assets and operations,[14] Sierra Wireless also manufactured and marketed AirCard, mobile broadband devices permitting users to connect notebooks, netbooks, and other electronics to the Internet over 3G and 4G mobile broadband networks via PC or express card slots, USB ports, or mobile WiFi hotspots.
Community support[edit]
Sierra Wireless is an active United Way of the Lower Mainland supporter. For its efforts, the company was recognized with United Way Employee Gold Awards and a 2002 Award of Excellence.[17]
In 2003, Canadian public university Simon Fraser University announced the creation of the Sierra Wireless Chair in Wireless Communication,[18] which was funded through annual donations for a three-year period. Upon completion of the original three-year term, the company extended its partnership with the university by establishing an endowed Sierra Wireless Professorship in Mobile Communication.[19] In partnership with the university's School of Engineering Science in the Faculty of Applied Sciences, the Sierra Wireless Mobile Communications Laboratory was opened in November 2012.[20]

In August 2003, it completed an acquisition of privately held, high-speed CDMA wireless modules supplier, AirPrime,[6] issuing approximately 3.7 million shares to AirPrime shareholders.[7] On March 6, 2007, the company announced its purchase of Hayward, California-based AirLink Communications, a privately held developer of high-value fixed, portable, and mobile wireless data solutions.[8] Prior to the May 2007 completion of its sale to Sierra Wireless for a total of $27 million in cash and stock, AirLink had reported $24.8 million in revenues and gross margin of 44 percent.[9]
On August 5, 2008, Sierra Wireless announced its purchase of the assets of Junxion, a Seattle based producer of Linux-based mobile wireless access points and network routers for enterprise and government customers. Terms of the acquisition were not made public.[10]
In December 2008, Sierra Wireless made a friendly all-cash bid to acquire Wavecom, a French M2M wireless technology developer. The sale was completed for $275 million.[11]
On August 1, 2012, the company announced it had completed its acquisition of SAGEMCOM's M2M business in a cash transaction of EUR44.9 million plus assumed liabilities.[12]
In November 2012, Sierra Wireless was recognized as an M2M market leader by market research and intelligence firm, ABI Research. Based on the company's aggregated revenues, ABI found that Sierra Wireless held a 34 percent share of the M2M module market.[13]
On January 28, 2013, it was announced that Sierra Wireless had entered a definitive agreement to sell all assets and operations related to its AirCard business to NETGEAR, Inc. for $138 million in cash plus approximately $6.5 million in assumed liabilities as of December 31, 2012.[14]
Patents and technology[edit]
Sierra Wireless has been granted more than 550 unique patents for an array of technologies ranging from built-in antennas and product form factors, to battery power usage and management and network efficiency improvements. The company currently has patents pending in the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, Mexico, and South Africa.[15]
Products[edit]
Sierra Wireless offers products and solutions in four primary areas:[16]

AirLink, wireless gateways used in industrial, enterprise, and automotive applications. AirLink intelligent gateways and routers use embedded intelligence and the ALEOS Application Framework to support remote management, control, and configuration, and application services for vertical market solutions.
AirPrime, embedded modules providing cellular connectivity for wireless mobile computing and M2M often used by device manufacturers to bring new 2G - 4G, GSM, and CDMA devices to market via PCI Express MiniCards, surface-mount modules, modem-only functionality, and programmable devices.
AirVantage, a cloud-based application facilitating M2M service delivery consisting of the AirVantage Management Service M2M device management application, and AirVantage Enterprise Platform for collecting, sharing, and integration of machine data using API standards, as well as development and deployment of M2M applications.
SAGEMCOM GSM-R terminals, wireless devices used in railway communications and applications.

Until the 2013 sale of all assets and operations,[14] Sierra Wireless also manufactured and marketed AirCard, mobile broadband devices permitting users to connect notebooks, netbooks, and other electronics to the Internet over 3G and 4G mobile broadband networks via PC or express card slots, USB ports, or mobile WiFi hotspots.
Community support[edit]
Sierra Wireless is an active United Way of the Lower Mainland supporter. For its efforts, the company was recognized with United Way Employee Gold Awards and a 2002 Award of Excellence.[17]
In 2003, Canadian public university Simon Fraser University announced the creation of the Sierra Wireless Chair in Wireless Communication,[18] which was funded through annual donations for a three-year period. Upon completion of the original three-year term, the company extended its partnership with the university by establishing an endowed Sierra Wireless Professorship in Mobile Communication.[19] In partnership with the university's School of Engineering Science in the Faculty of Applied Sciences, the Sierra Wireless Mobile Communications Laboratory was opened in November 2012.[20]

History[edit]
Sierra Wireless was founded in 1993 in Vancouver, Canada. In August 2003, it completed an acquisition of privately held, high-speed CDMA wireless modules supplier, AirPrime,[6] issuing approximately 3.7 million shares to AirPrime shareholders.[7] On March 6, 2007, the company announced its purchase of Hayward, California-based AirLink Communications, a privately held developer of high-value fixed, portable, and mobile wireless data solutions.[8] Prior to the May 2007 completion of its sale to Sierra Wireless for a total of $27 million in cash and stock, AirLink had reported $24.8 million in revenues and gross margin of 44 percent.[9]
On August 5, 2008, Sierra Wireless announced its purchase of the assets of Junxion, a Seattle based producer of Linux-based mobile wireless access points and network routers for enterprise and government customers. Terms of the acquisition were not made public.[10]
In December 2008, Sierra Wireless made a friendly all-cash bid to acquire Wavecom, a French M2M wireless technology developer. The sale was completed for $275 million.[11]
On August 1, 2012, the company announced it had completed its acquisition of SAGEMCOM's M2M business in a cash transaction of EUR44.9 million plus assumed liabilities.[12]
In November 2012, Sierra Wireless was recognized as an M2M market leader by market research and intelligence firm, ABI Research. Based on the company's aggregated revenues, ABI found that Sierra Wireless held a 34 percent share of the M2M module market.[13]
On January 28, 2013, it was announced that Sierra Wireless had entered a definitive agreement to sell all assets and operations related to its AirCard business to NETGEAR, Inc. for $138 million in cash plus approximately $6.5 million in assumed liabilities as of December 31, 2012.[14]
Patents and technology[edit]
Sierra Wireless has been granted more than 550 unique patents for an array of technologies ranging from built-in antennas and product form factors, to battery power usage and management and network efficiency improvements. The company currently has patents pending in the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, Mexico, and South Africa.[15]
Products[edit]
Sierra Wireless offers products and solutions in four primary areas:[16]

AirLink, wireless gateways used in industrial, enterprise, and automotive applications. AirLink intelligent gateways and routers use embedded intelligence and the ALEOS Application Framework to support remote management, control, and configuration, and application services for vertical market solutions.
AirPrime, embedded modules providing cellular connectivity for wireless mobile computing and M2M often used by device manufacturers to bring new 2G - 4G, GSM, and CDMA devices to market via PCI Express MiniCards, surface-mount modules, modem-only functionality, and programmable devices.
AirVantage, a cloud-based application facilitating M2M service delivery consisting of the AirVantage Management Service M2M device management application, and AirVantage Enterprise Platform for collecting, sharing, and integration of machine data using API standards, as well as development and deployment of M2M applications.
SAGEMCOM GSM-R terminals, wireless devices used in railway communications and applications.

Until the 2013 sale of all assets and operations,[14] Sierra Wireless also manufactured and marketed AirCard, mobile broadband devices permitting users to connect notebooks, netbooks, and other electronics to the Internet over 3G and 4G mobile broadband networks via PC or express card slots, USB ports, or mobile WiFi hotspots.
Community support[edit]
Sierra Wireless is an active United Way of the Lower Mainland supporter. For its efforts, the company was recognized with United Way Employee Gold Awards and a 2002 Award of Excellence.[17]
In 2003, Canadian public university Simon Fraser University announced the creation of the Sierra Wireless Chair in Wireless Communication,[18] which was funded through annual donations for a three-year period. Upon completion of the original three-year term, the company extended its partnership with the university by establishing an endowed Sierra Wireless Professorship in Mobile Communication.[19] In partnership with the university's School of Engineering Science in the Faculty of Applied Sciences, the Sierra Wireless Mobile Communications Laboratory was opened in November 2012.[20]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
