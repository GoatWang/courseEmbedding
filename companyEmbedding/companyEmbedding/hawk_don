About This Game
							Delta Force — Black Hawk Down: Team Sabre is the official expansion pack to the #1 best selling PC game in North America. Team Sabre was developed using the Delta Force — Black Hawk Down engine and it requires the mother product to run. 					The game is a military-based shooter but the missions are fictitious and not based on any actual real events.  The expansion follows the Team Sabre Squadron as they are deployed to take out targets and carry out mission objectives in two separate single player campaigns (*approximately 5 missions each) that take place in Columbia and Iran.  The multiplayer feature boasts 30 new maps and an enhanced level of mod support for players to build their own unique maps. 					The highlight of this expansion pack is that it features lush jungle terrain, never seen before to this extent in a Delta Force game.  This also adds an exciting element to gameplay in both the single and multiplayer game.					*features subject to change					Feature Breakdown 2 all new single player campaigns that take place in treacherous South American jungle terrain and across islands in the Persian Gulf.  New Weapons & Vehicles: Select from 24 weapons to achieve your mission objectives, including 3 new to the series, the H&K G3A3, H&K G36E and the H&K PSG1 Sniper Rifle. New modes of transport include the MH-53M PaveLow IV helicopter and the RHIB Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat.  Free unrivaled multiplayer mayhem — up to 64 players via NovaWorld and up to 50 players on a LAN (tbd).  30 new multiplayer maps.  Uses an enhanced version of the Delta Force — Black Hawk Down engine with mod-support features for building unique multiplayer battlefields.  A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Warrior Foundation

What if the item I want is not listed?
First be sure you are searching in the correct category.  You can also try searching for the item by it's name.  It is possible that we do not have the item in our system.  If you search for it and can't find it, we probably don't carry the game.
What if the item I want is out of stock?
We get new inventory in almost every day so check back often.  You can also request to be notified when we restock the item by clicking "Notify me when Restocked".

From the Dragon BHD Twin Pack, comes Delta operator Jeff!DRAGON--------------Black Hawk Down (JEFF)======================DBZ verdict: 7/10Jeff's pretty standard, if you've got LEO, you've got Jeff. Some may say, "WTF? you know what you're talking about???? Jeff has the ultra cool protec helmet that is different from the standard ones used by Navy Seals! Man, what a wanker!" No fret, it aint hard to do. Below is a pic of Jeff (with headsculpt changed over to LARRY, doesn't say much about Jeff's headsculpt I suppose).  Yeah, Jeff's got Leo's protect helmet (with ear protector flaps cutt off), throat mike, Eagle Assault Vest, black body armour, 3 coloured BDUs, two M16 pouches with two greandes, two canteens, one first aid pouch, Mk23 pistol and drop down pouch (as seen in LEO again), and black ranger boots. Nothing much exciting. But wait, he's got a very cool looking camo M14 (not in pitcure, sorry, will upload when ready).But man, wait, you think this is the best look delta operator you've seen? In my own opinion, nope! I need a better looking Delta operator, therefore I embarked on a journey to create one. Believe it or not, just one attempt, two hours intotal, some elastic traps, super glue, sewing kit, and a pair of scissors....taadaa  Don't know what you guys think but I'm very happy with it myself, though he doesn't wear a BDU at the moment, I'm sure he's gonna rock Jeff when he's fully equipped.Shitz! This turned out to be very little of a review of Jeff, more like showing off what I did. Bummer....DBZ out!HOTdbZ workshophttp://www.hotdbz.20m.com[email protected]

OK, I changed my mind. Jeff doesn't look as bad as what I first thought. He's going to get his body back. As promised, the picture of his camo M14. Sweet!  HOTdbZ workshophttp://www.hotdbz.20m.com[email protected]

Hey buddy,Did you get the two pack locally or ordered it in via airmail. If locally, which shop. I've been too busy at work this week to have a look in the shops. BTW, which shops in Melb do you get your figures from?&Is the M-14 camo rifle from the box or have you added your own camo. Reason I ask is that it looks different from the pics on DML site.ThanksJB

Everything you see is standard from the box, other than my own modifications. Actually, the figure was ordered from an online store. I just returned from Singapore after a 6 months break, therefore my tolerance for slow shipment is very low.HOTdbZ workshophttp://www.hotdbz.20m.com[email protected]

Cool!Thanks for the heads up!From the looks of it, the Protec is a straight side cut?Is it contoured around the ears?Plus the eagle vest, does it only hold MP-5 mags like Leo's?If th eProtec is a straight cut and the vest is leo's, it seems like there's no real point in getting the figure unless you're desperate for that cool M-14.

happygo, I really hate to say this but yes, there's nothing different from LEO as compared to JEFF. Jeff's got the "straight cut across" protec helmet, contours? Nope, just two small cut-ins to show the ears, but if you noticed the standard dragon protec helmets, there are holes to show the ears, so if you cut it straight across, you'll end up with still a small groove that shows the ears. Am I getting you confused?The Eagles Assault Vest, yes, it holds MP-5s instead of M4 mags. Stinks isn't it?Why can't dragon make one for Jeff that holds M4s mags? That's why I'm doing one up myself. I'll be attaching some loops on the left chest to hold shotgun shells. Now the only thing left would be for me to find out what shotgun they used in the mission.You got any clues?DBZ out!HOTdbZ workshophttp://www.hotdbz.20m.com[email protected]

No clues mate.That's just one of the reasons why I got rid of my Leo vest.I like BBI Elite Force Striker's vest because it seems to be in proportion and holds M-4 magazines.I've also got Owl's vest which is sweet.I'll also get rid of my Devgru Shane vest for the same reasons.If there's anyone still a fan of the mp-5, give me a shout.We'll work out a trade for my Shane vest.   [email protected] And that's a @#%$ shame about the protecs...a real let-down in my books.

G'day.The Jeff figure comes with a Mk 23 mod 0? I'm pretty sure USSOCOM didn't accept this pistol into service until 1996. I guess it doesn't really matter, but if Dragon are trying to be historically accurate, they've @#%$ up. James.

Game description







Delta Force — Black Hawk Down: Team Sabre is the official expansion pack to the #1 best selling PC game in North America. Team Sabre was developed using the Delta Force — Black Hawk Down engine and it requires the mother product to run.
The game is a military-based shooter but the missions are fictitious and not based on any actual real events. The expansion follows the Team Sabre Squadron as they are deployed to take out targets and carry out mission objectives in two separate single player campaigns (*approximately 5 missions each) that take place in Columbia and Iran. The multiplayer feature boasts 30 new maps and an enhanced level of mod support for players to build their own unique maps.
The highlight of this expansion pack is that it features lush jungle terrain, never seen before to this extent in a Delta Force game. This also adds an exciting element to gameplay in both the single and multiplayer game.

Features:
2 all new single player campaigns that take place in treacherous South American jungle terrain and across islands in the Persian Gulf. New Weapons & Vehicles: Select from 24 weapons to achieve your mission objectives, including 3 new to the series, the H&K G3A3, H&K G36E and the H&K PSG1 Sniper Rifle. New modes of transport include the MH-53M PaveLow IV helicopter and the RHIB Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat. Free unrivaled multiplayer mayhem — up to 64 players via NovaWorld and up to 50 players on a LAN (tbd). 30 new multiplayer maps. Uses an enhanced version of the Delta Force — Black Hawk Down engine with mod-support features for building unique multiplayer battlefields. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Warrior Foundation

Trades the more urban areas for the open landscapes of most previous series entries
Legolas_Katarn

01/23/2017





                    Team Sabre is an expansion to Delta Force Black Hawk Down that adds new levels, weapons, and vehicles. Levels have left the more urban areas of the original campaign for the more open areas that previous games were known for. The change in level design once again means that armed with a sniper rifle you can easily kill most enemies thanks to the, still, lacking AI. The new vehicles are never controllable instead being something to ride in or shoot out of. Not much is added to the single player game, another drawn at release might have been new content for the multiplayer but that isn't going to be as interesting this time around. The game has aged better than some of the previous titles but was still only an average game when it launched and is less now.
