About Brandes






Who We Are A Pioneer in Global Value Investing Driven by a singular goal to help investors pursue their long-term investment objectives, Brandes Investment Partners, L.P., (Brandes) has scoured the globe for attractively priced companies since the firm’s founding in 1974. A leading investment advisory firm specializing in managing a variety of global equity and fixed-income assets for investors worldwide, Brandes was among the first investment firms to invest globally using a value approach. We apply a long-term perspective to both investment strategies and management of our business, as outlined in the firm's 100-Year Vision . Focused on the Principles of Benjamin Graham  Brandes applies the value-investing discipline to security selection pioneered by Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. This approach seeks to identify and invest in companies that are selling at a discount to their estimated fundamental value, or true worth. Inspired by the Pursuit of Value-Driven Growth Potential Finding value for our clients inspires Brandes just as much today as it did when we started 40 years ago.  After navigating four decades of market ebbs and flows, we continue to believe true value investing is the only way to seek meaningful, long-term growth potential for our clients. Invested In Our Strategies – Alongside Our Clients  At Brandes, we have a long-established culture of investing alongside of our clients. Our Co-Investment Guidelines ensure that our leadership’s financial interests are aligned with those of our clients by requiring that all members of the firm’s various Investment Committees maintain meaningful personal investments in Brandes strategies, especially in those they co-manage.

Brandes Investment Partners & Co. is the Canadian affiliate of Brandes Investment Partners, L.P., of San Diego, California. This relationship provides Canadian institutional and high-net-worth investors with access to the entire firm’s considerable resources and expertise, supported by a 35-year track record.
About Brandes
Through our disciplined application of bottom-up, Graham & Dodd value principles, we strive to provide institutional and high-net-worth investors with returns in excess of the benchmark over the long term. While past performance is no guarantee, the approach we use has delivered competitive absolute and relative performance returns over longer periods of time.Our firm recognizes the importance of every one of our distinguished institutional and high-net-worth clients, and we strive to provide the highest level of products and service at all times.Brandes is defined and differentiated by three strong ”pillars”:
1. Committee Approach To Investment Decisions
2. Graham & Dodd Philosophy
3. Independence For The Firm
Committee Approach to Investment Decisions
Instead of individual fund managers, carefully chosen teams apply our disciplined process across all products. Clients benefit from the breadth and depth of knowledge of senior executives and investment professionals working together for a common goal, rather than competing for personal recognition. Specific procedures guard against “groupthink” and minimize vulnerability to personnel departures.
Graham & Dodd Philosophy
Our investment principles have remained unchanged since Charles Brandes founded the firm in 1974. A large team of research analysts scours the globe to identify companies that can be purchased at a discount to our estimate of their true, intrinsic value. The researchers’ findings are then presented to an investment committee for careful scrutiny and, ultimately, consensus on potential long-term outperformance. As Benjamin Graham stated, beating the benchmarks demands portfolios that look different than the benchmarks. Therefore, we are completely willing to bear little resemblance to the indices. As a consequence of our approach (rather than by design), our portfolios typically have conservative fundamental characteristics such as low price-to-earnings ratio, low price-to-book value, low price-to-cash flow, and higher than average dividend yield.
Independence for the firm
One-hundred-percent owned by senior Brandes personnel, we are free to focus solely on our clients’ best interests. Independence also enables us to make the kind of long-term decisions that have kept our firm debt-free, profitable, and well-resourced, particularly during turbulent economic environments. Our commitment to retaining key personnel ensures both a high level of staff expertise and the continuity and integrity of our process.

The principal regulator  in the Jurisdiction has received an application from the Filer on behalf of the  Initial Top Funds and such other mutual funds as may be managed by the Filer or  an affiliate or successor of the Filer from time to time with similar investment  objectives to the Initial Top Funds (the “Top  Funds” and individually, a “Top Fund”)  for a decision under the securities legislation of the Jurisdiction of the principal  regulator (the Legislation) for an exemption,  pursuant to section 19.1 of National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds (NI 81-102),  from:

ii.             the  prohibition contained in paragraph 2.5(2)(c) of NI 81-102 against a mutual fund  investing in another mutual fund’s securities where those securities are not qualified  for distribution in the local jurisdiction (together with paragraph (i) above, the Requested Relief)

to permit each Top Fund  to invest up to 10% of its net assets, taken at market value at the time of the  investment, in aggregate, in units of Galibier Canadian Equity Pool and Invesco  Select Emerging Markets Equity Pool (collectively, the Underlying Pooled Funds).

4.             The  Filer or an affiliate is, or will be, the manager of each Top Fund.

5.             Each  Top Fund is, or will be, a “mutual fund”, as such term is defined under the Securities Act (Ontario) (the Act), to which NI 81-102 applies.
6.             Each  Top Fund has, or will have, a simplified prospectus and annual information form  prepared in accordance with NI 81-101, and securities of each Top Fund are, or will  be, qualified for distribution in the Jurisdictions. 
7.             Each  Top Fund is, or will be, a reporting issuer under the securities legislation of  one or more Jurisdictions. 
8.             None  of the existing Top Funds is in default of securities legislation in any of the  Jurisdictions.

18.          The  Underlying Pooled Funds are not reporting issuers in any of the Jurisdictions.
19.          Units  of the Underlying Pooled Funds are available for purchase only by investors who  qualify to invest in the Underlying Pooled Funds pursuant to an exemption from the  prospectus requirement, such as those that meet the definition of an “accredited  investor” as set forth in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions and/or the Act, including by mutual funds managed  by the Filer.

21.          The  investment objective of Invesco Select Emerging Markets Equity Pool is to achieve  capital growth over the long term by investing substantially all of its assets in  equity securities of companies located in emerging market countries and frontier  markets.
22.          While  not subject to NI 81-102, as of the date of this decision, the investment strategies  and restrictions of the Underlying Pooled Funds are consistent with NI 81-102. The  Filer has compliance processes in place to ensure each Underlying Pooled Fund is  managed in accordance with NI 81-102, as if it were applicable. 
Investments in Galibier Canadian Equity Pool
23.          An  investment by the Top Funds in Galibier Canadian Equity Pool will be compatible  with the investment objectives and strategies of those Top Funds that desire exposure  to Canadian equities.
24.          The  Filer submits that the most economically-efficient and strategic way to obtain the  desired exposure to a Canadian equity mandate is to invest in a fund that is focused  exclusively on Canadian equities. Allowing the Top Funds to invest in units of Galibier  Canadian Equity Pool will also allow them to leverage the expertise, research and  investment style of the portfolio manager of Galibier Canadian Equity Pool.
25.          While  it may be possible for the Filer to gain exposure to Canadian equities by investing  in other mandates, the Filer believes it is in the best interests of the Top Funds  to have the ability to invest in Galibier Canadian Equity Pool. 
26.            The Filer has determined that passive exchange traded funds (ETFs) generally do a sub-optimal job in  replicating the returns of inefficient or specialized markets, particularly small  and mid-sized Canadian equities. Moreover, actively-managed ETFs are too costly  an option for the Top Funds and the Filer would need to dedicate additional resources  to select from many different ETFs in order to gain the same diversified exposure  in the Canadian market as it would obtain by investing in Galibier Canadian Equity  Pool.
27.          The  Initial Top Funds are unable to invest directly in the individual underlying securities  that Galibier Canadian Equity Pool is invested in as the investment objectives of  the Initial Top Funds limit them to primarily investing in other mutual funds.
Investments in Invesco Select Emerging  Markets Equity Pool
28.          An  investment by the Top Funds in Invesco Select Emerging Markets Equity Pool will  be compatible with the investment objectives and strategies of those Top Funds that  desire exposure to emerging market equities.
29.          The  Filer believes that an investment in Invesco Select Emerging Markets Equity Pool  will provide an efficient and cost effective way for the Top Funds to achieve diversification  and obtain exposure to the markets and asset classes in which Invesco Select Emerging  Markets Equity Pool invests. This is particularly important in emerging markets,  which may be less efficient due to legal, regulatory, trading exchanges and accounting  systems that are typically less advanced than those in developed markets. 
30.            While it may be possible for the Filer to gain exposure to emerging markets equity  securities by investing in other mandates, the Filer believes it is in the best  interests of the Top Funds to have the ability to invest in Invesco Select Emerging  Markets Equity Pool. 
31.          The  Filer has determined that passive ETFs generally do a sub-optimal job in replicating  the returns of inefficient or specialized markets. Moreover, actively-managed ETFs  are too costly an option for the Top Funds and the Filer would need to dedicate  additional resources to select from many different ETFs in order to gain the same  diversified exposure to emerging markets equity securities as it would obtain by  investing in Invesco Select Emerging Markets Equity Pool.
32.          The  Initial Top Funds are unable to invest directly in the individual underlying securities  that Invesco Select Emerging Markets Equity Pool is invested in as the investment  objectives of the Initial Top Funds limit them to primarily investing in other mutual  funds.
General
33.          Each  of the Pooled Fund Managers has experience complying with NI 81-102 in its role  as manager or sub-advisor of mutual funds subject to NI 81-102. 
34.          Each  of the Pooled Fund Managers has confirmed that its respective Underlying Pooled  Fund is managed substantially in compliance with NI 81-102, and an investment in  an Underlying Pooled Fund by the Top Funds will not expose the investors of the  Top Funds to any investment strategies or risks that they are not currently exposed  to by virtue of holding the Top Funds. 
35.          Each  of the Pooled Fund Managers has confirmed that its respective Underlying Pooled  Fund does not utilize leverage, does not short sell and generally complies with  the investment and derivative requirements set out in NI 81-102. Each of the Pooled  Fund Managers also confirmed that its respective Underlying Pooled Fund will comply  with the restrictions relating to illiquid assets (section 2.4 of NI 81-102) and  investments in other investment funds (section 2.5 of NI 81-102) for so long as  they are held by one of the Top Funds. 
36.          The  Filer has entered, or will enter, into a fund purchase agreement with each of the  Pooled Fund Managers with respect to the Top Funds, and such fund purchase agreements  contain, or will contain, provisions that enable the Filer to comply with the conditions  of the Requested Relief.
37.          The  Filer will monitor the portfolio holdings of the Underlying Pooled Funds on a monthly  basis to ensure compliance with NI 81-102. 
38.          Securities  of the Underlying Pooled Funds are valued and redeemable on the same dates as securities  of the Top Funds. Each Underlying Pooled Fund will not hold more than 10% of its  net asset value in illiquid assets (as defined in NI 81-102). The portfolio of each  Underlying Pooled Fund will consist primarily of publicly traded securities. 
39.          An  investment by a Top Fund in an Underlying Pooled Fund will be effected based on  an objective net asset value of the Underlying Pooled Fund, which is calculated  in accordance with Part 14 of National Instrument 81-106 Investment Fund Continuous Disclosure (NI 81-106).
40.          Any  investment by a Top Fund in an Underlying Pooled Fund would be made in accordance  with the investment objectives and strategies of the Top Fund.
41.          Each  Top Fund will invest no more than 10% of its net assets in the Underlying Pooled  Funds.
42.          The  Top Funds will otherwise comply fully with section 2.5 of NI 81-102 in their investments  in the Underlying Pooled Funds and will provide all applicable disclosure mandated  for mutual funds investing in other mutual funds.
43.          Where  applicable, a Top Fund’s investment in an Underlying Pooled Fund will be disclosed  to investors in such Top Fund’s quarterly portfolio holding reports, financial statements  and/or fund facts documents.
Decision
The principal regulator  is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the  principal regulator to make the decision.
The decision of the  principal regulator under the Legislation is that the Requested Relief is granted  provided that:

(a)           the  Underlying Pooled Fund complies with Parts 2, 4 and 6 of NI 81-102 and Part 14 of  NI 81-106 at the time of any investment by a Top Fund and for so long as it is held  by a Top Fund;
(b)           the  prospectus of the Top Funds discloses, or will disclose at the next renewal or amendment  thereto, that they may invest in the Underlying Pooled Funds; and
(c)           a  Top Fund will not invest in an Underlying Pooled Fund if, immediately after the  investment, more than 10% of its net assets, in aggregate, taken at market value  at the time of the investment, would consist of investments in the Underlying Pooled  Funds.

Headnote
National Policy 11-203 Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions -- relief from certain specified derivatives and custodial requirements to permit mutual funds to enter into swap transactions that are cleared through a clearing corporation -- relief required because of U.S. and European requirements to clear over-the-counter derivatives including swaps -- decision treats cleared swaps similar to other cleared derivatives -- National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds.
Applicable Legislative Provisions
National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds, ss. 2.7(1) and (4), 6.8(1), 19.1.
November 18, 2015
IN THE MATTER OF THE SECURITIES LEGISLATION OF ONTARIO (the Jurisdiction) AND IN THE MATTER OF THE PROCESS FOR EXEMPTIVE RELIEF APPLICATIONS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND IN THE MATTER OF BRANDES INVESTMENT PARTNERS & CO. (the Filer)
DECISION
Background
The principal regulator in the Jurisdiction has received an application from the Filer for a decision under the securities legislation of the Jurisdiction of the principal regulator (the Legislation), pursuant to section 19.1 of National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds (NI 81-102), exempting each Existing Bridgehouse Fund (as defined below) and all current and future mutual funds managed by the Filer that enter into Swaps (as defined below) in the future (each, a Future Bridgehouse Fund and, together with the Existing Bridgehouse Funds, each, a Bridgehouse Fund and, collectively, the Bridgehouse Funds):

(i) from the requirement in subsection 2.7(1) of NI 81-102 that a mutual fund must not purchase an option or a debt-like security or enter into a swap or a forward contract unless, at the time of the transaction, the option, debt-like security, swap or contract has a designated rating or the equivalent debt of the counterparty, or of a person or company that has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of the counterparty in respect of the option, debt-like security, swap or contract, has a designated rating;
(ii) from the limitation in subsection 2.7(4) of NI 81-102 that the mark-to-market value of the exposure of a mutual fund under its specified derivatives positions with any one counterparty other than an acceptable clearing corporation or a clearing corporation that settles transactions made on a futures exchange listed in Appendix A to NI 81-102 shall not exceed, for a period of 30 days or more, 10 percent of the net asset value of the mutual fund; and
(iii) from the requirement in subsection 6.1(1) of NI 81-102 to hold all portfolio assets of an investment fund under the custodianship of one custodian in order to permit each Bridgehouse Fund to deposit cash and other portfolio assets directly with a Futures Commission Merchant (as defined below) and indirectly with a Clearing Corporation (as defined below) as margin,

in each case, with respect to cleared Swaps (the Requested Relief).
Under the Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions (for a passport application):

(a) the Ontario Securities Commission is the principal regulator for this application; and
(b) the Filer has provided notice that subsection 4.7(1) of Multilateral Instrument 11-102 Passport System (MI 11-102) is intended to be relied upon in each of the other provinces and territories of Canada (the Other Jurisdictions and collectively with Ontario, the Jurisdictions).

Interpretation
Terms defined in NI 81-102, National Instrument 14-101 Definitions, and MI 11-102 have the same meaning if used in this decision, unless otherwise defined. Capitalized terms used in this decision have the following meanings:

CFTC means the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
Clearing Corporation means any clearing organization registered with the CFTC or central counterparty authorized by ESMA, as the case may be, that, in either case, is also permitted to operate in the Jurisdiction or the Other Jurisdiction, as the case may be, where the Bridgehouse Fund is located
Dodd-Frank Act means the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
EMIR means the European Market Infrastructure Regulation
ESMA means the European Securities and Markets Authority
European Economic Area means all of the European Union countries and also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway
Existing Bridgehouse Fund means each mutual fund managed by the Filer that is relying on the Previous Relief on the date of this decision
Futures Commission Merchant means any futures commission merchant that is registered with the CFTC and/or clearing member for purposes of EMIR, as applicable, and is a member of a Clearing Corporation
OTC means over-the-counter
Portfolio Advisor means each of the Filer, each affiliate of the Filer and each third party portfolio manager retained from time to time by the Filer as portfolio sub-advisor to manage all or a portion of the investment portfolio of one or more Bridgehouse Funds
Swaps means the swaps that are, or will become, subject to a clearing determination or a clearing obligation issued by the CFTC or ESMA, as the case may be, including fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, basis swaps, forward rate agreements in U.S. dollars, the Euro, Pounds Sterling or the Japanese Yen, overnight index swaps in U.S. dollars, the Euro and Pounds Sterling and untranched credit default swaps on certain North American indices (CDX.NA.IG and CDX.NA.HY) and European indices (iTraxx Europe, iTraxx Europe Crossover and iTraxx Europe HiVol) at various tenors
U.S. Person has the meaning attributed thereto by the CFTC

Representations
This decision is based on the following facts represented by the Filer:

The Filer and the Bridgehouse Funds
1. The Filer is, or will be, the investment fund manager of each Bridgehouse Fund. The Filer is registered as an investment fund manager, a portfolio manager, an exempt market dealer and a mutual fund dealer in each of the Provinces of Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador. The Filer is also registered as a portfolio manager and an exempt market dealer in all of the other Jurisdictions, as a mutual fund dealer in all of the other Jurisdictions except the Province of Québec and as an investment fund manager in the Province of Québec. The head office of the Filer is in Toronto, Ontario.
2. The Filer is, or will be, the portfolio manager to the Bridgehouse Funds. Either an affiliate of the Filer or a third party portfolio manager is, or will be, the portfolio sub-advisor to some or all of the Bridgehouse Funds.
3. Each Bridgehouse Fund is, or will be, a mutual fund created under the laws of the Province of Ontario and is, or will be, subject to the provisions of NI 81-102.
4. Neither the Filer nor the Bridgehouse Funds are in default of securities legislation in any Jurisdiction.
5. The securities of each Bridgehouse Fund are, or will be, qualified for distribution pursuant to a prospectus that was, or will be, prepared and filed in accordance with the securities legislation of the Jurisdictions. Accordingly, each Bridgehouse Fund is, or will be, a reporting issuer or the equivalent in each Jurisdiction.
The Previous Cleared Swaps Relief
6. In a decision document dated December 17, 2013, the Bridgehouse Funds were granted relief from the requirements in subsections 2.7(1), 2.7(4) and 6.1(1) to permit the Bridgehouse Funds to enter into cleared Swaps that are, or will be, subject to a clearing determination issued by the CFTC (the Previous Relief).
7. The Previous Relief, in accordance with its terms, terminates on December 17, 2015. Accordingly, the Filer is seeking the Requested Relief on substantially the same terms as the Previous Relief, except that the Requested Relief also permits the Bridgehouse Funds to enter into cleared Swaps that become subject to a clearing obligation under EMIR.
Cleared Swaps
8. The investment strategies of each Bridgehouse Fund permit, or will permit, the Bridgehouse Fund to enter into derivative transactions, including Swaps. Each Portfolio Advisor for the Existing Bridgehouse Funds considers Swaps to be an important investment tool that is available to it to manage each Bridgehouse Fund's portfolio.
9. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain OTC derivatives be cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant at a clearing organization recognized by the CFTC. Generally, where one party to a Swap is a U.S. Person, that Swap must be cleared.
10. EMIR also requires that certain OTC derivatives be cleared through a central counterparty authorized to provide clearing services for purposes of EMIR. Generally, where one party to a Swap is a financial counterparty or a non-financial counterparty whose OTC derivative trading activity exceeds a certain threshold, in each case established in a state that is a participant in the European Economic Area, that Swap will be required to be cleared. The first clearing directive has been issued in respect of certain interest rate swaps and will be phased-in based on the category of both parties to the trade.
11. In order to benefit from both the pricing benefits and reduced trading costs that a Portfolio Advisor may be able to achieve through its trade execution practices for its advised investment funds and other accounts and from the reduced costs associated with cleared OTC derivatives as compared to other OTC trades, the Filer wishes to have the Bridgehouse Funds enter into cleared Swaps.
12. In the absence of the Requested Relief, each Portfolio Advisor will need to structure the Swaps entered into by the Bridgehouse Funds so as to avoid the clearing requirements of the CFTC and under EMIR, as applicable. The Filer respectfully submits that this would not be in the best interests of the Bridgehouse Funds and their investors for a number of reasons, as set out below.
13. The Filer strongly believes that it is in the best interests of the Bridgehouse Funds and their investors to continue to be able to execute OTC derivatives with global counterparties, including U.S. and European swap dealers.
14. In its role as a fiduciary for the Bridgehouse Funds, the Filer has determined that central clearing represents the best choice for the investors in the Bridgehouse Funds to mitigate the legal, operational and back office risks faced by investors in the global swap markets.
15. Each Portfolio Advisor may use the same trade execution practices for all of its advised funds and other accounts, including the Bridgehouse Funds. An example of these trade execution practices is block trading, where large number of securities are purchased or sold or large derivative trades are entered into on behalf of a number of investment funds and other accounts advised by one Portfolio Advisor. These practices include the use of cleared Swaps. If the Bridgehouse Funds are unable to employ these trade execution practices, then each affected Portfolio Advisor will have to create separate trade execution practices only for the Bridgehouse Funds and will have to execute trades for the Bridgehouse Funds on a separate basis. This will increase the operational risk for the Bridgehouse Funds, as separate execution procedures will need to be established and followed only for the Bridgehouse Funds. In addition, the Bridgehouse Funds will no longer be able to enjoy the possible price benefits and reduction in trading costs that a Portfolio Advisor may be able to achieve through a common practice for its advised funds and other accounts. In the Filer's opinion, best execution and maximum certainty can best be achieved through common trade execution practices, which, in the case of OTC derivatives, involve the execution of Swaps on a cleared basis.
16. As a member of the G20 and a participant in the September 2009 commitment of G20 nations to improve transparency and mitigate risk in derivatives markets, Canada has expressly recognized the systemic benefits that clearing OTC derivatives offers to market participants, such as the Bridgehouse Funds. The Filer respectfully submits that the Bridgehouse Funds should be encouraged to comply with the robust clearing requirements established by the CFTC and under EMIR by granting them the Requested Relief.
17. The Requested Relief is analogous to the treatment currently afforded under NI 81-102 to other types of derivatives that are cleared, such as clearing corporation options, options on futures and standardized futures. This demonstrates that, from a policy perspective, the Requested Relief is consistent with the views of the Canadian securities authorities in respect of cleared derivative trades.
18. For the reasons provided above, the Filer submits that it would not be prejudicial to the public interest to grant the Requested Relief.

Decision
The principal regulator is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the principal regulator to make the decision.
The decision of the principal regulator under the Legislation is that the Requested Relief is granted provided that when any rules applicable to customer clearing of OTC derivatives enter into force, the Clearing Corporation is permitted to offer customer clearing of OTC derivatives in the Jurisdiction or the Other Jurisdiction, as the case may be, where the Bridgehouse Fund is located and provided further that, in respect of the deposit of cash and other portfolio assets as margin:

(a) in Canada,

(i) the Futures Commission Merchant is a member of a SRO that is a participating member of CIPF; and
(ii) the amount of margin deposited and maintained with the Futures Commission Merchant does not, when aggregated with the amount of margin already held by the Futures Commission Merchant, exceed 10 percent of the net asset value of the Bridgehouse Fund as at the time of deposit; and

(b) outside of Canada,

(i) the Futures Commission Merchant is a member of a Clearing Corporation and, as a result, is subject to a regulatory audit;
(ii) the Futures Commission Merchant has a net worth, determined from its most recent audited financial statements that have been made public or from other publicly available financial information, in excess of the equivalent of $50 million; and
(iii) the amount of margin deposited and maintained with the Futures Commission Merchant does not, when aggregated with the amount of margin already held by the Futures Commission Merchant, exceed 10 percent of the net asset value of the Bridgehouse Fund as at the time of deposit.


This decision will terminate on the coming into force of any revisions to the provisions of NI 81-102 that address the clearing of OTC derivatives.
