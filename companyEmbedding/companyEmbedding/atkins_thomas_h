Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Atkins, Thomas H, JD10516 Meeting StProspect, KY 40059(502) 584-9714AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Law Office Of Thomas H Patteson7210 Dixie HwyLouisville, KY 40258(502) 933-7667AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysBusinesses in related categories to AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED3. Sims, Stan Attorney5226 Bardstown RdLouisville, KY 40291(502) 792-9603Estate Planning AttorneysWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: Attorney Stan Sims turned his legal career toward focusing exclusively on elder law in 2000, after receiving a phone call from a frightened woman whose husband ha…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED4. Gibson Law OfficeBBB Rating: A+3339 Taylorsville RdLouisville, KY 40205(502) 339-0105Personal Injury Law AttorneysWebsiteDirectionsServicesMore InfoFrom Business: At Gibson Law Offices, located in Louisville, Kentucky, our practice areas include representation of clients with family law issues including divorce, personal in…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Weber & Rose PSCBBB Rating: A+471 W Main StLouisville, KY 40202(502) 589-2200AttorneysWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Hebel & Hornung PLLC6511 Glenridge Park PlLouisville, KY 40222(502) 429-9790Real Estate AttorneysAttorneysWebsiteDirectionsServicesMore InfoAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Hargadon Lenihan & HerringtonBBB Rating: A+713 W Main StLouisville, KY 40202(502) 583-9701Personal Injury Law AttorneysWebsiteDirectionsServicesMore InfoAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. Crosby Law OfficesBBB Rating: A+2303 Hurstbourne Village DrLouisville, KY 40299(502) 499-6360AttorneysReal Estate AttorneysWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Neumann Marilyn PSC115 E Main StCampbellsville, KY 42718(270) 789-0123AttorneysYP AdDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: 115 East Main Campbellsvlle KY 42718Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. Troutman Law Office8644 Aiken RdLouisville, KY 40245(877) 537-1652Accident & Property Damage AttorneysWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: Have you or a loved one been injured in an accident?

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
