We rally around the high school and youth sports teams, come together for holiday parades and enjoy many other functions throughout the year.
In addition to my work with the town, I also fundraise for cancer charities and work with the Gold Star Dads of America, which helps families who have lost a loved one in combat or have a family member who is currently on combat deployment. When I’m not at the office, I love spending time with my family. On weekends, my wife of 42 years and I get together with our six kids and 15 grandchildren for breakfast — our two dogs have to stay home, though!
Early in my career with Allstate, I helped a young, self-employed couple with their life insurance coverage decisions. When the unthinkable happened, the benefits of that policy allowed the young woman to continue their business and support their family. Knowing that family would be okay with the help of that life insurance policy is just one reason I love being an Allstate agent. At our agency, we specialize in home, life, auto and commercial insurance. What I’m really proud of is the service we provide customers and that we are able to help in their time of need. We also speak English and Spanish and can work with customers in whichever language they are most comfortable.

In this carefully-written and important landmark book, Terry L Johnson takes note of the revival in Calvinist thinking that is evident across a broad spectrum of the church. But, he notes, for Calvinism to continue to thrive, attention must begin to be paid to the ministry and worship that alone will sustain and perpetuate it. The new Calvinism must take seriously the liturgical reforms of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, not just the theological, if today’s dynamism is to endure. Calvin would not have approved of the separation of theology from worship. . . . Reformed theology determined Reformed worship; and conversely, Reformed worship was the nurturing womb from which Reformed piety and practice sprang. Theology, worship, and piety are inseparably linked, neither thriving without the supporting presence of the other. This is by no means a polemic against one or two forms of worship. Terry Johnson makes a strong historical and biblical case, so that whatever the readers preferred style of worship, this book will inform and challenge.
Terry Johnson was born and raised in the Los Angeles area. His home church was Baptist, his sport was baseball, and his favorite class was history. As an undergraduate at the University of Southern California, he continued to play baseball and study history. But he also began to grow spiritually and over time sense a call to the gospel ministry. This led to two years at Trinity College, Bristol, England (an Anglican theological college), two years at Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary, and ordination in the Presbyterian Church in America. After 5 years in Coral Gables, Florida as an assistant minister, Terry married the former Emily Billings, and within 6 months they moved to Savannah to take the call of the Independent Presbyterian Church, which they have served since 1987. Terry is the author/compiler of the Trinity Psalter and Leading in Worship, and author of The Case for Traditional Protestantism, Reformed Worship, and the trilogy, When Grace Comes Home, When Grace Transforms, and When Grace Comes Alive.
