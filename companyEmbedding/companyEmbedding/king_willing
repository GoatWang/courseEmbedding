Burger King cheeseburgers


When the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1955, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper. The company did not add another permanent hamburger to its menu until the introduction of the Big King sandwich in 1996 in response to McDonald's Big Mac sandwich. The company began experimenting with premium hamburgers, made from higher quality ingredients, in 1978 with the introduction of its Specialty Sandwich product line. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. However, it wasn't until 2002 when the company began to work on a premium burger in earnest. On the value side, Burger King first started offering sliders to its menu in the mid-1980s and offered them off and on for the next twenty years.
The company's first major chicken product, its Original Chicken Sandwich, was also part of the company's 1978 Specialty Sandwich line. BK Chicken Tenders made their debut in a menu revision and expansion in 1985 to address the absence of a chicken fingers product akin to McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The company began offering the first, nationally available grilled chicken sandwich product when it added the BK Broiler in the early 1990s. That sandwich would go on to be reformulated and renamed several times before settling on the current TenderGrill sandwich. The chain added a second chicken finger product with the introduction of its BK Chicken Fries product in the mid-2000s. BK Chicken fries would also be removed and re-added to its menu in response to ownership changes and customer demand.
The company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu was another addition that came in with the company's in a 1978 menu expansion. Initially a clone of McDonald's breakfast line, the company began to differentiate itself with the introduction of the Crosan'wich breakfast sandwich in 1982.

Burgers[edit]
Whopper[edit]
Main article: Whopper




A Whopper sandwich


The Whopper sandwich is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's. Introduced in 1957, it has undergone several reformulations including re-sizing and bread changes. The burger is one of the best known products in the fast food industry; it is so well known that Burger King bills itself as the Home of the Whopper in its advertising and signage. Additionally, the company uses the name in its high-end concept, the BK Whopper Bar. Due to its place in the marketplace, the Whopper has prompted Burger King's competitors, mainly McDonald's with at least six different products and Wendy's with its Big Classic, to try to develop similar products designed to compete with it.[1][2][3][4][5]
The company markets several variants of the burger, such as the Whopper Jr.,[6] as well as other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business, such as the teriyaki Whopper in Japan or the LTO Canadian Whopper.[7][8][9] With the company's expansion into India, the chain introduced two new variants on the Whopper while reintroducing the chicken version of the sandwich. To accommodate practitioners of Islam and Hinduism, who make up the majority of the Indian population, the chain has eliminated beef and pork from its menu. In their place, the chain is using a combination of chicken, vegetarian patties and mutton in place of beef.[10]
To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time offerings ("LTO") on the Whopper such as the Windows 7 Whopper in Japan as a product tie-in with Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system. The hamburger contained seven stacked beef patties and measured 5 in (13 cm) high, weighed almost 2.2 lb (1.00 kg), and had more than 1,000 kcal (4,200 kJ). It was originally planned to be available for only seven days starting on 22 October 2009.[11] Due to its success in selling 6,000 sandwiches within the first four days, Burger King decided to extend the promotion period an extra nine days, ending on 6 November.[11][12]
As the signature product of the company, it is often at the center of advertising promotions, product tie-ins, and even corporate practical jokes and hoaxes such as its 1998 April Fool's Day prank where Burger King took out a full page advertisement in several national publications, such as USA Today, promoting a new version of the sandwich called the "Left-Handed Whopper". The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180° to accommodate southpaws.[13] Some of the early twenty-first century advertising programs, particularly in Europe, have drawn criticism for cultural insensitivity or misogyny. One such example was The Texican Whopper, an LTO version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a lucha libre wrestler.[14] The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans. Additionally, the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape that appeared to be a Mexican flag, a violation of Mexican laws governing the usage of its national banner.[15] Additionally, as the signature product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product. Specifically, the name "Whopper" is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in all markets it is sold.[Notes 1]

Big King[edit]

The European version of the Big King sandwich


The Big King sandwich is one of the major hamburger products sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King, and has been part of its menu for more than twenty years. During its testing phase in 1996-1997, it was originally called the Double Supreme and was configured similarly to the McDonald's Big Mac—including a three piece roll.[16] It was later reformulated as a more standard double burger during the latter part of product testing in 1997. It was given its current name when the product was formally introduced in September 1997, but maintained the more conventional double cheeseburger format.[17] Its introduction capped a period of sales success for Burger King, where the company successfully took on its rival McDonald's.[18] The product was renamed King Supreme in 2001 when it was slightly reformulated as part of a menu restructuring during a period of corporate decline for the company in which its corporate parent, Diageo, was trying to sell the company.[17] When a TPG Capital-led team of investors took over the company in 2002, the new management team again restructured the menu, eliminating the King Supreme in favor of its new BK Stacker line of sandwiches. The sandwiches were part of a line of controversial sandwiches high in fat and calories which several groups protested.[19][20][21] A limited time offering (LTO) sandwich line known as BK Toppers accompanied the Stacker line briefly in 2012, including one sandwich known as the Deluxe topper — a virtual clone of the Big King in its formulation.[22] The Stacker and Topper lines were discontinued in the United States shortly after, and the Big King returned to said market in November 2013 as a permanent product after the company was again sold, this time to 3G Capital of Brazil.[23][24]
Despite being off the menu in the United States for several years, the product was still sold in several other countries under several names during the interim of its unavailability in the United States.[25][26] One such example sold by BK's European arm of the company is a larger version of the sandwich called the Big King XXL, based on the company's Whopper sandwich. The Big King XXL is part of a line of larger double cheeseburgers known as the BK XXL line; the XXL line was the center of controversy over product health standards and advertising in Spain when first introduced.[27] There is also a chicken variant of the sandwich in the United States and Canada.[28] To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time variants on the Big King.[29] Being one of the company's major offerings, the Big King sandwich is sometimes at the center of advertising promotions and product tie-ins.[30] Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 2]

Premium burgers[edit]
Main article: Burger King premium burgers




The Steakhouse XT sandwich


As far back as the 1970s, international fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.
The chain's first major attempt was part of their Specialty Sandwich line that was introduced in 1979 was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. After the failure of the Specialty Sandwich line, Burger King went on to introduce several other premium burgers made from a variety of meats. One major example introduced in 2002 was the BK Back Porch Griller sandwich line. The sandwich, introduced in May 2002 was a pronounced failure, and pulled in September of that year. The next product Burger King introduced was its Angus Steakburger which it began selling in 2004; it too had lack-luster sales due in part to the patty being par cooked. The sandwich was later reformulated as the Steakhouse Burger which used a thinner, flatter, fresh cooked patty. The Steakhouse Burger sandwich was eventually replaced with the Steakhouse XT/Angus XT burger, which used a new, thicker round patty among several other changes. This newer sandwich was made possible with the introduction of the company's new broiler systems which allowed varying cooking times and temperatures which in turn gave the company the ability to utilize fresh cooked, thicker patties in its sandwiches. Only variations of the sandwich that explicitly state "Angus" in the title are manufactured from meat from Angus cattle. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America.
Internationally, the chain has introduced several lines of premium sandwiches. In New Zealand, the chain first introduced the BK Crown Jewels line which was based upon the Whopper, TenderGrill, and TenderCrisp sandwiches. The line was eventually replaced with the BK King's Collection menu of Angus-based sandwiches. It also sold Angus-burgers in Australia, Great Britain and Ireland. In East Asia, the chains sells the Angus XT sandwich which is a variant of the Steakhouse XT. In Great Britain, the chain has also introduced a burger based on lamb and another based on Wagyu beef, while back in the United States it sold a turkey burger sandwich - all of which were limited time offerings (LTOs).
To promote continuing interest in these products, Burger King occasionally released limited-time (LTO) variants on its premium burgers that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major business strategies, these sandwiches have sometimes been the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product group within the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.[Notes 3]

Sliders[edit]
Main article: Burger King sliders




An order of BK Burger Shots


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King has sold a variety of sliders, or mini-sandwiches, since the 1980s. Burger Bundles was the first iteration, a set of three small hamburgers or cheeseburgers. These sandwiches were eventually replaced with a reformulated product called Burger Buddies that was sold in pairs. After a change in management in 2004, Burger Buddies were re-released as BK Burger Shots. The company has also sold several chicken and breakfast sandwich versions of these products.
During the periods these products were sold, they were often the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major products in the company's portfolio, Burger King had registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the products, most of which have since lapsed.[Notes 4]

BK Stackers[edit]
Main article: BK Stacker




A BK Stacker sandwich


The BK Stacker sandwiches were a family of hamburgers featuring the same toppings that targets the late-teen–to–young-adult and male-oriented demographic groups.[31][32][33] It is a cheeseburger consisting of anywhere from one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) grilled beef patties, American cheese, bacon and Stacker sauce served on a sesame seed bun.
History[edit]
The BK Stacker was first introduced in the summer of 2006.[31] The chain garnered media attention due to the size of the sandwiches, particularly the Quad, and the large amount of calories and fat that the sandwich had (see the Enormous Omelet Sandwich breakfast sandwich.) In a November 2006 menu revision, the Double BK Stacker became a numbered Value meal item in North America, with the number varying by market area.
The Stacker line was updated in 2011. The stacker line was moved to the value menu with a reformulated ingredient list by deleting the top layer of cheese.[34] The changed pricing structure created a situation where the distribution of ingredients doesn't scale at the same rate as increasing numbers of burger patties. Two single Stackers at one dollar included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for two dollars. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker.[35]
Product description[edit]
The BK Stackers are a family of hamburgers, consisting of one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) hamburger patties, bacon, American cheese and the King Sauce used on the Big King served on a sesame-seed bun.
Advertising[edit]
The BK Stacker was introduced using commercials that employed groups of little people in the roles of members of the "Stackers Union". The characters were "Vin," played by Danny Woodburn, "the new guy," and various members of the "Stackers Union" construction team that work in a BK kitchen assembling the sandwiches. The tag line was "Meat, Cheese and Bacon- Stacked High". As exemplified in the advertising campaign, part of the sandwich's concept revolves around not having vegetables like lettuce, onions, or tomatoes.[31]

The BK Toppers line was a line of cheeseburgers introduced in October 2011 as limited time offer. The sandwiches featured a new 3.2 oz (91 g) chopped beef patty that features a coarser grind than the company's 2 oz (57 g) hamburger patty. The four sandwiches in the line were the Cheeseburger Deluxe, Mushroom and Swiss, Bacon and Cheddar, and Western BBQ. The sandwiches were a part of the new ownership's plans to expand its customer base beyond the 18- to 34-year-old demographic which it had been targeting over the previous several years.[22] The product resurrected a previous name from the BK Hot Toppers line of sandwiches from the 1980s.[36] They were removed from the menu in July 2012.
Advertising[edit]
The company used its advertising firm of McGarryBowen and a food-centric campaign to introduce the products.[22][37] The ads feature the tag line of More beef, more value, with the television commercials utilizing images of the ingredients of the sandwiches as they are being prepared.[22][38]

The Rodeo sandwiches are a line of similarly topped sandwiches targeting the value conscious demographic. They are topped with three onion rings and barbecue sauce served on a small sesame-seed bun, and can be made as a hamburger, cheeseburger or chicken sandwich.
History[edit]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was created to coincide with the release of the film Small Soldiers in 1998.[39] It originally was available as just a cheeseburger topped with Bull's Eye brand barbecue sauce and onion rings.[40]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was nationally discontinued in the U.S., but it was regionally available in some locations as part of Burger King's value menu.[40][41] In 2007, BK switched its barbecue sauce from Bulls-Eye to Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue sauce.[42]
In 2013, the Rodeo Burger was reintroduced in the U.S. as a new line of value sandwiches with a US$1.00 price. The new base level sandwich removed the cheese from the burger and introduced chicken version of the sandwich. The cheeseburger version was still available, but with an additional cost of up to 50¢.[43][44]
Product description[edit]
The Rodeo burger is a hamburger, consisting of a 1.7 oz (48 g) beef patty, barbecue sauce and onion rings on a sesame-seed bun. A cheeseburger variant adds a slice of American cheese, while the chicken variant swaps the beef patty out with a 2 oz (57 g) fried chicken patty and extra serving of barbecue sauce.
Advertising[edit]
The Rodeo cheeseburger was advertised using a parody of the Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson film A Few Good Men. In the commercial, Chip Hazard quoted Jack Nicholson's line "you can't handle the truth" as "you can't handle the Rodeo Burger."[45]

Poultry and fish[edit]
Specialty Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King Specialty Sandwiches




The Original Chicken Sandwich, the primary product in the Specialty Sandwich line.


The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are a line of sandwiches developed by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 as part of a new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.
Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several different names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royal in the international markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the products.[Notes 5]

Grilled chicken sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King grilled chicken sandwiches




The TenderGrill chicken sandwich, Burger King's current North American grilled chicken sandwich as of November 2013.


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have introduced a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches to its products portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, and was one of the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24-36 adult males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.
The company sells slightly different versions of the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 6]


Fish Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King fish sandwiches




An earlier version of the BK Big Fish Sandwich


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of fish sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1975. The Whaler sandwich was the first iteration, designed to compete with rival burger-chain McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich. With the addition of the company's Specialty Sandwich line in 1978, the sandwich was reformulated as the Long Fish sandwich. With the discontinuation of the Specialty Sandwich line, the sandwich was returned to its original recipe and name. With the introduction of the company's BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990, the fish sandwich became tied to the development cycle of the broiled chicken sandwich and was again reformulated and renamed as the Ocean Catch Fish fillet. When the broiled chicken sandwich underwent another reformulation in 2002, the fish sandwich was also redone and renamed as the BK Big Fish sandwich. By 2015, the sandwich had undergone several more modifications and went through a series of names including the BK Fish and Premium Alaskan fish sandwich. It is currently sold as the BK Big Fish sandwich in the United States and Canada. Internationally the fish sandwich is also known as the BK Fish, BK Fish'n Crisp burger and Fish Royale in those markets.
The company markets very few variants of the fish sandwiches, but it does offer localized versions that are specifically tailored to meet taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. Usually during the Christian religious period known as Lent, Burger King releases limited-time (LTO) variants on the sandwich that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. While the sandwich itself never has never been at the center of controversy, the sourcing of fish from Icelandic suppliers lead to a call for a boycott of Burger King because of Iceland's participation in whaling - despite a 1982 international moratorium on the practice. Despite being one of the company's major offerings, the fish sandwich is rarely the center of product advertising for the company. As a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 7]

BK Chicken Fries[edit]
Main article: BK Chicken Fries




An order of BK Chicken Fries.


BK Chicken Fries are a fried chicken product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At the time of their introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.
As one of the company's major offerings, the chicken fries are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the extreme metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product been a prominent part of the menu for the better part of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product - its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 8]

The turkey burger was introduced in 2013 as part of a spring-time limited time offering promotion called Festival of Burgers.[46] The new sandwich was part of a series of new, updated or modified sandwiches and along with a revamped veggie burger, as a newer more healthier offering than its beef-based burgers. With the introduction of the sandwich, the chain became the largest restaurant chain to offer a turkey burger as part of its menu.[46] Despite being declared a healthier option, the sandwich still weighed in at 10 oz (280 g) and 25% of a person's daily nutritional intake by the USDA standards.[47] Despite its size, the sandwich was one of the chain’s more healthful options, approximately 50 calories more than its TenderGrill chicken sandwich giving the chain three lower-calorie non-burger options.[48]
The new burger was part of a second wave of menu restructuring that included a stuffed bacon and cheddar burger, variations on the Whopper and a new coffee line that was co-branded with Seattle's Best Coffee.[49]
The chain also moved its advertising account from McGarryBowen to new agency of record Mother in February. The agency, who had already been working with the chain for several months as a secondary ad firm, introduced a new "people-centric" advertising program for the new sandwich line-up.[50]

The Crispy Chicken Jr. is a small fried chicken sandwich that consists of a chicken patty, lettuce and mayonnaise served on a sesame seed bun. It is one of the company's value oriented products. Originally introduced in the late 1990s as the Chick'n Crisp sandwich, the name was changed in 2013. The company has released several variants on the original sandwich.
History[edit]
The sandwich was introduced in 1998 as part of a menu expansion that added a value menu which the company dubbed the Great Tastes Menu.[51] Originally the sandwich was made with a 3 oz (85 g) chicken patty, mayonnaise, pickle on a sesame-seed roll. A parmigiana style sandwich with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce called the Italian Crispy chicken sandwich was added later.[52] The sandwich was eliminated in the US in 2000 but revived in 2007 as the Spicy Chick'n Crisp sandwich. In March 2012 the company reformulated the sandwich to the original patty and changed the spicy version to include a spicy mayo instead. The name was changed in 2013 to the Crispy Chicken Jr. and a new version called the Rodeo Crispy Chicken was added 2014.
Advertising[edit]
A 2007 advertising program for the spicy version of the Chick'n Crisp used the Whoppers, a "family" in which all the males are actors wearing a Whopper sandwich costume. In the ad spot, the parents come home and find that their son is having a party, when confronted the son blames his friend "Spicy." When the father confronts Spicy, he finds Spicy making out with the Whopper's daughter. Further ads in the program uses featured Whopper Jr. and Spicy antagonizing other fast food chains, proclaiming that Burger King has a superior value menu.

The BK Veggie is a vegetarian soy-based meatless sandwich that is served at Burger King restaurants. The sandwich is not vegan, as it has dairy components, and is one of BK's health conscious oriented menu items. The BK Veggie is made with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and onions, and is served on a sesame-seed bun. The patty is supplied by Morningstar Farms.[53] In Canada, the sandwich is prepared without mayo, while the patty is flame-broiled instead of being microwaved.
History[edit]
The product was first introduced in 2002, shortly before the company's acquisition by TPG Capital, as part of a menu expansion that included a revamped King Supreme and other products designed to better compete with a similar planned menu expansion at McDonald's early the next year.[17] It was originally prepared in the same manner as a Whopper, a flame-broiled veggie patty with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion and ketchup served on a sesame-seed roll. However, unlike the Whopper, which features regular mayonnaise, a separate low-fat mayonnaise was utilized. Currently, the BK Veggie is prepared with regular mayonnaise. At the time the sandwich was vegan if the customer asked to have it cooked in a microwave oven, otherwise it was not considered vegan because it was cooked on the same equipment as the burgers and chicken.[54] At the time of its introduction, the sandwich was hailed by many as a way to not only give vegetarians more options, but as a healthy alternative that gave all consumers more choices in meal options. The Center for Science in the Public Interest lauded the sandwich's low fat content, but derided the company's other menu items introduced at the time as being unhealthy.[55] In 2005, CSPI observed, "too bad you can’t order it with less than 930 mg of sodium," which, while an increase from the 760 or 730 mg in the sandwich in 2002, was still less than the 1100 mg in the sandwich today [June 2010].
In late 2004, BK (US) entered into a partnership with Kellogg's Morningstar Farms division to offer a soy-based meatless patty. The sandwich was reformulated not to include pickles and onions, and in order to address concerns raised by vegetarian groups, the cooking method was also changed to microwaving to prevent cross-contamination with meat products.[54][dead link][56]
Classification[edit]
In UK outlets of Burger King, the BK Veggie was approved by the Vegetarian Society. Subsequently, on the menu boards, a 'Vege society approved' logo was shown next to the item name. The UK burger is also vegan when ordered without mayonnaise or cheese.[57] In the US the sandwich was approved by PETA, who not only welcomed the BK Veggie as a way to give vegetarians more choice, but also hailed the company's recent agreement with the group to seek out suppliers that employ humane treatment methods in raising their animal stock.[58][59]
However, Burger King in the US publishes a disclaimer which states: "Burger King Corporation makes no claim that the BK Veggie Burger or any other of its products meets the requirements of a vegan or vegetarian diet. The patty is cooked in the microwave."[60]
Advertising[edit]
The use of a corporate cross-promotion helped drive sales by giving the Morningstar Farms brand increased exposure and sales opportunities, while Burger King promotes an existing, trusted brand name which aids marketing efforts and encourages consumers to try the BK Veggie.[61]
Naming and trademarks[edit]
The name BK Veggie is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in the US and Canada.

Other[edit]
Breakfast sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King breakfast sandwiches
International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of breakfast sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1978. The Croissan'wich was the first major breakfast sandwich product introduced by the company.
The company sells slightly different versions of breakfast sandwich between international markets, using local breakfast traditions and tastes to cater to those regions. To promote continuing interest in the company's breakfast products, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its breakfast sandwiches that have different ingredients from standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major offerings, breakfast sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.
Yumbo[edit]
Yumbo is a ham and cheese sandwich original introduced by Burger King in 1968 and continued on the menu until 1974. In December 2014, it was announced that the sandwich would return to the menu for a limited time starting December 2.[65][66] The Yumbo is a hot ham and cheese made with Black Forest ham, American cheese, mayonnaise and lettuce on the sub roll used for the Original Chicken Sandwich. This differs from the original sandwich that was served on a hamburger roll with no toppings.[66]
Hotdogs[edit]
In February 2016, Burger King introduced hotdogs as a permanent, full-time menu item in Its American and Canadian markets. The hotdogs market under the name grilled dogs, are made from 100% beef and came in two varieties— Chili dogs and Chicago-style.
The training videos for the product quickly became an Internet meme when it was revealed that they were hosted by Snoop Dogg and a Charro. The videos were quickly leaked to YouTube, and received media attention.
Summer 2010 Ribs LTO[edit]
In the summer of 2010, Burger King took the unusual step of adding St. Louis-style pork ribs to its summer-time menu. The ribs, 3" long, bone-in ribs, sold for about $8 order and were extremely successful. The company were sold out of the ribs just over eight weeks into the ten-week run. The company began running out of its packaging halfway into the promotion.[67][68]
The company's new broiling units were one of the key pieces in the success of the product; the new flexible batch broilers were able to be cook the ribs in a relatively short period.[67]
The advertising campaign was produced by Crispin, Porter + Boguski and featured flying pigs convincing customers that a fast food restaurant could in fact produce good barbecue ribs at a reasonable price.[68]
Summer BBQ LTO programs[edit]
The summer of 2012 saw the introduction of series of limited-time, summer-oriented products. Included in the new menu were a pulled pork sandwich and variations on its Whopper and TenderCrisp chicken sandwiches; each of these new products are based on regional barbecue styles from Tennessee, the Carolinas and Texas. Rounding out the products are an ice cream sundae topped with bacon, sweet potato fries, and frozen lemonade.[69] The products are part of Burger King's ownership group plans to reverse sagging sales and diminished market share. Additionally, the new products were designed to ward off increased competition across the fast food burger restaurant industry from chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger.[70]
The Summertime BBQ menu returned in 2013, with the pulled pork sandwich, the Carolina BBQ sandwiches variants be continued. In place of the Texas BBQ sandwich variants and bacon sundae was a new BBQ rib sandwich and a series of desserts and milkshakes based on Oreo cookie products from Mondelēz International.
Cheetos Chicken Fries[edit]
On September 14, 2016, Burger King Cheetos Chicken Fries became available at participating restaurants.[71]
Whopperito[edit]
The Whopperito was a Burger King menu item that was introduced in 2016. It consists of most of the ingredients of the Whopper wrapped inside a tortilla. Instead of the ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard, the Whopperito contains queso sauce.[72] Burger King originally introduced it only at several of their Pennsylvania locations in June; on August 15, they began selling it nationwide.[73] Leslie Patton of Bloomberg News speculated that the Whopperito represented an attempt by Burger King to compete with Chipotle Mexican Grill.[74]

Burger King cheeseburgers


When the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1955, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper. The company did not add another permanent hamburger to its menu until the introduction of the Big King sandwich in 1996 in response to McDonald's Big Mac sandwich. The company began experimenting with premium hamburgers, made from higher quality ingredients, in 1978 with the introduction of its Specialty Sandwich product line. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. However, it wasn't until 2002 when the company began to work on a premium burger in earnest. On the value side, Burger King first started offering sliders to its menu in the mid-1980s and offered them off and on for the next twenty years.
The company's first major chicken product, its Original Chicken Sandwich, was also part of the company's 1978 Specialty Sandwich line. BK Chicken Tenders made their debut in a menu revision and expansion in 1985 to address the absence of a chicken fingers product akin to McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The company began offering the first, nationally available grilled chicken sandwich product when it added the BK Broiler in the early 1990s. That sandwich would go on to be reformulated and renamed several times before settling on the current TenderGrill sandwich. The chain added a second chicken finger product with the introduction of its BK Chicken Fries product in the mid-2000s. BK Chicken fries would also be removed and re-added to its menu in response to ownership changes and customer demand.
The company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu was another addition that came in with the company's in a 1978 menu expansion. Initially a clone of McDonald's breakfast line, the company began to differentiate itself with the introduction of the Crosan'wich breakfast sandwich in 1982.

Burgers[edit]
Whopper[edit]
Main article: Whopper




A Whopper sandwich


The Whopper sandwich is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's. Introduced in 1957, it has undergone several reformulations including re-sizing and bread changes. The burger is one of the best known products in the fast food industry; it is so well known that Burger King bills itself as the Home of the Whopper in its advertising and signage. Additionally, the company uses the name in its high-end concept, the BK Whopper Bar. Due to its place in the marketplace, the Whopper has prompted Burger King's competitors, mainly McDonald's with at least six different products and Wendy's with its Big Classic, to try to develop similar products designed to compete with it.[1][2][3][4][5]
The company markets several variants of the burger, such as the Whopper Jr.,[6] as well as other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business, such as the teriyaki Whopper in Japan or the LTO Canadian Whopper.[7][8][9] With the company's expansion into India, the chain introduced two new variants on the Whopper while reintroducing the chicken version of the sandwich. To accommodate practitioners of Islam and Hinduism, who make up the majority of the Indian population, the chain has eliminated beef and pork from its menu. In their place, the chain is using a combination of chicken, vegetarian patties and mutton in place of beef.[10]
To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time offerings ("LTO") on the Whopper such as the Windows 7 Whopper in Japan as a product tie-in with Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system. The hamburger contained seven stacked beef patties and measured 5 in (13 cm) high, weighed almost 2.2 lb (1.00 kg), and had more than 1,000 kcal (4,200 kJ). It was originally planned to be available for only seven days starting on 22 October 2009.[11] Due to its success in selling 6,000 sandwiches within the first four days, Burger King decided to extend the promotion period an extra nine days, ending on 6 November.[11][12]
As the signature product of the company, it is often at the center of advertising promotions, product tie-ins, and even corporate practical jokes and hoaxes such as its 1998 April Fool's Day prank where Burger King took out a full page advertisement in several national publications, such as USA Today, promoting a new version of the sandwich called the "Left-Handed Whopper". The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180° to accommodate southpaws.[13] Some of the early twenty-first century advertising programs, particularly in Europe, have drawn criticism for cultural insensitivity or misogyny. One such example was The Texican Whopper, an LTO version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a lucha libre wrestler.[14] The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans. Additionally, the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape that appeared to be a Mexican flag, a violation of Mexican laws governing the usage of its national banner.[15] Additionally, as the signature product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product. Specifically, the name "Whopper" is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in all markets it is sold.[Notes 1]

Big King[edit]
Main article: Big King




The European version of the Big King sandwich


The Big King sandwich is one of the major hamburger products sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King, and has been part of its menu for more than twenty years. During its testing phase in 1996-1997, it was originally called the Double Supreme and was configured similarly to the McDonald's Big Mac—including a three piece roll.[16] It was later reformulated as a more standard double burger during the latter part of product testing in 1997. It was given its current name when the product was formally introduced in September 1997, but maintained the more conventional double cheeseburger format.[17] Its introduction capped a period of sales success for Burger King, where the company successfully took on its rival McDonald's.[18] The product was renamed King Supreme in 2001 when it was slightly reformulated as part of a menu restructuring during a period of corporate decline for the company in which its corporate parent, Diageo, was trying to sell the company.[17] When a TPG Capital-led team of investors took over the company in 2002, the new management team again restructured the menu, eliminating the King Supreme in favor of its new BK Stacker line of sandwiches. The sandwiches were part of a line of controversial sandwiches high in fat and calories which several groups protested.[19][20][21] A limited time offering (LTO) sandwich line known as BK Toppers accompanied the Stacker line briefly in 2012, including one sandwich known as the Deluxe topper — a virtual clone of the Big King in its formulation.[22] The Stacker and Topper lines were discontinued in the United States shortly after, and the Big King returned to said market in November 2013 as a permanent product after the company was again sold, this time to 3G Capital of Brazil.[23][24]
Despite being off the menu in the United States for several years, the product was still sold in several other countries under several names during the interim of its unavailability in the United States.[25][26] One such example sold by BK's European arm of the company is a larger version of the sandwich called the Big King XXL, based on the company's Whopper sandwich. The Big King XXL is part of a line of larger double cheeseburgers known as the BK XXL line; the XXL line was the center of controversy over product health standards and advertising in Spain when first introduced.[27] There is also a chicken variant of the sandwich in the United States and Canada.[28] To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time variants on the Big King.[29] Being one of the company's major offerings, the Big King sandwich is sometimes at the center of advertising promotions and product tie-ins.[30] Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 2]

Premium burgers[edit]
Main article: Burger King premium burgers




The Steakhouse XT sandwich


As far back as the 1970s, international fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.
The chain's first major attempt was part of their Specialty Sandwich line that was introduced in 1979 was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. After the failure of the Specialty Sandwich line, Burger King went on to introduce several other premium burgers made from a variety of meats. One major example introduced in 2002 was the BK Back Porch Griller sandwich line. The sandwich, introduced in May 2002 was a pronounced failure, and pulled in September of that year. The next product Burger King introduced was its Angus Steakburger which it began selling in 2004; it too had lack-luster sales due in part to the patty being par cooked. The sandwich was later reformulated as the Steakhouse Burger which used a thinner, flatter, fresh cooked patty. The Steakhouse Burger sandwich was eventually replaced with the Steakhouse XT/Angus XT burger, which used a new, thicker round patty among several other changes. This newer sandwich was made possible with the introduction of the company's new broiler systems which allowed varying cooking times and temperatures which in turn gave the company the ability to utilize fresh cooked, thicker patties in its sandwiches. Only variations of the sandwich that explicitly state "Angus" in the title are manufactured from meat from Angus cattle. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America.
Internationally, the chain has introduced several lines of premium sandwiches. In New Zealand, the chain first introduced the BK Crown Jewels line which was based upon the Whopper, TenderGrill, and TenderCrisp sandwiches. The line was eventually replaced with the BK King's Collection menu of Angus-based sandwiches. It also sold Angus-burgers in Australia, Great Britain and Ireland. In East Asia, the chains sells the Angus XT sandwich which is a variant of the Steakhouse XT. In Great Britain, the chain has also introduced a burger based on lamb and another based on Wagyu beef, while back in the United States it sold a turkey burger sandwich - all of which were limited time offerings (LTOs).
To promote continuing interest in these products, Burger King occasionally released limited-time (LTO) variants on its premium burgers that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major business strategies, these sandwiches have sometimes been the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product group within the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.[Notes 3]

Sliders[edit]
Main article: Burger King sliders




An order of BK Burger Shots


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King has sold a variety of sliders, or mini-sandwiches, since the 1980s. Burger Bundles was the first iteration, a set of three small hamburgers or cheeseburgers. These sandwiches were eventually replaced with a reformulated product called Burger Buddies that was sold in pairs. After a change in management in 2004, Burger Buddies were re-released as BK Burger Shots. The company has also sold several chicken and breakfast sandwich versions of these products.
During the periods these products were sold, they were often the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major products in the company's portfolio, Burger King had registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the products, most of which have since lapsed.[Notes 4]

BK Stackers[edit]
Main article: BK Stacker




A BK Stacker sandwich


The BK Stacker sandwiches were a family of hamburgers featuring the same toppings that targets the late-teen–to–young-adult and male-oriented demographic groups.[31][32][33] It is a cheeseburger consisting of anywhere from one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) grilled beef patties, American cheese, bacon and Stacker sauce served on a sesame seed bun.
History[edit]
The BK Stacker was first introduced in the summer of 2006.[31] The chain garnered media attention due to the size of the sandwiches, particularly the Quad, and the large amount of calories and fat that the sandwich had (see the Enormous Omelet Sandwich breakfast sandwich.) In a November 2006 menu revision, the Double BK Stacker became a numbered Value meal item in North America, with the number varying by market area.
The Stacker line was updated in 2011. The stacker line was moved to the value menu with a reformulated ingredient list by deleting the top layer of cheese.[34] The changed pricing structure created a situation where the distribution of ingredients doesn't scale at the same rate as increasing numbers of burger patties. Two single Stackers at one dollar included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for two dollars. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker.[35]
Product description[edit]
The BK Stackers are a family of hamburgers, consisting of one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) hamburger patties, bacon, American cheese and the King Sauce used on the Big King served on a sesame-seed bun.
Advertising[edit]
The BK Stacker was introduced using commercials that employed groups of little people in the roles of members of the "Stackers Union". The characters were "Vin," played by Danny Woodburn, "the new guy," and various members of the "Stackers Union" construction team that work in a BK kitchen assembling the sandwiches. The tag line was "Meat, Cheese and Bacon- Stacked High". As exemplified in the advertising campaign, part of the sandwich's concept revolves around not having vegetables like lettuce, onions, or tomatoes.[31]

The BK Toppers line was a line of cheeseburgers introduced in October 2011 as limited time offer. The sandwiches featured a new 3.2 oz (91 g) chopped beef patty that features a coarser grind than the company's 2 oz (57 g) hamburger patty. The four sandwiches in the line were the Cheeseburger Deluxe, Mushroom and Swiss, Bacon and Cheddar, and Western BBQ. The sandwiches were a part of the new ownership's plans to expand its customer base beyond the 18- to 34-year-old demographic which it had been targeting over the previous several years.[22] The product resurrected a previous name from the BK Hot Toppers line of sandwiches from the 1980s.[36] They were removed from the menu in July 2012.
Advertising[edit]
The company used its advertising firm of McGarryBowen and a food-centric campaign to introduce the products.[22][37] The ads feature the tag line of More beef, more value, with the television commercials utilizing images of the ingredients of the sandwiches as they are being prepared.[22][38]

The Rodeo sandwiches are a line of similarly topped sandwiches targeting the value conscious demographic. They are topped with three onion rings and barbecue sauce served on a small sesame-seed bun, and can be made as a hamburger, cheeseburger or chicken sandwich.
History[edit]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was created to coincide with the release of the film Small Soldiers in 1998.[39] It originally was available as just a cheeseburger topped with Bull's Eye brand barbecue sauce and onion rings.[40]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was nationally discontinued in the U.S., but it was regionally available in some locations as part of Burger King's value menu.[40][41] In 2007, BK switched its barbecue sauce from Bulls-Eye to Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue sauce.[42]
In 2013, the Rodeo Burger was reintroduced in the U.S. as a new line of value sandwiches with a US$1.00 price. The new base level sandwich removed the cheese from the burger and introduced chicken version of the sandwich. The cheeseburger version was still available, but with an additional cost of up to 50¢.[43][44]
Product description[edit]
The Rodeo burger is a hamburger, consisting of a 1.7 oz (48 g) beef patty, barbecue sauce and onion rings on a sesame-seed bun. A cheeseburger variant adds a slice of American cheese, while the chicken variant swaps the beef patty out with a 2 oz (57 g) fried chicken patty and extra serving of barbecue sauce.
Advertising[edit]
The Rodeo cheeseburger was advertised using a parody of the Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson film A Few Good Men. In the commercial, Chip Hazard quoted Jack Nicholson's line "you can't handle the truth" as "you can't handle the Rodeo Burger."[45]

Poultry and fish[edit]
Specialty Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King Specialty Sandwiches




The Original Chicken Sandwich, the primary product in the Specialty Sandwich line.


The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are a line of sandwiches developed by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 as part of a new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.
Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several different names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royal in the international markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the products.[Notes 5]

Grilled chicken sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King grilled chicken sandwiches




The TenderGrill chicken sandwich, Burger King's current North American grilled chicken sandwich as of November 2013.


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have introduced a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches to its products portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, and was one of the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24-36 adult males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.
The company sells slightly different versions of the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 6]


Fish Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King fish sandwiches




An earlier version of the BK Big Fish Sandwich


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of fish sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1975. The Whaler sandwich was the first iteration, designed to compete with rival burger-chain McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich. With the addition of the company's Specialty Sandwich line in 1978, the sandwich was reformulated as the Long Fish sandwich. With the discontinuation of the Specialty Sandwich line, the sandwich was returned to its original recipe and name. With the introduction of the company's BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990, the fish sandwich became tied to the development cycle of the broiled chicken sandwich and was again reformulated and renamed as the Ocean Catch Fish fillet. When the broiled chicken sandwich underwent another reformulation in 2002, the fish sandwich was also redone and renamed as the BK Big Fish sandwich. By 2015, the sandwich had undergone several more modifications and went through a series of names including the BK Fish and Premium Alaskan fish sandwich. It is currently sold as the BK Big Fish sandwich in the United States and Canada. Internationally the fish sandwich is also known as the BK Fish, BK Fish'n Crisp burger and Fish Royale in those markets.
The company markets very few variants of the fish sandwiches, but it does offer localized versions that are specifically tailored to meet taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. Usually during the Christian religious period known as Lent, Burger King releases limited-time (LTO) variants on the sandwich that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. While the sandwich itself never has never been at the center of controversy, the sourcing of fish from Icelandic suppliers lead to a call for a boycott of Burger King because of Iceland's participation in whaling - despite a 1982 international moratorium on the practice. Despite being one of the company's major offerings, the fish sandwich is rarely the center of product advertising for the company. As a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 7]

BK Chicken Fries[edit]
Main article: BK Chicken Fries




An order of BK Chicken Fries.


BK Chicken Fries are a fried chicken product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At the time of their introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.
As one of the company's major offerings, the chicken fries are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the extreme metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product been a prominent part of the menu for the better part of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product - its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 8]

The turkey burger was introduced in 2013 as part of a spring-time limited time offering promotion called Festival of Burgers.[46] The new sandwich was part of a series of new, updated or modified sandwiches and along with a revamped veggie burger, as a newer more healthier offering than its beef-based burgers. With the introduction of the sandwich, the chain became the largest restaurant chain to offer a turkey burger as part of its menu.[46] Despite being declared a healthier option, the sandwich still weighed in at 10 oz (280 g) and 25% of a person's daily nutritional intake by the USDA standards.[47] Despite its size, the sandwich was one of the chain’s more healthful options, approximately 50 calories more than its TenderGrill chicken sandwich giving the chain three lower-calorie non-burger options.[48]
The new burger was part of a second wave of menu restructuring that included a stuffed bacon and cheddar burger, variations on the Whopper and a new coffee line that was co-branded with Seattle's Best Coffee.[49]
The chain also moved its advertising account from McGarryBowen to new agency of record Mother in February. The agency, who had already been working with the chain for several months as a secondary ad firm, introduced a new "people-centric" advertising program for the new sandwich line-up.[50]

The Crispy Chicken Jr. is a small fried chicken sandwich that consists of a chicken patty, lettuce and mayonnaise served on a sesame seed bun. It is one of the company's value oriented products. Originally introduced in the late 1990s as the Chick'n Crisp sandwich, the name was changed in 2013. The company has released several variants on the original sandwich.
History[edit]
The sandwich was introduced in 1998 as part of a menu expansion that added a value menu which the company dubbed the Great Tastes Menu.[51] Originally the sandwich was made with a 3 oz (85 g) chicken patty, mayonnaise, pickle on a sesame-seed roll. A parmigiana style sandwich with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce called the Italian Crispy chicken sandwich was added later.[52] The sandwich was eliminated in the US in 2000 but revived in 2007 as the Spicy Chick'n Crisp sandwich. In March 2012 the company reformulated the sandwich to the original patty and changed the spicy version to include a spicy mayo instead. The name was changed in 2013 to the Crispy Chicken Jr. and a new version called the Rodeo Crispy Chicken was added 2014.
Advertising[edit]
A 2007 advertising program for the spicy version of the Chick'n Crisp used the Whoppers, a "family" in which all the males are actors wearing a Whopper sandwich costume. In the ad spot, the parents come home and find that their son is having a party, when confronted the son blames his friend "Spicy." When the father confronts Spicy, he finds Spicy making out with the Whopper's daughter. Further ads in the program uses featured Whopper Jr. and Spicy antagonizing other fast food chains, proclaiming that Burger King has a superior value menu.

The BK Veggie is a vegetarian soy-based meatless sandwich that is served at Burger King restaurants. The sandwich is not vegan, as it has dairy components, and is one of BK's health conscious oriented menu items. The BK Veggie is made with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and onions, and is served on a sesame-seed bun. The patty is supplied by Morningstar Farms.[53] In Canada, the sandwich is prepared without mayo, while the patty is flame-broiled instead of being microwaved.
History[edit]
The product was first introduced in 2002, shortly before the company's acquisition by TPG Capital, as part of a menu expansion that included a revamped King Supreme and other products designed to better compete with a similar planned menu expansion at McDonald's early the next year.[17] It was originally prepared in the same manner as a Whopper, a flame-broiled veggie patty with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion and ketchup served on a sesame-seed roll. However, unlike the Whopper, which features regular mayonnaise, a separate low-fat mayonnaise was utilized. Currently, the BK Veggie is prepared with regular mayonnaise. At the time the sandwich was vegan if the customer asked to have it cooked in a microwave oven, otherwise it was not considered vegan because it was cooked on the same equipment as the burgers and chicken.[54] At the time of its introduction, the sandwich was hailed by many as a way to not only give vegetarians more options, but as a healthy alternative that gave all consumers more choices in meal options. The Center for Science in the Public Interest lauded the sandwich's low fat content, but derided the company's other menu items introduced at the time as being unhealthy.[55] In 2005, CSPI observed, "too bad you can’t order it with less than 930 mg of sodium," which, while an increase from the 760 or 730 mg in the sandwich in 2002, was still less than the 1100 mg in the sandwich today [June 2010].
In late 2004, BK (US) entered into a partnership with Kellogg's Morningstar Farms division to offer a soy-based meatless patty. The sandwich was reformulated not to include pickles and onions, and in order to address concerns raised by vegetarian groups, the cooking method was also changed to microwaving to prevent cross-contamination with meat products.[54][dead link][56]
Classification[edit]
In UK outlets of Burger King, the BK Veggie was approved by the Vegetarian Society. Subsequently, on the menu boards, a 'Vege society approved' logo was shown next to the item name. The UK burger is also vegan when ordered without mayonnaise or cheese.[57] In the US the sandwich was approved by PETA, who not only welcomed the BK Veggie as a way to give vegetarians more choice, but also hailed the company's recent agreement with the group to seek out suppliers that employ humane treatment methods in raising their animal stock.[58][59]
However, Burger King in the US publishes a disclaimer which states: "Burger King Corporation makes no claim that the BK Veggie Burger or any other of its products meets the requirements of a vegan or vegetarian diet. The patty is cooked in the microwave."[60]
Advertising[edit]
The use of a corporate cross-promotion helped drive sales by giving the Morningstar Farms brand increased exposure and sales opportunities, while Burger King promotes an existing, trusted brand name which aids marketing efforts and encourages consumers to try the BK Veggie.[61]
Naming and trademarks[edit]
The name BK Veggie is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in the US and Canada.

Other[edit]
Breakfast sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King breakfast sandwiches
International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of breakfast sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1978. The Croissan'wich was the first major breakfast sandwich product introduced by the company.
The company sells slightly different versions of breakfast sandwich between international markets, using local breakfast traditions and tastes to cater to those regions. To promote continuing interest in the company's breakfast products, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its breakfast sandwiches that have different ingredients from standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major offerings, breakfast sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.
Yumbo[edit]
Yumbo is a ham and cheese sandwich original introduced by Burger King in 1968 and continued on the menu until 1974. In December 2014, it was announced that the sandwich would return to the menu for a limited time starting December 2.[65][66] The Yumbo is a hot ham and cheese made with Black Forest ham, American cheese, mayonnaise and lettuce on the sub roll used for the Original Chicken Sandwich. This differs from the original sandwich that was served on a hamburger roll with no toppings.[66]
Hotdogs[edit]
In February 2016, Burger King introduced hotdogs as a permanent, full-time menu item in Its American and Canadian markets. The hotdogs market under the name grilled dogs, are made from 100% beef and came in two varieties— Chili dogs and Chicago-style.
The training videos for the product quickly became an Internet meme when it was revealed that they were hosted by Snoop Dogg and a Charro. The videos were quickly leaked to YouTube, and received media attention.
Summer 2010 Ribs LTO[edit]
In the summer of 2010, Burger King took the unusual step of adding St. Louis-style pork ribs to its summer-time menu. The ribs, 3" long, bone-in ribs, sold for about $8 order and were extremely successful. The company were sold out of the ribs just over eight weeks into the ten-week run. The company began running out of its packaging halfway into the promotion.[67][68]
The company's new broiling units were one of the key pieces in the success of the product; the new flexible batch broilers were able to be cook the ribs in a relatively short period.[67]
The advertising campaign was produced by Crispin, Porter + Boguski and featured flying pigs convincing customers that a fast food restaurant could in fact produce good barbecue ribs at a reasonable price.[68]
Summer BBQ LTO programs[edit]
The summer of 2012 saw the introduction of series of limited-time, summer-oriented products. Included in the new menu were a pulled pork sandwich and variations on its Whopper and TenderCrisp chicken sandwiches; each of these new products are based on regional barbecue styles from Tennessee, the Carolinas and Texas. Rounding out the products are an ice cream sundae topped with bacon, sweet potato fries, and frozen lemonade.[69] The products are part of Burger King's ownership group plans to reverse sagging sales and diminished market share. Additionally, the new products were designed to ward off increased competition across the fast food burger restaurant industry from chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger.[70]
The Summertime BBQ menu returned in 2013, with the pulled pork sandwich, the Carolina BBQ sandwiches variants be continued. In place of the Texas BBQ sandwich variants and bacon sundae was a new BBQ rib sandwich and a series of desserts and milkshakes based on Oreo cookie products from Mondelēz International.
Cheetos Chicken Fries[edit]
On September 14, 2016, Burger King Cheetos Chicken Fries became available at participating restaurants.[71]
Whopperito[edit]
The Whopperito was a Burger King menu item that was introduced in 2016. It consists of most of the ingredients of the Whopper wrapped inside a tortilla. Instead of the ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard, the Whopperito contains queso sauce.[72] Burger King originally introduced it only at several of their Pennsylvania locations in June; on August 15, they began selling it nationwide.[73] Leslie Patton of Bloomberg News speculated that the Whopperito represented an attempt by Burger King to compete with Chipotle Mexican Grill.[74]

Burger King cheeseburgers


When the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1955, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper. The company did not add another permanent hamburger to its menu until the introduction of the Big King sandwich in 1996 in response to McDonald's Big Mac sandwich. The company began experimenting with premium hamburgers, made from higher quality ingredients, in 1978 with the introduction of its Specialty Sandwich product line. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. However, it wasn't until 2002 when the company began to work on a premium burger in earnest. On the value side, Burger King first started offering sliders to its menu in the mid-1980s and offered them off and on for the next twenty years.
The company's first major chicken product, its Original Chicken Sandwich, was also part of the company's 1978 Specialty Sandwich line. BK Chicken Tenders made their debut in a menu revision and expansion in 1985 to address the absence of a chicken fingers product akin to McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The company began offering the first, nationally available grilled chicken sandwich product when it added the BK Broiler in the early 1990s. That sandwich would go on to be reformulated and renamed several times before settling on the current TenderGrill sandwich. The chain added a second chicken finger product with the introduction of its BK Chicken Fries product in the mid-2000s. BK Chicken fries would also be removed and re-added to its menu in response to ownership changes and customer demand.
The company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu was another addition that came in with the company's in a 1978 menu expansion. Initially a clone of McDonald's breakfast line, the company began to differentiate itself with the introduction of the Crosan'wich breakfast sandwich in 1982.

A Whopper sandwich


The Whopper sandwich is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's. Introduced in 1957, it has undergone several reformulations including re-sizing and bread changes. The burger is one of the best known products in the fast food industry; it is so well known that Burger King bills itself as the Home of the Whopper in its advertising and signage. Additionally, the company uses the name in its high-end concept, the BK Whopper Bar. Due to its place in the marketplace, the Whopper has prompted Burger King's competitors, mainly McDonald's with at least six different products and Wendy's with its Big Classic, to try to develop similar products designed to compete with it.[1][2][3][4][5]
The company markets several variants of the burger, such as the Whopper Jr.,[6] as well as other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business, such as the teriyaki Whopper in Japan or the LTO Canadian Whopper.[7][8][9] With the company's expansion into India, the chain introduced two new variants on the Whopper while reintroducing the chicken version of the sandwich. To accommodate practitioners of Islam and Hinduism, who make up the majority of the Indian population, the chain has eliminated beef and pork from its menu. In their place, the chain is using a combination of chicken, vegetarian patties and mutton in place of beef.[10]
To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time offerings ("LTO") on the Whopper such as the Windows 7 Whopper in Japan as a product tie-in with Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system. The hamburger contained seven stacked beef patties and measured 5 in (13 cm) high, weighed almost 2.2 lb (1.00 kg), and had more than 1,000 kcal (4,200 kJ). It was originally planned to be available for only seven days starting on 22 October 2009.[11] Due to its success in selling 6,000 sandwiches within the first four days, Burger King decided to extend the promotion period an extra nine days, ending on 6 November.[11][12]
As the signature product of the company, it is often at the center of advertising promotions, product tie-ins, and even corporate practical jokes and hoaxes such as its 1998 April Fool's Day prank where Burger King took out a full page advertisement in several national publications, such as USA Today, promoting a new version of the sandwich called the "Left-Handed Whopper". The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180° to accommodate southpaws.[13] Some of the early twenty-first century advertising programs, particularly in Europe, have drawn criticism for cultural insensitivity or misogyny. One such example was The Texican Whopper, an LTO version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a lucha libre wrestler.[14] The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans. Additionally, the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape that appeared to be a Mexican flag, a violation of Mexican laws governing the usage of its national banner.[15] Additionally, as the signature product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product. Specifically, the name "Whopper" is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in all markets it is sold.[Notes 1]

Big King[edit]

The European version of the Big King sandwich


The Big King sandwich is one of the major hamburger products sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King, and has been part of its menu for more than twenty years. During its testing phase in 1996-1997, it was originally called the Double Supreme and was configured similarly to the McDonald's Big Mac—including a three piece roll.[16] It was later reformulated as a more standard double burger during the latter part of product testing in 1997. It was given its current name when the product was formally introduced in September 1997, but maintained the more conventional double cheeseburger format.[17] Its introduction capped a period of sales success for Burger King, where the company successfully took on its rival McDonald's.[18] The product was renamed King Supreme in 2001 when it was slightly reformulated as part of a menu restructuring during a period of corporate decline for the company in which its corporate parent, Diageo, was trying to sell the company.[17] When a TPG Capital-led team of investors took over the company in 2002, the new management team again restructured the menu, eliminating the King Supreme in favor of its new BK Stacker line of sandwiches. The sandwiches were part of a line of controversial sandwiches high in fat and calories which several groups protested.[19][20][21] A limited time offering (LTO) sandwich line known as BK Toppers accompanied the Stacker line briefly in 2012, including one sandwich known as the Deluxe topper — a virtual clone of the Big King in its formulation.[22] The Stacker and Topper lines were discontinued in the United States shortly after, and the Big King returned to said market in November 2013 as a permanent product after the company was again sold, this time to 3G Capital of Brazil.[23][24]
Despite being off the menu in the United States for several years, the product was still sold in several other countries under several names during the interim of its unavailability in the United States.[25][26] One such example sold by BK's European arm of the company is a larger version of the sandwich called the Big King XXL, based on the company's Whopper sandwich. The Big King XXL is part of a line of larger double cheeseburgers known as the BK XXL line; the XXL line was the center of controversy over product health standards and advertising in Spain when first introduced.[27] There is also a chicken variant of the sandwich in the United States and Canada.[28] To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time variants on the Big King.[29] Being one of the company's major offerings, the Big King sandwich is sometimes at the center of advertising promotions and product tie-ins.[30] Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 2]

Premium burgers[edit]
Main article: Burger King premium burgers




The Steakhouse XT sandwich


As far back as the 1970s, international fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.
The chain's first major attempt was part of their Specialty Sandwich line that was introduced in 1979 was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. After the failure of the Specialty Sandwich line, Burger King went on to introduce several other premium burgers made from a variety of meats. One major example introduced in 2002 was the BK Back Porch Griller sandwich line. The sandwich, introduced in May 2002 was a pronounced failure, and pulled in September of that year. The next product Burger King introduced was its Angus Steakburger which it began selling in 2004; it too had lack-luster sales due in part to the patty being par cooked. The sandwich was later reformulated as the Steakhouse Burger which used a thinner, flatter, fresh cooked patty. The Steakhouse Burger sandwich was eventually replaced with the Steakhouse XT/Angus XT burger, which used a new, thicker round patty among several other changes. This newer sandwich was made possible with the introduction of the company's new broiler systems which allowed varying cooking times and temperatures which in turn gave the company the ability to utilize fresh cooked, thicker patties in its sandwiches. Only variations of the sandwich that explicitly state "Angus" in the title are manufactured from meat from Angus cattle. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America.
Internationally, the chain has introduced several lines of premium sandwiches. In New Zealand, the chain first introduced the BK Crown Jewels line which was based upon the Whopper, TenderGrill, and TenderCrisp sandwiches. The line was eventually replaced with the BK King's Collection menu of Angus-based sandwiches. It also sold Angus-burgers in Australia, Great Britain and Ireland. In East Asia, the chains sells the Angus XT sandwich which is a variant of the Steakhouse XT. In Great Britain, the chain has also introduced a burger based on lamb and another based on Wagyu beef, while back in the United States it sold a turkey burger sandwich - all of which were limited time offerings (LTOs).
To promote continuing interest in these products, Burger King occasionally released limited-time (LTO) variants on its premium burgers that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major business strategies, these sandwiches have sometimes been the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product group within the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.[Notes 3]

Sliders[edit]
Main article: Burger King sliders




An order of BK Burger Shots


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King has sold a variety of sliders, or mini-sandwiches, since the 1980s. Burger Bundles was the first iteration, a set of three small hamburgers or cheeseburgers. These sandwiches were eventually replaced with a reformulated product called Burger Buddies that was sold in pairs. After a change in management in 2004, Burger Buddies were re-released as BK Burger Shots. The company has also sold several chicken and breakfast sandwich versions of these products.
During the periods these products were sold, they were often the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major products in the company's portfolio, Burger King had registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the products, most of which have since lapsed.[Notes 4]

BK Stackers[edit]
Main article: BK Stacker




A BK Stacker sandwich


The BK Stacker sandwiches were a family of hamburgers featuring the same toppings that targets the late-teen–to–young-adult and male-oriented demographic groups.[31][32][33] It is a cheeseburger consisting of anywhere from one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) grilled beef patties, American cheese, bacon and Stacker sauce served on a sesame seed bun.
History[edit]
The BK Stacker was first introduced in the summer of 2006.[31] The chain garnered media attention due to the size of the sandwiches, particularly the Quad, and the large amount of calories and fat that the sandwich had (see the Enormous Omelet Sandwich breakfast sandwich.) In a November 2006 menu revision, the Double BK Stacker became a numbered Value meal item in North America, with the number varying by market area.
The Stacker line was updated in 2011. The stacker line was moved to the value menu with a reformulated ingredient list by deleting the top layer of cheese.[34] The changed pricing structure created a situation where the distribution of ingredients doesn't scale at the same rate as increasing numbers of burger patties. Two single Stackers at one dollar included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for two dollars. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker.[35]
Product description[edit]
The BK Stackers are a family of hamburgers, consisting of one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) hamburger patties, bacon, American cheese and the King Sauce used on the Big King served on a sesame-seed bun.
Advertising[edit]
The BK Stacker was introduced using commercials that employed groups of little people in the roles of members of the "Stackers Union". The characters were "Vin," played by Danny Woodburn, "the new guy," and various members of the "Stackers Union" construction team that work in a BK kitchen assembling the sandwiches. The tag line was "Meat, Cheese and Bacon- Stacked High". As exemplified in the advertising campaign, part of the sandwich's concept revolves around not having vegetables like lettuce, onions, or tomatoes.[31]

The BK Toppers line was a line of cheeseburgers introduced in October 2011 as limited time offer. The sandwiches featured a new 3.2 oz (91 g) chopped beef patty that features a coarser grind than the company's 2 oz (57 g) hamburger patty. The four sandwiches in the line were the Cheeseburger Deluxe, Mushroom and Swiss, Bacon and Cheddar, and Western BBQ. The sandwiches were a part of the new ownership's plans to expand its customer base beyond the 18- to 34-year-old demographic which it had been targeting over the previous several years.[22] The product resurrected a previous name from the BK Hot Toppers line of sandwiches from the 1980s.[36] They were removed from the menu in July 2012.
Advertising[edit]
The company used its advertising firm of McGarryBowen and a food-centric campaign to introduce the products.[22][37] The ads feature the tag line of More beef, more value, with the television commercials utilizing images of the ingredients of the sandwiches as they are being prepared.[22][38]

The Rodeo sandwiches are a line of similarly topped sandwiches targeting the value conscious demographic. They are topped with three onion rings and barbecue sauce served on a small sesame-seed bun, and can be made as a hamburger, cheeseburger or chicken sandwich.
History[edit]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was created to coincide with the release of the film Small Soldiers in 1998.[39] It originally was available as just a cheeseburger topped with Bull's Eye brand barbecue sauce and onion rings.[40]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was nationally discontinued in the U.S., but it was regionally available in some locations as part of Burger King's value menu.[40][41] In 2007, BK switched its barbecue sauce from Bulls-Eye to Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue sauce.[42]
In 2013, the Rodeo Burger was reintroduced in the U.S. as a new line of value sandwiches with a US$1.00 price. The new base level sandwich removed the cheese from the burger and introduced chicken version of the sandwich. The cheeseburger version was still available, but with an additional cost of up to 50¢.[43][44]
Product description[edit]
The Rodeo burger is a hamburger, consisting of a 1.7 oz (48 g) beef patty, barbecue sauce and onion rings on a sesame-seed bun. A cheeseburger variant adds a slice of American cheese, while the chicken variant swaps the beef patty out with a 2 oz (57 g) fried chicken patty and extra serving of barbecue sauce.
Advertising[edit]
The Rodeo cheeseburger was advertised using a parody of the Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson film A Few Good Men. In the commercial, Chip Hazard quoted Jack Nicholson's line "you can't handle the truth" as "you can't handle the Rodeo Burger."[45]

Poultry and fish[edit]
Specialty Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King Specialty Sandwiches




The Original Chicken Sandwich, the primary product in the Specialty Sandwich line.


The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are a line of sandwiches developed by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 as part of a new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.
Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several different names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royal in the international markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the products.[Notes 5]

Grilled chicken sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King grilled chicken sandwiches




The TenderGrill chicken sandwich, Burger King's current North American grilled chicken sandwich as of November 2013.


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have introduced a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches to its products portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, and was one of the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24-36 adult males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.
The company sells slightly different versions of the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 6]


Fish Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King fish sandwiches




An earlier version of the BK Big Fish Sandwich


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of fish sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1975. The Whaler sandwich was the first iteration, designed to compete with rival burger-chain McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich. With the addition of the company's Specialty Sandwich line in 1978, the sandwich was reformulated as the Long Fish sandwich. With the discontinuation of the Specialty Sandwich line, the sandwich was returned to its original recipe and name. With the introduction of the company's BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990, the fish sandwich became tied to the development cycle of the broiled chicken sandwich and was again reformulated and renamed as the Ocean Catch Fish fillet. When the broiled chicken sandwich underwent another reformulation in 2002, the fish sandwich was also redone and renamed as the BK Big Fish sandwich. By 2015, the sandwich had undergone several more modifications and went through a series of names including the BK Fish and Premium Alaskan fish sandwich. It is currently sold as the BK Big Fish sandwich in the United States and Canada. Internationally the fish sandwich is also known as the BK Fish, BK Fish'n Crisp burger and Fish Royale in those markets.
The company markets very few variants of the fish sandwiches, but it does offer localized versions that are specifically tailored to meet taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. Usually during the Christian religious period known as Lent, Burger King releases limited-time (LTO) variants on the sandwich that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. While the sandwich itself never has never been at the center of controversy, the sourcing of fish from Icelandic suppliers lead to a call for a boycott of Burger King because of Iceland's participation in whaling - despite a 1982 international moratorium on the practice. Despite being one of the company's major offerings, the fish sandwich is rarely the center of product advertising for the company. As a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 7]

BK Chicken Fries[edit]
Main article: BK Chicken Fries




An order of BK Chicken Fries.


BK Chicken Fries are a fried chicken product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At the time of their introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.
As one of the company's major offerings, the chicken fries are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the extreme metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product been a prominent part of the menu for the better part of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product - its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 8]

The turkey burger was introduced in 2013 as part of a spring-time limited time offering promotion called Festival of Burgers.[46] The new sandwich was part of a series of new, updated or modified sandwiches and along with a revamped veggie burger, as a newer more healthier offering than its beef-based burgers. With the introduction of the sandwich, the chain became the largest restaurant chain to offer a turkey burger as part of its menu.[46] Despite being declared a healthier option, the sandwich still weighed in at 10 oz (280 g) and 25% of a person's daily nutritional intake by the USDA standards.[47] Despite its size, the sandwich was one of the chain’s more healthful options, approximately 50 calories more than its TenderGrill chicken sandwich giving the chain three lower-calorie non-burger options.[48]
The new burger was part of a second wave of menu restructuring that included a stuffed bacon and cheddar burger, variations on the Whopper and a new coffee line that was co-branded with Seattle's Best Coffee.[49]
The chain also moved its advertising account from McGarryBowen to new agency of record Mother in February. The agency, who had already been working with the chain for several months as a secondary ad firm, introduced a new "people-centric" advertising program for the new sandwich line-up.[50]

The Crispy Chicken Jr. is a small fried chicken sandwich that consists of a chicken patty, lettuce and mayonnaise served on a sesame seed bun. It is one of the company's value oriented products. Originally introduced in the late 1990s as the Chick'n Crisp sandwich, the name was changed in 2013. The company has released several variants on the original sandwich.
History[edit]
The sandwich was introduced in 1998 as part of a menu expansion that added a value menu which the company dubbed the Great Tastes Menu.[51] Originally the sandwich was made with a 3 oz (85 g) chicken patty, mayonnaise, pickle on a sesame-seed roll. A parmigiana style sandwich with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce called the Italian Crispy chicken sandwich was added later.[52] The sandwich was eliminated in the US in 2000 but revived in 2007 as the Spicy Chick'n Crisp sandwich. In March 2012 the company reformulated the sandwich to the original patty and changed the spicy version to include a spicy mayo instead. The name was changed in 2013 to the Crispy Chicken Jr. and a new version called the Rodeo Crispy Chicken was added 2014.
Advertising[edit]
A 2007 advertising program for the spicy version of the Chick'n Crisp used the Whoppers, a "family" in which all the males are actors wearing a Whopper sandwich costume. In the ad spot, the parents come home and find that their son is having a party, when confronted the son blames his friend "Spicy." When the father confronts Spicy, he finds Spicy making out with the Whopper's daughter. Further ads in the program uses featured Whopper Jr. and Spicy antagonizing other fast food chains, proclaiming that Burger King has a superior value menu.

The BK Veggie is a vegetarian soy-based meatless sandwich that is served at Burger King restaurants. The sandwich is not vegan, as it has dairy components, and is one of BK's health conscious oriented menu items. The BK Veggie is made with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and onions, and is served on a sesame-seed bun. The patty is supplied by Morningstar Farms.[53] In Canada, the sandwich is prepared without mayo, while the patty is flame-broiled instead of being microwaved.
History[edit]
The product was first introduced in 2002, shortly before the company's acquisition by TPG Capital, as part of a menu expansion that included a revamped King Supreme and other products designed to better compete with a similar planned menu expansion at McDonald's early the next year.[17] It was originally prepared in the same manner as a Whopper, a flame-broiled veggie patty with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion and ketchup served on a sesame-seed roll. However, unlike the Whopper, which features regular mayonnaise, a separate low-fat mayonnaise was utilized. Currently, the BK Veggie is prepared with regular mayonnaise. At the time the sandwich was vegan if the customer asked to have it cooked in a microwave oven, otherwise it was not considered vegan because it was cooked on the same equipment as the burgers and chicken.[54] At the time of its introduction, the sandwich was hailed by many as a way to not only give vegetarians more options, but as a healthy alternative that gave all consumers more choices in meal options. The Center for Science in the Public Interest lauded the sandwich's low fat content, but derided the company's other menu items introduced at the time as being unhealthy.[55] In 2005, CSPI observed, "too bad you can’t order it with less than 930 mg of sodium," which, while an increase from the 760 or 730 mg in the sandwich in 2002, was still less than the 1100 mg in the sandwich today [June 2010].
In late 2004, BK (US) entered into a partnership with Kellogg's Morningstar Farms division to offer a soy-based meatless patty. The sandwich was reformulated not to include pickles and onions, and in order to address concerns raised by vegetarian groups, the cooking method was also changed to microwaving to prevent cross-contamination with meat products.[54][dead link][56]
Classification[edit]
In UK outlets of Burger King, the BK Veggie was approved by the Vegetarian Society. Subsequently, on the menu boards, a 'Vege society approved' logo was shown next to the item name. The UK burger is also vegan when ordered without mayonnaise or cheese.[57] In the US the sandwich was approved by PETA, who not only welcomed the BK Veggie as a way to give vegetarians more choice, but also hailed the company's recent agreement with the group to seek out suppliers that employ humane treatment methods in raising their animal stock.[58][59]
However, Burger King in the US publishes a disclaimer which states: "Burger King Corporation makes no claim that the BK Veggie Burger or any other of its products meets the requirements of a vegan or vegetarian diet. The patty is cooked in the microwave."[60]
Advertising[edit]
The use of a corporate cross-promotion helped drive sales by giving the Morningstar Farms brand increased exposure and sales opportunities, while Burger King promotes an existing, trusted brand name which aids marketing efforts and encourages consumers to try the BK Veggie.[61]
Naming and trademarks[edit]
The name BK Veggie is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in the US and Canada.

Other[edit]
Breakfast sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King breakfast sandwiches
International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of breakfast sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1978. The Croissan'wich was the first major breakfast sandwich product introduced by the company.
The company sells slightly different versions of breakfast sandwich between international markets, using local breakfast traditions and tastes to cater to those regions. To promote continuing interest in the company's breakfast products, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its breakfast sandwiches that have different ingredients from standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major offerings, breakfast sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.
Yumbo[edit]
Yumbo is a ham and cheese sandwich original introduced by Burger King in 1968 and continued on the menu until 1974. In December 2014, it was announced that the sandwich would return to the menu for a limited time starting December 2.[65][66] The Yumbo is a hot ham and cheese made with Black Forest ham, American cheese, mayonnaise and lettuce on the sub roll used for the Original Chicken Sandwich. This differs from the original sandwich that was served on a hamburger roll with no toppings.[66]
Hotdogs[edit]
In February 2016, Burger King introduced hotdogs as a permanent, full-time menu item in Its American and Canadian markets. The hotdogs market under the name grilled dogs, are made from 100% beef and came in two varieties— Chili dogs and Chicago-style.
The training videos for the product quickly became an Internet meme when it was revealed that they were hosted by Snoop Dogg and a Charro. The videos were quickly leaked to YouTube, and received media attention.
Summer 2010 Ribs LTO[edit]
In the summer of 2010, Burger King took the unusual step of adding St. Louis-style pork ribs to its summer-time menu. The ribs, 3" long, bone-in ribs, sold for about $8 order and were extremely successful. The company were sold out of the ribs just over eight weeks into the ten-week run. The company began running out of its packaging halfway into the promotion.[67][68]
The company's new broiling units were one of the key pieces in the success of the product; the new flexible batch broilers were able to be cook the ribs in a relatively short period.[67]
The advertising campaign was produced by Crispin, Porter + Boguski and featured flying pigs convincing customers that a fast food restaurant could in fact produce good barbecue ribs at a reasonable price.[68]
Summer BBQ LTO programs[edit]
The summer of 2012 saw the introduction of series of limited-time, summer-oriented products. Included in the new menu were a pulled pork sandwich and variations on its Whopper and TenderCrisp chicken sandwiches; each of these new products are based on regional barbecue styles from Tennessee, the Carolinas and Texas. Rounding out the products are an ice cream sundae topped with bacon, sweet potato fries, and frozen lemonade.[69] The products are part of Burger King's ownership group plans to reverse sagging sales and diminished market share. Additionally, the new products were designed to ward off increased competition across the fast food burger restaurant industry from chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger.[70]
The Summertime BBQ menu returned in 2013, with the pulled pork sandwich, the Carolina BBQ sandwiches variants be continued. In place of the Texas BBQ sandwich variants and bacon sundae was a new BBQ rib sandwich and a series of desserts and milkshakes based on Oreo cookie products from Mondelēz International.
Cheetos Chicken Fries[edit]
On September 14, 2016, Burger King Cheetos Chicken Fries became available at participating restaurants.[71]
Whopperito[edit]
The Whopperito was a Burger King menu item that was introduced in 2016. It consists of most of the ingredients of the Whopper wrapped inside a tortilla. Instead of the ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard, the Whopperito contains queso sauce.[72] Burger King originally introduced it only at several of their Pennsylvania locations in June; on August 15, they began selling it nationwide.[73] Leslie Patton of Bloomberg News speculated that the Whopperito represented an attempt by Burger King to compete with Chipotle Mexican Grill.[74]

Burger King cheeseburgers


When the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1955, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper. The company did not add another permanent hamburger to its menu until the introduction of the Big King sandwich in 1996 in response to McDonald's Big Mac sandwich. The company began experimenting with premium hamburgers, made from higher quality ingredients, in 1978 with the introduction of its Specialty Sandwich product line. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. However, it wasn't until 2002 when the company began to work on a premium burger in earnest. On the value side, Burger King first started offering sliders to its menu in the mid-1980s and offered them off and on for the next twenty years.
The company's first major chicken product, its Original Chicken Sandwich, was also part of the company's 1978 Specialty Sandwich line. BK Chicken Tenders made their debut in a menu revision and expansion in 1985 to address the absence of a chicken fingers product akin to McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The company began offering the first, nationally available grilled chicken sandwich product when it added the BK Broiler in the early 1990s. That sandwich would go on to be reformulated and renamed several times before settling on the current TenderGrill sandwich. The chain added a second chicken finger product with the introduction of its BK Chicken Fries product in the mid-2000s. BK Chicken fries would also be removed and re-added to its menu in response to ownership changes and customer demand.
The company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu was another addition that came in with the company's in a 1978 menu expansion. Initially a clone of McDonald's breakfast line, the company began to differentiate itself with the introduction of the Crosan'wich breakfast sandwich in 1982.

A Whopper sandwich


The Whopper sandwich is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's. Introduced in 1957, it has undergone several reformulations including re-sizing and bread changes. The burger is one of the best known products in the fast food industry; it is so well known that Burger King bills itself as the Home of the Whopper in its advertising and signage. Additionally, the company uses the name in its high-end concept, the BK Whopper Bar. Due to its place in the marketplace, the Whopper has prompted Burger King's competitors, mainly McDonald's with at least six different products and Wendy's with its Big Classic, to try to develop similar products designed to compete with it.[1][2][3][4][5]
The company markets several variants of the burger, such as the Whopper Jr.,[6] as well as other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business, such as the teriyaki Whopper in Japan or the LTO Canadian Whopper.[7][8][9] With the company's expansion into India, the chain introduced two new variants on the Whopper while reintroducing the chicken version of the sandwich. To accommodate practitioners of Islam and Hinduism, who make up the majority of the Indian population, the chain has eliminated beef and pork from its menu. In their place, the chain is using a combination of chicken, vegetarian patties and mutton in place of beef.[10]
To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time offerings ("LTO") on the Whopper such as the Windows 7 Whopper in Japan as a product tie-in with Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system. The hamburger contained seven stacked beef patties and measured 5 in (13 cm) high, weighed almost 2.2 lb (1.00 kg), and had more than 1,000 kcal (4,200 kJ). It was originally planned to be available for only seven days starting on 22 October 2009.[11] Due to its success in selling 6,000 sandwiches within the first four days, Burger King decided to extend the promotion period an extra nine days, ending on 6 November.[11][12]
As the signature product of the company, it is often at the center of advertising promotions, product tie-ins, and even corporate practical jokes and hoaxes such as its 1998 April Fool's Day prank where Burger King took out a full page advertisement in several national publications, such as USA Today, promoting a new version of the sandwich called the "Left-Handed Whopper". The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180° to accommodate southpaws.[13] Some of the early twenty-first century advertising programs, particularly in Europe, have drawn criticism for cultural insensitivity or misogyny. One such example was The Texican Whopper, an LTO version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a lucha libre wrestler.[14] The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans. Additionally, the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape that appeared to be a Mexican flag, a violation of Mexican laws governing the usage of its national banner.[15] Additionally, as the signature product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product. Specifically, the name "Whopper" is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in all markets it is sold.[Notes 1]

Big King[edit]

The European version of the Big King sandwich


The Big King sandwich is one of the major hamburger products sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King, and has been part of its menu for more than twenty years. During its testing phase in 1996-1997, it was originally called the Double Supreme and was configured similarly to the McDonald's Big Mac—including a three piece roll.[16] It was later reformulated as a more standard double burger during the latter part of product testing in 1997. It was given its current name when the product was formally introduced in September 1997, but maintained the more conventional double cheeseburger format.[17] Its introduction capped a period of sales success for Burger King, where the company successfully took on its rival McDonald's.[18] The product was renamed King Supreme in 2001 when it was slightly reformulated as part of a menu restructuring during a period of corporate decline for the company in which its corporate parent, Diageo, was trying to sell the company.[17] When a TPG Capital-led team of investors took over the company in 2002, the new management team again restructured the menu, eliminating the King Supreme in favor of its new BK Stacker line of sandwiches. The sandwiches were part of a line of controversial sandwiches high in fat and calories which several groups protested.[19][20][21] A limited time offering (LTO) sandwich line known as BK Toppers accompanied the Stacker line briefly in 2012, including one sandwich known as the Deluxe topper — a virtual clone of the Big King in its formulation.[22] The Stacker and Topper lines were discontinued in the United States shortly after, and the Big King returned to said market in November 2013 as a permanent product after the company was again sold, this time to 3G Capital of Brazil.[23][24]
Despite being off the menu in the United States for several years, the product was still sold in several other countries under several names during the interim of its unavailability in the United States.[25][26] One such example sold by BK's European arm of the company is a larger version of the sandwich called the Big King XXL, based on the company's Whopper sandwich. The Big King XXL is part of a line of larger double cheeseburgers known as the BK XXL line; the XXL line was the center of controversy over product health standards and advertising in Spain when first introduced.[27] There is also a chicken variant of the sandwich in the United States and Canada.[28] To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time variants on the Big King.[29] Being one of the company's major offerings, the Big King sandwich is sometimes at the center of advertising promotions and product tie-ins.[30] Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 2]

Premium burgers[edit]
Main article: Burger King premium burgers




The Steakhouse XT sandwich


As far back as the 1970s, international fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.
The chain's first major attempt was part of their Specialty Sandwich line that was introduced in 1979 was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. After the failure of the Specialty Sandwich line, Burger King went on to introduce several other premium burgers made from a variety of meats. One major example introduced in 2002 was the BK Back Porch Griller sandwich line. The sandwich, introduced in May 2002 was a pronounced failure, and pulled in September of that year. The next product Burger King introduced was its Angus Steakburger which it began selling in 2004; it too had lack-luster sales due in part to the patty being par cooked. The sandwich was later reformulated as the Steakhouse Burger which used a thinner, flatter, fresh cooked patty. The Steakhouse Burger sandwich was eventually replaced with the Steakhouse XT/Angus XT burger, which used a new, thicker round patty among several other changes. This newer sandwich was made possible with the introduction of the company's new broiler systems which allowed varying cooking times and temperatures which in turn gave the company the ability to utilize fresh cooked, thicker patties in its sandwiches. Only variations of the sandwich that explicitly state "Angus" in the title are manufactured from meat from Angus cattle. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America.
Internationally, the chain has introduced several lines of premium sandwiches. In New Zealand, the chain first introduced the BK Crown Jewels line which was based upon the Whopper, TenderGrill, and TenderCrisp sandwiches. The line was eventually replaced with the BK King's Collection menu of Angus-based sandwiches. It also sold Angus-burgers in Australia, Great Britain and Ireland. In East Asia, the chains sells the Angus XT sandwich which is a variant of the Steakhouse XT. In Great Britain, the chain has also introduced a burger based on lamb and another based on Wagyu beef, while back in the United States it sold a turkey burger sandwich - all of which were limited time offerings (LTOs).
To promote continuing interest in these products, Burger King occasionally released limited-time (LTO) variants on its premium burgers that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major business strategies, these sandwiches have sometimes been the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product group within the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.[Notes 3]

Sliders[edit]
Main article: Burger King sliders




An order of BK Burger Shots


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King has sold a variety of sliders, or mini-sandwiches, since the 1980s. Burger Bundles was the first iteration, a set of three small hamburgers or cheeseburgers. These sandwiches were eventually replaced with a reformulated product called Burger Buddies that was sold in pairs. After a change in management in 2004, Burger Buddies were re-released as BK Burger Shots. The company has also sold several chicken and breakfast sandwich versions of these products.
During the periods these products were sold, they were often the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major products in the company's portfolio, Burger King had registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the products, most of which have since lapsed.[Notes 4]

BK Stackers[edit]
Main article: BK Stacker




A BK Stacker sandwich


The BK Stacker sandwiches were a family of hamburgers featuring the same toppings that targets the late-teen–to–young-adult and male-oriented demographic groups.[31][32][33] It is a cheeseburger consisting of anywhere from one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) grilled beef patties, American cheese, bacon and Stacker sauce served on a sesame seed bun.
History[edit]
The BK Stacker was first introduced in the summer of 2006.[31] The chain garnered media attention due to the size of the sandwiches, particularly the Quad, and the large amount of calories and fat that the sandwich had (see the Enormous Omelet Sandwich breakfast sandwich.) In a November 2006 menu revision, the Double BK Stacker became a numbered Value meal item in North America, with the number varying by market area.
The Stacker line was updated in 2011. The stacker line was moved to the value menu with a reformulated ingredient list by deleting the top layer of cheese.[34] The changed pricing structure created a situation where the distribution of ingredients doesn't scale at the same rate as increasing numbers of burger patties. Two single Stackers at one dollar included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for two dollars. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker.[35]
Product description[edit]
The BK Stackers are a family of hamburgers, consisting of one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) hamburger patties, bacon, American cheese and the King Sauce used on the Big King served on a sesame-seed bun.
Advertising[edit]
The BK Stacker was introduced using commercials that employed groups of little people in the roles of members of the "Stackers Union". The characters were "Vin," played by Danny Woodburn, "the new guy," and various members of the "Stackers Union" construction team that work in a BK kitchen assembling the sandwiches. The tag line was "Meat, Cheese and Bacon- Stacked High". As exemplified in the advertising campaign, part of the sandwich's concept revolves around not having vegetables like lettuce, onions, or tomatoes.[31]

The BK Toppers line was a line of cheeseburgers introduced in October 2011 as limited time offer. The sandwiches featured a new 3.2 oz (91 g) chopped beef patty that features a coarser grind than the company's 2 oz (57 g) hamburger patty. The four sandwiches in the line were the Cheeseburger Deluxe, Mushroom and Swiss, Bacon and Cheddar, and Western BBQ. The sandwiches were a part of the new ownership's plans to expand its customer base beyond the 18- to 34-year-old demographic which it had been targeting over the previous several years.[22] The product resurrected a previous name from the BK Hot Toppers line of sandwiches from the 1980s.[36] They were removed from the menu in July 2012.
Advertising[edit]
The company used its advertising firm of McGarryBowen and a food-centric campaign to introduce the products.[22][37] The ads feature the tag line of More beef, more value, with the television commercials utilizing images of the ingredients of the sandwiches as they are being prepared.[22][38]

The Rodeo sandwiches are a line of similarly topped sandwiches targeting the value conscious demographic. They are topped with three onion rings and barbecue sauce served on a small sesame-seed bun, and can be made as a hamburger, cheeseburger or chicken sandwich.
History[edit]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was created to coincide with the release of the film Small Soldiers in 1998.[39] It originally was available as just a cheeseburger topped with Bull's Eye brand barbecue sauce and onion rings.[40]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was nationally discontinued in the U.S., but it was regionally available in some locations as part of Burger King's value menu.[40][41] In 2007, BK switched its barbecue sauce from Bulls-Eye to Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue sauce.[42]
In 2013, the Rodeo Burger was reintroduced in the U.S. as a new line of value sandwiches with a US$1.00 price. The new base level sandwich removed the cheese from the burger and introduced chicken version of the sandwich. The cheeseburger version was still available, but with an additional cost of up to 50¢.[43][44]
Product description[edit]
The Rodeo burger is a hamburger, consisting of a 1.7 oz (48 g) beef patty, barbecue sauce and onion rings on a sesame-seed bun. A cheeseburger variant adds a slice of American cheese, while the chicken variant swaps the beef patty out with a 2 oz (57 g) fried chicken patty and extra serving of barbecue sauce.
Advertising[edit]
The Rodeo cheeseburger was advertised using a parody of the Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson film A Few Good Men. In the commercial, Chip Hazard quoted Jack Nicholson's line "you can't handle the truth" as "you can't handle the Rodeo Burger."[45]

Poultry and fish[edit]
Specialty Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King Specialty Sandwiches




The Original Chicken Sandwich, the primary product in the Specialty Sandwich line.


The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are a line of sandwiches developed by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 as part of a new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.
Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several different names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royal in the international markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the products.[Notes 5]

Grilled chicken sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King grilled chicken sandwiches




The TenderGrill chicken sandwich, Burger King's current North American grilled chicken sandwich as of November 2013.


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have introduced a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches to its products portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, and was one of the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24-36 adult males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.
The company sells slightly different versions of the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 6]


Fish Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King fish sandwiches




An earlier version of the BK Big Fish Sandwich


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of fish sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1975. The Whaler sandwich was the first iteration, designed to compete with rival burger-chain McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich. With the addition of the company's Specialty Sandwich line in 1978, the sandwich was reformulated as the Long Fish sandwich. With the discontinuation of the Specialty Sandwich line, the sandwich was returned to its original recipe and name. With the introduction of the company's BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990, the fish sandwich became tied to the development cycle of the broiled chicken sandwich and was again reformulated and renamed as the Ocean Catch Fish fillet. When the broiled chicken sandwich underwent another reformulation in 2002, the fish sandwich was also redone and renamed as the BK Big Fish sandwich. By 2015, the sandwich had undergone several more modifications and went through a series of names including the BK Fish and Premium Alaskan fish sandwich. It is currently sold as the BK Big Fish sandwich in the United States and Canada. Internationally the fish sandwich is also known as the BK Fish, BK Fish'n Crisp burger and Fish Royale in those markets.
The company markets very few variants of the fish sandwiches, but it does offer localized versions that are specifically tailored to meet taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. Usually during the Christian religious period known as Lent, Burger King releases limited-time (LTO) variants on the sandwich that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. While the sandwich itself never has never been at the center of controversy, the sourcing of fish from Icelandic suppliers lead to a call for a boycott of Burger King because of Iceland's participation in whaling - despite a 1982 international moratorium on the practice. Despite being one of the company's major offerings, the fish sandwich is rarely the center of product advertising for the company. As a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 7]

BK Chicken Fries[edit]
Main article: BK Chicken Fries




An order of BK Chicken Fries.


BK Chicken Fries are a fried chicken product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At the time of their introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.
As one of the company's major offerings, the chicken fries are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the extreme metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product been a prominent part of the menu for the better part of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product - its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 8]

The turkey burger was introduced in 2013 as part of a spring-time limited time offering promotion called Festival of Burgers.[46] The new sandwich was part of a series of new, updated or modified sandwiches and along with a revamped veggie burger, as a newer more healthier offering than its beef-based burgers. With the introduction of the sandwich, the chain became the largest restaurant chain to offer a turkey burger as part of its menu.[46] Despite being declared a healthier option, the sandwich still weighed in at 10 oz (280 g) and 25% of a person's daily nutritional intake by the USDA standards.[47] Despite its size, the sandwich was one of the chain’s more healthful options, approximately 50 calories more than its TenderGrill chicken sandwich giving the chain three lower-calorie non-burger options.[48]
The new burger was part of a second wave of menu restructuring that included a stuffed bacon and cheddar burger, variations on the Whopper and a new coffee line that was co-branded with Seattle's Best Coffee.[49]
The chain also moved its advertising account from McGarryBowen to new agency of record Mother in February. The agency, who had already been working with the chain for several months as a secondary ad firm, introduced a new "people-centric" advertising program for the new sandwich line-up.[50]

The Crispy Chicken Jr. is a small fried chicken sandwich that consists of a chicken patty, lettuce and mayonnaise served on a sesame seed bun. It is one of the company's value oriented products. Originally introduced in the late 1990s as the Chick'n Crisp sandwich, the name was changed in 2013. The company has released several variants on the original sandwich.
History[edit]
The sandwich was introduced in 1998 as part of a menu expansion that added a value menu which the company dubbed the Great Tastes Menu.[51] Originally the sandwich was made with a 3 oz (85 g) chicken patty, mayonnaise, pickle on a sesame-seed roll. A parmigiana style sandwich with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce called the Italian Crispy chicken sandwich was added later.[52] The sandwich was eliminated in the US in 2000 but revived in 2007 as the Spicy Chick'n Crisp sandwich. In March 2012 the company reformulated the sandwich to the original patty and changed the spicy version to include a spicy mayo instead. The name was changed in 2013 to the Crispy Chicken Jr. and a new version called the Rodeo Crispy Chicken was added 2014.
Advertising[edit]
A 2007 advertising program for the spicy version of the Chick'n Crisp used the Whoppers, a "family" in which all the males are actors wearing a Whopper sandwich costume. In the ad spot, the parents come home and find that their son is having a party, when confronted the son blames his friend "Spicy." When the father confronts Spicy, he finds Spicy making out with the Whopper's daughter. Further ads in the program uses featured Whopper Jr. and Spicy antagonizing other fast food chains, proclaiming that Burger King has a superior value menu.

The BK Veggie is a vegetarian soy-based meatless sandwich that is served at Burger King restaurants. The sandwich is not vegan, as it has dairy components, and is one of BK's health conscious oriented menu items. The BK Veggie is made with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and onions, and is served on a sesame-seed bun. The patty is supplied by Morningstar Farms.[53] In Canada, the sandwich is prepared without mayo, while the patty is flame-broiled instead of being microwaved.
History[edit]
The product was first introduced in 2002, shortly before the company's acquisition by TPG Capital, as part of a menu expansion that included a revamped King Supreme and other products designed to better compete with a similar planned menu expansion at McDonald's early the next year.[17] It was originally prepared in the same manner as a Whopper, a flame-broiled veggie patty with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion and ketchup served on a sesame-seed roll. However, unlike the Whopper, which features regular mayonnaise, a separate low-fat mayonnaise was utilized. Currently, the BK Veggie is prepared with regular mayonnaise. At the time the sandwich was vegan if the customer asked to have it cooked in a microwave oven, otherwise it was not considered vegan because it was cooked on the same equipment as the burgers and chicken.[54] At the time of its introduction, the sandwich was hailed by many as a way to not only give vegetarians more options, but as a healthy alternative that gave all consumers more choices in meal options. The Center for Science in the Public Interest lauded the sandwich's low fat content, but derided the company's other menu items introduced at the time as being unhealthy.[55] In 2005, CSPI observed, "too bad you can’t order it with less than 930 mg of sodium," which, while an increase from the 760 or 730 mg in the sandwich in 2002, was still less than the 1100 mg in the sandwich today [June 2010].
In late 2004, BK (US) entered into a partnership with Kellogg's Morningstar Farms division to offer a soy-based meatless patty. The sandwich was reformulated not to include pickles and onions, and in order to address concerns raised by vegetarian groups, the cooking method was also changed to microwaving to prevent cross-contamination with meat products.[54][dead link][56]
Classification[edit]
In UK outlets of Burger King, the BK Veggie was approved by the Vegetarian Society. Subsequently, on the menu boards, a 'Vege society approved' logo was shown next to the item name. The UK burger is also vegan when ordered without mayonnaise or cheese.[57] In the US the sandwich was approved by PETA, who not only welcomed the BK Veggie as a way to give vegetarians more choice, but also hailed the company's recent agreement with the group to seek out suppliers that employ humane treatment methods in raising their animal stock.[58][59]
However, Burger King in the US publishes a disclaimer which states: "Burger King Corporation makes no claim that the BK Veggie Burger or any other of its products meets the requirements of a vegan or vegetarian diet. The patty is cooked in the microwave."[60]
Advertising[edit]
The use of a corporate cross-promotion helped drive sales by giving the Morningstar Farms brand increased exposure and sales opportunities, while Burger King promotes an existing, trusted brand name which aids marketing efforts and encourages consumers to try the BK Veggie.[61]
Naming and trademarks[edit]
The name BK Veggie is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in the US and Canada.

Other[edit]
Breakfast sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King breakfast sandwiches
International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of breakfast sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1978. The Croissan'wich was the first major breakfast sandwich product introduced by the company.
The company sells slightly different versions of breakfast sandwich between international markets, using local breakfast traditions and tastes to cater to those regions. To promote continuing interest in the company's breakfast products, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its breakfast sandwiches that have different ingredients from standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major offerings, breakfast sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.
Yumbo[edit]
Yumbo is a ham and cheese sandwich original introduced by Burger King in 1968 and continued on the menu until 1974. In December 2014, it was announced that the sandwich would return to the menu for a limited time starting December 2.[65][66] The Yumbo is a hot ham and cheese made with Black Forest ham, American cheese, mayonnaise and lettuce on the sub roll used for the Original Chicken Sandwich. This differs from the original sandwich that was served on a hamburger roll with no toppings.[66]
Hotdogs[edit]
In February 2016, Burger King introduced hotdogs as a permanent, full-time menu item in Its American and Canadian markets. The hotdogs market under the name grilled dogs, are made from 100% beef and came in two varieties— Chili dogs and Chicago-style.
The training videos for the product quickly became an Internet meme when it was revealed that they were hosted by Snoop Dogg and a Charro. The videos were quickly leaked to YouTube, and received media attention.
Summer 2010 Ribs LTO[edit]
In the summer of 2010, Burger King took the unusual step of adding St. Louis-style pork ribs to its summer-time menu. The ribs, 3" long, bone-in ribs, sold for about $8 order and were extremely successful. The company were sold out of the ribs just over eight weeks into the ten-week run. The company began running out of its packaging halfway into the promotion.[67][68]
The company's new broiling units were one of the key pieces in the success of the product; the new flexible batch broilers were able to be cook the ribs in a relatively short period.[67]
The advertising campaign was produced by Crispin, Porter + Boguski and featured flying pigs convincing customers that a fast food restaurant could in fact produce good barbecue ribs at a reasonable price.[68]
Summer BBQ LTO programs[edit]
The summer of 2012 saw the introduction of series of limited-time, summer-oriented products. Included in the new menu were a pulled pork sandwich and variations on its Whopper and TenderCrisp chicken sandwiches; each of these new products are based on regional barbecue styles from Tennessee, the Carolinas and Texas. Rounding out the products are an ice cream sundae topped with bacon, sweet potato fries, and frozen lemonade.[69] The products are part of Burger King's ownership group plans to reverse sagging sales and diminished market share. Additionally, the new products were designed to ward off increased competition across the fast food burger restaurant industry from chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger.[70]
The Summertime BBQ menu returned in 2013, with the pulled pork sandwich, the Carolina BBQ sandwiches variants be continued. In place of the Texas BBQ sandwich variants and bacon sundae was a new BBQ rib sandwich and a series of desserts and milkshakes based on Oreo cookie products from Mondelēz International.
Cheetos Chicken Fries[edit]
On September 14, 2016, Burger King Cheetos Chicken Fries became available at participating restaurants.[71]
Whopperito[edit]
The Whopperito was a Burger King menu item that was introduced in 2016. It consists of most of the ingredients of the Whopper wrapped inside a tortilla. Instead of the ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard, the Whopperito contains queso sauce.[72] Burger King originally introduced it only at several of their Pennsylvania locations in June; on August 15, they began selling it nationwide.[73] Leslie Patton of Bloomberg News speculated that the Whopperito represented an attempt by Burger King to compete with Chipotle Mexican Grill.[74]

Burger King cheeseburgers


When the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1955, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper. The company did not add another permanent hamburger to its menu until the introduction of the Big King sandwich in 1996 in response to McDonald's Big Mac sandwich. The company began experimenting with premium hamburgers, made from higher quality ingredients, in 1978 with the introduction of its Specialty Sandwich product line. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. However, it wasn't until 2002 when the company began to work on a premium burger in earnest. On the value side, Burger King first started offering sliders to its menu in the mid-1980s and offered them off and on for the next twenty years.
The company's first major chicken product, its Original Chicken Sandwich, was also part of the company's 1978 Specialty Sandwich line. BK Chicken Tenders made their debut in a menu revision and expansion in 1985 to address the absence of a chicken fingers product akin to McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The company began offering the first, nationally available grilled chicken sandwich product when it added the BK Broiler in the early 1990s. That sandwich would go on to be reformulated and renamed several times before settling on the current TenderGrill sandwich. The chain added a second chicken finger product with the introduction of its BK Chicken Fries product in the mid-2000s. BK Chicken fries would also be removed and re-added to its menu in response to ownership changes and customer demand.
The company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu was another addition that came in with the company's in a 1978 menu expansion. Initially a clone of McDonald's breakfast line, the company began to differentiate itself with the introduction of the Crosan'wich breakfast sandwich in 1982.

A Whopper sandwich


The Whopper sandwich is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's. Introduced in 1957, it has undergone several reformulations including re-sizing and bread changes. The burger is one of the best known products in the fast food industry; it is so well known that Burger King bills itself as the Home of the Whopper in its advertising and signage. Additionally, the company uses the name in its high-end concept, the BK Whopper Bar. Due to its place in the marketplace, the Whopper has prompted Burger King's competitors, mainly McDonald's with at least six different products and Wendy's with its Big Classic, to try to develop similar products designed to compete with it.[1][2][3][4][5]
The company markets several variants of the burger, such as the Whopper Jr.,[6] as well as other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business, such as the teriyaki Whopper in Japan or the LTO Canadian Whopper.[7][8][9] With the company's expansion into India, the chain introduced two new variants on the Whopper while reintroducing the chicken version of the sandwich. To accommodate practitioners of Islam and Hinduism, who make up the majority of the Indian population, the chain has eliminated beef and pork from its menu. In their place, the chain is using a combination of chicken, vegetarian patties and mutton in place of beef.[10]
To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time offerings ("LTO") on the Whopper such as the Windows 7 Whopper in Japan as a product tie-in with Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system. The hamburger contained seven stacked beef patties and measured 5 in (13 cm) high, weighed almost 2.2 lb (1.00 kg), and had more than 1,000 kcal (4,200 kJ). It was originally planned to be available for only seven days starting on 22 October 2009.[11] Due to its success in selling 6,000 sandwiches within the first four days, Burger King decided to extend the promotion period an extra nine days, ending on 6 November.[11][12]
As the signature product of the company, it is often at the center of advertising promotions, product tie-ins, and even corporate practical jokes and hoaxes such as its 1998 April Fool's Day prank where Burger King took out a full page advertisement in several national publications, such as USA Today, promoting a new version of the sandwich called the "Left-Handed Whopper". The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180° to accommodate southpaws.[13] Some of the early twenty-first century advertising programs, particularly in Europe, have drawn criticism for cultural insensitivity or misogyny. One such example was The Texican Whopper, an LTO version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a lucha libre wrestler.[14] The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans. Additionally, the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape that appeared to be a Mexican flag, a violation of Mexican laws governing the usage of its national banner.[15] Additionally, as the signature product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product. Specifically, the name "Whopper" is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in all markets it is sold.[Notes 1]

Big King[edit]
Main article: Big King




The European version of the Big King sandwich


The Big King sandwich is one of the major hamburger products sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King, and has been part of its menu for more than twenty years. During its testing phase in 1996-1997, it was originally called the Double Supreme and was configured similarly to the McDonald's Big Mac—including a three piece roll.[16] It was later reformulated as a more standard double burger during the latter part of product testing in 1997. It was given its current name when the product was formally introduced in September 1997, but maintained the more conventional double cheeseburger format.[17] Its introduction capped a period of sales success for Burger King, where the company successfully took on its rival McDonald's.[18] The product was renamed King Supreme in 2001 when it was slightly reformulated as part of a menu restructuring during a period of corporate decline for the company in which its corporate parent, Diageo, was trying to sell the company.[17] When a TPG Capital-led team of investors took over the company in 2002, the new management team again restructured the menu, eliminating the King Supreme in favor of its new BK Stacker line of sandwiches. The sandwiches were part of a line of controversial sandwiches high in fat and calories which several groups protested.[19][20][21] A limited time offering (LTO) sandwich line known as BK Toppers accompanied the Stacker line briefly in 2012, including one sandwich known as the Deluxe topper — a virtual clone of the Big King in its formulation.[22] The Stacker and Topper lines were discontinued in the United States shortly after, and the Big King returned to said market in November 2013 as a permanent product after the company was again sold, this time to 3G Capital of Brazil.[23][24]
Despite being off the menu in the United States for several years, the product was still sold in several other countries under several names during the interim of its unavailability in the United States.[25][26] One such example sold by BK's European arm of the company is a larger version of the sandwich called the Big King XXL, based on the company's Whopper sandwich. The Big King XXL is part of a line of larger double cheeseburgers known as the BK XXL line; the XXL line was the center of controversy over product health standards and advertising in Spain when first introduced.[27] There is also a chicken variant of the sandwich in the United States and Canada.[28] To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time variants on the Big King.[29] Being one of the company's major offerings, the Big King sandwich is sometimes at the center of advertising promotions and product tie-ins.[30] Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 2]

Premium burgers[edit]
Main article: Burger King premium burgers




The Steakhouse XT sandwich


As far back as the 1970s, international fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.
The chain's first major attempt was part of their Specialty Sandwich line that was introduced in 1979 was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. After the failure of the Specialty Sandwich line, Burger King went on to introduce several other premium burgers made from a variety of meats. One major example introduced in 2002 was the BK Back Porch Griller sandwich line. The sandwich, introduced in May 2002 was a pronounced failure, and pulled in September of that year. The next product Burger King introduced was its Angus Steakburger which it began selling in 2004; it too had lack-luster sales due in part to the patty being par cooked. The sandwich was later reformulated as the Steakhouse Burger which used a thinner, flatter, fresh cooked patty. The Steakhouse Burger sandwich was eventually replaced with the Steakhouse XT/Angus XT burger, which used a new, thicker round patty among several other changes. This newer sandwich was made possible with the introduction of the company's new broiler systems which allowed varying cooking times and temperatures which in turn gave the company the ability to utilize fresh cooked, thicker patties in its sandwiches. Only variations of the sandwich that explicitly state "Angus" in the title are manufactured from meat from Angus cattle. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America.
Internationally, the chain has introduced several lines of premium sandwiches. In New Zealand, the chain first introduced the BK Crown Jewels line which was based upon the Whopper, TenderGrill, and TenderCrisp sandwiches. The line was eventually replaced with the BK King's Collection menu of Angus-based sandwiches. It also sold Angus-burgers in Australia, Great Britain and Ireland. In East Asia, the chains sells the Angus XT sandwich which is a variant of the Steakhouse XT. In Great Britain, the chain has also introduced a burger based on lamb and another based on Wagyu beef, while back in the United States it sold a turkey burger sandwich - all of which were limited time offerings (LTOs).
To promote continuing interest in these products, Burger King occasionally released limited-time (LTO) variants on its premium burgers that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major business strategies, these sandwiches have sometimes been the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product group within the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.[Notes 3]

Sliders[edit]
Main article: Burger King sliders




An order of BK Burger Shots


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King has sold a variety of sliders, or mini-sandwiches, since the 1980s. Burger Bundles was the first iteration, a set of three small hamburgers or cheeseburgers. These sandwiches were eventually replaced with a reformulated product called Burger Buddies that was sold in pairs. After a change in management in 2004, Burger Buddies were re-released as BK Burger Shots. The company has also sold several chicken and breakfast sandwich versions of these products.
During the periods these products were sold, they were often the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major products in the company's portfolio, Burger King had registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the products, most of which have since lapsed.[Notes 4]

BK Stackers[edit]
Main article: BK Stacker




A BK Stacker sandwich


The BK Stacker sandwiches were a family of hamburgers featuring the same toppings that targets the late-teen–to–young-adult and male-oriented demographic groups.[31][32][33] It is a cheeseburger consisting of anywhere from one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) grilled beef patties, American cheese, bacon and Stacker sauce served on a sesame seed bun.
History[edit]
The BK Stacker was first introduced in the summer of 2006.[31] The chain garnered media attention due to the size of the sandwiches, particularly the Quad, and the large amount of calories and fat that the sandwich had (see the Enormous Omelet Sandwich breakfast sandwich.) In a November 2006 menu revision, the Double BK Stacker became a numbered Value meal item in North America, with the number varying by market area.
The Stacker line was updated in 2011. The stacker line was moved to the value menu with a reformulated ingredient list by deleting the top layer of cheese.[34] The changed pricing structure created a situation where the distribution of ingredients doesn't scale at the same rate as increasing numbers of burger patties. Two single Stackers at one dollar included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for two dollars. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker.[35]
Product description[edit]
The BK Stackers are a family of hamburgers, consisting of one to four 1.7 oz (48 g) hamburger patties, bacon, American cheese and the King Sauce used on the Big King served on a sesame-seed bun.
Advertising[edit]
The BK Stacker was introduced using commercials that employed groups of little people in the roles of members of the "Stackers Union". The characters were "Vin," played by Danny Woodburn, "the new guy," and various members of the "Stackers Union" construction team that work in a BK kitchen assembling the sandwiches. The tag line was "Meat, Cheese and Bacon- Stacked High". As exemplified in the advertising campaign, part of the sandwich's concept revolves around not having vegetables like lettuce, onions, or tomatoes.[31]

The BK Toppers line was a line of cheeseburgers introduced in October 2011 as limited time offer. The sandwiches featured a new 3.2 oz (91 g) chopped beef patty that features a coarser grind than the company's 2 oz (57 g) hamburger patty. The four sandwiches in the line were the Cheeseburger Deluxe, Mushroom and Swiss, Bacon and Cheddar, and Western BBQ. The sandwiches were a part of the new ownership's plans to expand its customer base beyond the 18- to 34-year-old demographic which it had been targeting over the previous several years.[22] The product resurrected a previous name from the BK Hot Toppers line of sandwiches from the 1980s.[36] They were removed from the menu in July 2012.
Advertising[edit]
The company used its advertising firm of McGarryBowen and a food-centric campaign to introduce the products.[22][37] The ads feature the tag line of More beef, more value, with the television commercials utilizing images of the ingredients of the sandwiches as they are being prepared.[22][38]

The Rodeo sandwiches are a line of similarly topped sandwiches targeting the value conscious demographic. They are topped with three onion rings and barbecue sauce served on a small sesame-seed bun, and can be made as a hamburger, cheeseburger or chicken sandwich.
History[edit]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was created to coincide with the release of the film Small Soldiers in 1998.[39] It originally was available as just a cheeseburger topped with Bull's Eye brand barbecue sauce and onion rings.[40]
The Rodeo Cheeseburger was nationally discontinued in the U.S., but it was regionally available in some locations as part of Burger King's value menu.[40][41] In 2007, BK switched its barbecue sauce from Bulls-Eye to Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue sauce.[42]
In 2013, the Rodeo Burger was reintroduced in the U.S. as a new line of value sandwiches with a US$1.00 price. The new base level sandwich removed the cheese from the burger and introduced chicken version of the sandwich. The cheeseburger version was still available, but with an additional cost of up to 50¢.[43][44]
Product description[edit]
The Rodeo burger is a hamburger, consisting of a 1.7 oz (48 g) beef patty, barbecue sauce and onion rings on a sesame-seed bun. A cheeseburger variant adds a slice of American cheese, while the chicken variant swaps the beef patty out with a 2 oz (57 g) fried chicken patty and extra serving of barbecue sauce.
Advertising[edit]
The Rodeo cheeseburger was advertised using a parody of the Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson film A Few Good Men. In the commercial, Chip Hazard quoted Jack Nicholson's line "you can't handle the truth" as "you can't handle the Rodeo Burger."[45]

Poultry and fish[edit]
Specialty Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King Specialty Sandwiches




The Original Chicken Sandwich, the primary product in the Specialty Sandwich line.


The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are a line of sandwiches developed by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 as part of a new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.
Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several different names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royal in the international markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the products.[Notes 5]

Grilled chicken sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King grilled chicken sandwiches




The TenderGrill chicken sandwich, Burger King's current North American grilled chicken sandwich as of November 2013.


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have introduced a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches to its products portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, and was one of the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24-36 adult males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.
The company sells slightly different versions of the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 6]


Fish Sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King fish sandwiches




An earlier version of the BK Big Fish Sandwich


International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of fish sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1975. The Whaler sandwich was the first iteration, designed to compete with rival burger-chain McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich. With the addition of the company's Specialty Sandwich line in 1978, the sandwich was reformulated as the Long Fish sandwich. With the discontinuation of the Specialty Sandwich line, the sandwich was returned to its original recipe and name. With the introduction of the company's BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990, the fish sandwich became tied to the development cycle of the broiled chicken sandwich and was again reformulated and renamed as the Ocean Catch Fish fillet. When the broiled chicken sandwich underwent another reformulation in 2002, the fish sandwich was also redone and renamed as the BK Big Fish sandwich. By 2015, the sandwich had undergone several more modifications and went through a series of names including the BK Fish and Premium Alaskan fish sandwich. It is currently sold as the BK Big Fish sandwich in the United States and Canada. Internationally the fish sandwich is also known as the BK Fish, BK Fish'n Crisp burger and Fish Royale in those markets.
The company markets very few variants of the fish sandwiches, but it does offer localized versions that are specifically tailored to meet taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. Usually during the Christian religious period known as Lent, Burger King releases limited-time (LTO) variants on the sandwich that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. While the sandwich itself never has never been at the center of controversy, the sourcing of fish from Icelandic suppliers lead to a call for a boycott of Burger King because of Iceland's participation in whaling - despite a 1982 international moratorium on the practice. Despite being one of the company's major offerings, the fish sandwich is rarely the center of product advertising for the company. As a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 7]

BK Chicken Fries[edit]
Main article: BK Chicken Fries




An order of BK Chicken Fries.


BK Chicken Fries are a fried chicken product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At the time of their introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.
As one of the company's major offerings, the chicken fries are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the extreme metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product been a prominent part of the menu for the better part of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product - its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.[Notes 8]

The turkey burger was introduced in 2013 as part of a spring-time limited time offering promotion called Festival of Burgers.[46] The new sandwich was part of a series of new, updated or modified sandwiches and along with a revamped veggie burger, as a newer more healthier offering than its beef-based burgers. With the introduction of the sandwich, the chain became the largest restaurant chain to offer a turkey burger as part of its menu.[46] Despite being declared a healthier option, the sandwich still weighed in at 10 oz (280 g) and 25% of a person's daily nutritional intake by the USDA standards.[47] Despite its size, the sandwich was one of the chain’s more healthful options, approximately 50 calories more than its TenderGrill chicken sandwich giving the chain three lower-calorie non-burger options.[48]
The new burger was part of a second wave of menu restructuring that included a stuffed bacon and cheddar burger, variations on the Whopper and a new coffee line that was co-branded with Seattle's Best Coffee.[49]
The chain also moved its advertising account from McGarryBowen to new agency of record Mother in February. The agency, who had already been working with the chain for several months as a secondary ad firm, introduced a new "people-centric" advertising program for the new sandwich line-up.[50]

The Crispy Chicken Jr. is a small fried chicken sandwich that consists of a chicken patty, lettuce and mayonnaise served on a sesame seed bun. It is one of the company's value oriented products. Originally introduced in the late 1990s as the Chick'n Crisp sandwich, the name was changed in 2013. The company has released several variants on the original sandwich.
History[edit]
The sandwich was introduced in 1998 as part of a menu expansion that added a value menu which the company dubbed the Great Tastes Menu.[51] Originally the sandwich was made with a 3 oz (85 g) chicken patty, mayonnaise, pickle on a sesame-seed roll. A parmigiana style sandwich with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce called the Italian Crispy chicken sandwich was added later.[52] The sandwich was eliminated in the US in 2000 but revived in 2007 as the Spicy Chick'n Crisp sandwich. In March 2012 the company reformulated the sandwich to the original patty and changed the spicy version to include a spicy mayo instead. The name was changed in 2013 to the Crispy Chicken Jr. and a new version called the Rodeo Crispy Chicken was added 2014.
Advertising[edit]
A 2007 advertising program for the spicy version of the Chick'n Crisp used the Whoppers, a "family" in which all the males are actors wearing a Whopper sandwich costume. In the ad spot, the parents come home and find that their son is having a party, when confronted the son blames his friend "Spicy." When the father confronts Spicy, he finds Spicy making out with the Whopper's daughter. Further ads in the program uses featured Whopper Jr. and Spicy antagonizing other fast food chains, proclaiming that Burger King has a superior value menu.

The BK Veggie is a vegetarian soy-based meatless sandwich that is served at Burger King restaurants. The sandwich is not vegan, as it has dairy components, and is one of BK's health conscious oriented menu items. The BK Veggie is made with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and onions, and is served on a sesame-seed bun. The patty is supplied by Morningstar Farms.[53] In Canada, the sandwich is prepared without mayo, while the patty is flame-broiled instead of being microwaved.
History[edit]
The product was first introduced in 2002, shortly before the company's acquisition by TPG Capital, as part of a menu expansion that included a revamped King Supreme and other products designed to better compete with a similar planned menu expansion at McDonald's early the next year.[17] It was originally prepared in the same manner as a Whopper, a flame-broiled veggie patty with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion and ketchup served on a sesame-seed roll. However, unlike the Whopper, which features regular mayonnaise, a separate low-fat mayonnaise was utilized. Currently, the BK Veggie is prepared with regular mayonnaise. At the time the sandwich was vegan if the customer asked to have it cooked in a microwave oven, otherwise it was not considered vegan because it was cooked on the same equipment as the burgers and chicken.[54] At the time of its introduction, the sandwich was hailed by many as a way to not only give vegetarians more options, but as a healthy alternative that gave all consumers more choices in meal options. The Center for Science in the Public Interest lauded the sandwich's low fat content, but derided the company's other menu items introduced at the time as being unhealthy.[55] In 2005, CSPI observed, "too bad you can’t order it with less than 930 mg of sodium," which, while an increase from the 760 or 730 mg in the sandwich in 2002, was still less than the 1100 mg in the sandwich today [June 2010].
In late 2004, BK (US) entered into a partnership with Kellogg's Morningstar Farms division to offer a soy-based meatless patty. The sandwich was reformulated not to include pickles and onions, and in order to address concerns raised by vegetarian groups, the cooking method was also changed to microwaving to prevent cross-contamination with meat products.[54][dead link][56]
Classification[edit]
In UK outlets of Burger King, the BK Veggie was approved by the Vegetarian Society. Subsequently, on the menu boards, a 'Vege society approved' logo was shown next to the item name. The UK burger is also vegan when ordered without mayonnaise or cheese.[57] In the US the sandwich was approved by PETA, who not only welcomed the BK Veggie as a way to give vegetarians more choice, but also hailed the company's recent agreement with the group to seek out suppliers that employ humane treatment methods in raising their animal stock.[58][59]
However, Burger King in the US publishes a disclaimer which states: "Burger King Corporation makes no claim that the BK Veggie Burger or any other of its products meets the requirements of a vegan or vegetarian diet. The patty is cooked in the microwave."[60]
Advertising[edit]
The use of a corporate cross-promotion helped drive sales by giving the Morningstar Farms brand increased exposure and sales opportunities, while Burger King promotes an existing, trusted brand name which aids marketing efforts and encourages consumers to try the BK Veggie.[61]
Naming and trademarks[edit]
The name BK Veggie is a registered trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the "circle-R" (®) symbol in the US and Canada.

Other[edit]
Breakfast sandwiches[edit]
Main article: Burger King breakfast sandwiches
International fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of breakfast sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1978. The Croissan'wich was the first major breakfast sandwich product introduced by the company.
The company sells slightly different versions of breakfast sandwich between international markets, using local breakfast traditions and tastes to cater to those regions. To promote continuing interest in the company's breakfast products, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its breakfast sandwiches that have different ingredients from standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major offerings, breakfast sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.
Yumbo[edit]
Yumbo is a ham and cheese sandwich original introduced by Burger King in 1968 and continued on the menu until 1974. In December 2014, it was announced that the sandwich would return to the menu for a limited time starting December 2.[65][66] The Yumbo is a hot ham and cheese made with Black Forest ham, American cheese, mayonnaise and lettuce on the sub roll used for the Original Chicken Sandwich. This differs from the original sandwich that was served on a hamburger roll with no toppings.[66]
Hotdogs[edit]
In February 2016, Burger King introduced hotdogs as a permanent, full-time menu item in Its American and Canadian markets. The hotdogs market under the name grilled dogs, are made from 100% beef and came in two varieties— Chili dogs and Chicago-style.
The training videos for the product quickly became an Internet meme when it was revealed that they were hosted by Snoop Dogg and a Charro. The videos were quickly leaked to YouTube, and received media attention.
Summer 2010 Ribs LTO[edit]
In the summer of 2010, Burger King took the unusual step of adding St. Louis-style pork ribs to its summer-time menu. The ribs, 3" long, bone-in ribs, sold for about $8 order and were extremely successful. The company were sold out of the ribs just over eight weeks into the ten-week run. The company began running out of its packaging halfway into the promotion.[67][68]
The company's new broiling units were one of the key pieces in the success of the product; the new flexible batch broilers were able to be cook the ribs in a relatively short period.[67]
The advertising campaign was produced by Crispin, Porter + Boguski and featured flying pigs convincing customers that a fast food restaurant could in fact produce good barbecue ribs at a reasonable price.[68]
Summer BBQ LTO programs[edit]
The summer of 2012 saw the introduction of series of limited-time, summer-oriented products. Included in the new menu were a pulled pork sandwich and variations on its Whopper and TenderCrisp chicken sandwiches; each of these new products are based on regional barbecue styles from Tennessee, the Carolinas and Texas. Rounding out the products are an ice cream sundae topped with bacon, sweet potato fries, and frozen lemonade.[69] The products are part of Burger King's ownership group plans to reverse sagging sales and diminished market share. Additionally, the new products were designed to ward off increased competition across the fast food burger restaurant industry from chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger.[70]
The Summertime BBQ menu returned in 2013, with the pulled pork sandwich, the Carolina BBQ sandwiches variants be continued. In place of the Texas BBQ sandwich variants and bacon sundae was a new BBQ rib sandwich and a series of desserts and milkshakes based on Oreo cookie products from Mondelēz International.
Cheetos Chicken Fries[edit]
On September 14, 2016, Burger King Cheetos Chicken Fries became available at participating restaurants.[71]
Whopperito[edit]
The Whopperito was a Burger King menu item that was introduced in 2016. It consists of most of the ingredients of the Whopper wrapped inside a tortilla. Instead of the ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard, the Whopperito contains queso sauce.[72] Burger King originally introduced it only at several of their Pennsylvania locations in June; on August 15, they began selling it nationwide.[73] Leslie Patton of Bloomberg News speculated that the Whopperito represented an attempt by Burger King to compete with Chipotle Mexican Grill.[74]

        Wonderful bed with tons of storage
I love this bed so much I bought it a second time when I moved. The drawers are HUGE and hold so much. I also love the way it looks. The first time I bought it, building it was no problem and everything was perfect. The second time, we had some issues putting together one section (finally it worked) and still have one drawer that doesn't slide properly. So I guess that part varies. Putting it together is a ton of work, but I think it's worth it for this bed. The only thing is, even with the drawers taken out, it's SUPER heavy. If you're planning to move yourself, it might not be the best bed to get. If you hire movers, I'm sure it's okay.

        Had for 5 years and still love it!
I live in a city and storage is king. This has added an entire closet to my bedroom. We've packed the drawers full with heavy stuff and have had no problems what so ever. We've also found that behind the drawers there is a little more hidden space if you are willing to lift the mattress and slats to get to it. We bought the cheapest slats first and that was a mistake. Once we upgraded it was amazing. Moving it is a pain. You have to disassmeble everything. Once assembled thats it, its in, no moving it around. 

We are going to upgrade to a king and buy this again. I've researched other options but this has the most storage and simplest design. We were even willing to pay a couple 1,000 for an upgraded version but non were exactly what we wanted or didn't have the same enormous storage. Highly recommend.

        DO NOT BUY THIS BED
Whatever you do--DO NOT BUY THIS BED. An absolute nightmare to put together. Came with missing pieces and screws that were already worn to the point that they could not even be fully screwed in. Given the wrong pieces for drawer assembly but even if the drawers parts were given to me correctly I would not be able to use the drawers as the loose screws prevented the wheel axles from properly working. Tried calling Ikea customer service and they were utterly clueless and of no help. Got transferred multiple times for no apparent reason and each representative seemed incredibly annoyed to even have to deal with my issues.

        A lot of storage space
We purchased this bed 3 years ago for the added storage space.  It is has been a good bed frame.  My only compliant is that there is nothing covering the top of the drawers under/around the mattress, so you have to keep your linens or whatever you store in the drawer in a zipper bag to protect it from the dirt and dust that falls into the drawer around the edge of the mattress.

        Love it!
We purchased this bed a couple years ago.  We put an older mattress on the frame and it felt like new again!  The storage drawers are FANTASTIC......Lots of space!  I love this frame so much I bought my 2nd one 6 months ago......and I'm going to purchase my 3rd today!

        Never try to move it
Comfortable and spacious at first but if you ever try to move with without disassembling it breaks with the slightest motion. Then if you try to get replacement parts, there is no place to buy them on Ikea's website. So after you move it, it's trashed.

        Do Not Buy!!
While the storage is nice on the bed that is the only positive. Drawer handles stick out so you cut your legs when you get out of bed, same goes for the corners. The drawers didn't stay aligned long and became difficult to open and close. Difficult to assemble and all the boxes are super heavy and awkward. Save your money!! Seriously

Lots of room for storage and was easy to move around even after assembly.

Burger King is unveiling a horrible, genius, infuriating, hilarious, and maybe very poorly thought-out ad today that’s designed to intentionally set off Google Homes and Android phones.
The 15-second ad features someone in a Burger King uniform leaning into the camera before saying, “OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?”
For anyone with a Google Home near their TV, that strangely phrased request will prompt the speaker to begin reading the Wikipedia entry for the Whopper. It’s a clever way of getting viewers’ attention, but it’s also a really quick way of getting on viewers’ nerves — just look at the reactions people had when ads accidentally triggered voice assistants in the past.
Burger King’s ad relies on Wikipedia, which is maybe not a good idea
While Burger King is far from the first to recognize that it’s possible to mess with someone else’s smart speaker, it’s certainly the first to put it into a widely run ad campaign. The spot is supposed to begin running in prime-time slots across the US today on networks including History, Spike, Comedy Central, MTV, E!, and Bravo, and it will air during Adult Swim, The Tonight Show, and Jimmy Kimmel Live.
Google wasn’t involved in the ad’s creation. That means this isn’t an expansion of Google’s ad tests (people weren’t happy when Google built a Beauty and the Beast ad into the speaker), but it also leads to some real issues for Burger King. For one, it has to use weird phrasing — “What is the Whopper burger?” — because that’s the query that actually gets the result it wants. Asking “What is a Whopper?” gets you the definition of the word “whopper.”
And then there’s the bigger problem: Google gets its explanation of the Whopper from Wikipedia. And as we all know, anyone’s free to edit Wikipedia.
It actually looks like Burger King went and edited the Whopper entry ahead of this ad being run. For almost a decade, Wikipedia’s page for the Whopper began with more or less the same sentence: “The Whopper sandwich is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's.”
Burger King’s marketing chief seems to have edited Wikipedia to improve the ad
But last week, that first line — the only line that Google Home reads — was changed to: “The Whopper is a burger, consisting of a flame-grilled patty made with 100 percent beef with no preservatives or fillers, topped with sliced tomatoes, onions, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, and mayonnaise, served on a sesame-seed bun.” That certainly sounds like ad copy.
And all evidence suggests Burger King is behind the edit. The line was first added by someone with the username “Fermachado123,” which appears to be the username of Burger King’s marketing chief, Fernando Machado. He uses the same name on Instagram and an almost identical name on Twitter.
A press representative for the company stopped responding when asked about the edit. Wikipedia specifically asks that editors “avoid shameless self-promotion” while making changes, and this very much seems to break the rule.
Relying on Wikipedia also opens up one other problem: anyone can edit it. The Verge modified the Whopper entry briefly, and Google Home began speaking the updated text only minutes later.
Smart speakers keep getting triggered by accident
With this ad airing nationally, Burger King is opening the door for an editing war — and it risks having a malicious editor make the Google Home say something inappropriate when explaining the Whopper.
Those risks will certainly make for an interesting, if frustrating, ad campaign.
Burger King is taking advantage of something here that’s been happening for months: commercials, news anchors, and other voices on TV keep triggering the Google Home, and Amazon’s Alexa, by accident. (“OK Google” could trigger some Android phones, too, though Android has an option to only respond to a specific voice.) In one instance, a news report led to Alexas ordering dollhouses.
The whole thing seems avoidable, but so far, Google and Amazon haven’t added voice-recognition to their smart speakers. Until that changes, these accidents are going to keep happening — and other advertisers willing to risk annoying you may see an opportunity.
Update April 12th, 3:35PM ET: Google appears to have intervened and stopped the Home from responding to Burger King’s commercial. The Whopper’s Wikipedia page has also been reverted to its pre-ad state, and the page has been locked amid an editing war.

Concrete
What is Concrete and how is it placed?Concrete is a mixture of two components: aggregates and paste. The aggregate component is normally composed of sand and gravel or crushed stone. The paste component is normally comprised of cement, water and admixtures. 
Concrete is usually placed using either the form-and-pour or form-and-pump method. Both methods usually involve the design and construction of formwork around the repair section (or new construction application), in order to shape the final grade of the concrete section to be placed. Placing concrete into a horizontal concrete repair section would be the exception, wherein formwork is generally not required.

Grout
What are the various types of Grout and where are they used?Grout is a mixture of water, cement, admixtures and sometimes fine aggregate. It is used for placement into narrow cavities such as rock fissures or holes, to fill and consolidate two adjoining objects into a solid mass.

Grout is typically categorized as either a sanded grout or a neat grout. As the name implies, a sanded grout contains cement, sand, admixtures and water, while a neat grout contains cement, admixtures and water. Sanded grouts are normally used for general void filling and neat grouts are normally used for grouting around piles, cables and post-tensioning tendons.

Repair Mortar
What is Repair Mortar and what are its applications?A repair mortar is a patching material composed of cement, fine aggregates and admixtures. It is used to repair concrete or masonry surfaces. Repair mortars are best suited for shallow concrete repairs (those less than 1.5-2 inches or 38-50 mm). Typical applications include the repair of honeycombs, bug holes, tie-rod holes or any other small concrete section.

ChemGrout Equipment
What type of equipment does ChemGrout offer?The ChemGrout brand offers a large and varying line of grout mixers and pumps to suit your specialized grouting application. From low profile, manual grout pumps that can be carried by hand, to large trailer and skid-mounted, colloidal mixers and agitators, ChemGrout offers a diverse line of grouting equipment designed to meet the demands of every application.

Fiori Equipment
What type of equipment does Fiori offer? For the last 70 years, The Fiori Group, with headquarters in Finale Emilia, Italy, has designed, developed and manufactured off-road, concrete batching vehicles and dumpers for the construction industry. This company has the capability to find the most effective solution for making and transporting concrete on-site, with great flexibility, minimization of energy costs and reduction of environmental impact.

King Equipment
What type of equipment does KING offer?Under the KING Shotcrete Solutions name, KING offers equipment for applications such as a large volume, high-production concrete pours, where ready-mix is not feasible or available. Machinery such as continuous mixers are designed for use with pre-blended, “just add water” concrete mix that is supplied in bags or by silo.

				Why Burger King’s Google Home Activation For The Whopper Worked			

				"For us, the worst thing that can happen is not to get noticed," says Fernando Machado, Head of Brand Marketing, Burger King. 			



By David Kaplan
Jul 19, 2017 1:05PM



 


Last April, an ad campaign promoting Burger King’s Whopper set off Google Home devices by asking its personal digital assistant what the quick serve restaurant chain’s signature product was.
Within hours, Google “blocked” devices from recognizing the question.
While it seemed as if the campaign were cut short, Fernando Machado, Head of Brand Marketing at Burger King, said that the effort, which was created by the chain’s creative partner, DAVID The Agency, was deemed a clear success.
Burger King’s Fernando Machado speaking at Tuesday’s Ad Club
“We just went for it,” said Machado, who was honored as “marketer of the year “at the Advertising Club of NY’s Ad People 2017 event on Tuesday.
“We are always looking for innovative ways to get people to talk about our brand and our products,”Machado said. “When David The Agency came up with the idea to promote the Whopper, our most iconic product, we knew from the beginning it would get people talking and would be topical.”
Miami-based Burger King, which runs about 7,000 outlets in the U.S., engaged in one of the first ads directed at a voice-activated assistant by taking its message right to Google Home, the search giant’s voice-activated digital assistant that it unveiled last fall. The device is prompted by the phrase, “Okay, Google.”
In the spot (a 15-second YouTube version is here), a Burger King cashier addresses the audience saying that there’s too many “delicious ingredients” in the Whopper to list in a short commercial. So, instead, the cashier leans in to the camera and says, “But I’ve got an idea: Okay, Google, what is the Whopper Burger?”
Even though Google prevented its devices from responding to the prompt, the ad got more than 10 billion impressions around the globe, with the U.S. leading the charge, Machado said.
“Personal digital assistants is much bigger here than in other markets. But it got talkability everywhere,” Machado told GeoMarketing. “Sometimes, this kind of idea is bigger than you expect, sometimes not. You can’t predict it. The important thing for us is just to do it and see what happens. What’s the worst that can happen? For us, the worst thing that can happen is not to get noticed. And this campaign certainly got noticed.”
Anselmo Ramos, founder and chief creative officer of Miami’s DAVID The Agency, said that the spot was indicative of Burger King’s irreverent, try-anything spirit.
“Hey, what if for the first time, we do a commercial that activates the Google Home device on purpose,” Ramos said after a humorously “roasting” Machado at the Ad Club event. “That would be a first. We don’t know the limits of technology. Will some people be okay with this kind of interaction? Some people might hate it. Some people might love it. But we won’t know anything if we don’t try it. And by that alone, we succeeded.”
Anselmo Ramos, DAVID The Agency, “roasts” Ad Club Marketer of The Year honoree Fernando Machado of Burger King.
The experimentation with Google Home’s ability to “listen” to prompts reflects wider changes coming from voice-activation.
A report from Forrester this past spring warned that it was high time for CMOs to face the facts that digital advertising has not worked when it comes to engaging consumers and that the emerging role of voice-activated digital assistants and the connected intelligence that powers the devices by Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft will lead to only further breakdown of traditional marketing models.
The report, The End Of Advertising As We Know It? by Forrester analysts James McQuivey and Keith Johnston, posits a “great unraveling” of advertising that’s coming with the new models taking as much as $2.9 billion away from display advertising in the next year.
Neither Machado or Ramos expressed any concern about the role of voice-activation and connected home devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home.
“Is this the end of advertising? I don’t think so,” Machado said. “New technology has always opened doors for advertising. This represented a creative way to get the message out, a new way to reach our target audience, to reach our fans. That’s how we see technology: a chance to develop bigger idea that can be deployed across different channels.”
This kind of work takes us back to the Mad Men days a little – without the drinking, at least, Ramos added.
“When you look at radio, everybody understands how to write a spot that hits all the emotional spots,” Ramos said. “With Google Home, no one knows. It’s no territory. So we need to guess and learn. Luckily, we have a great client in Burger King that is willing to embrace new ideas, new technology.”

Neither Machado or Ramos expressed any concern about the role of voice-activation and connected home devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home.
“Is this the end of advertising? I don’t think so,” Machado said. “New technology has always opened doors for advertising. This represented a creative way to get the message out, a new way to reach our target audience, to reach our fans. That’s how we see technology: a chance to develop bigger idea that can be deployed across different channels.”
This kind of work takes us back to the Mad Men days a little – without the drinking, at least, Ramos added.
“When you look at radio, everybody understands how to write a spot that hits all the emotional spots,” Ramos said. “With Google Home, no one knows. It’s no territory. So we need to guess and learn. Luckily, we have a great client in Burger King that is willing to embrace new ideas, new technology.”
