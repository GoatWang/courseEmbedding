Women entrepreneurs have a harder time raising money than men. The gender gap extends to bank lending, and in Silicon Valley men have the power and the purse strings. 
As a result, more female founders are taking funding matters into their own hands. Women founders who use seed crowdfunding platforms aren't just reaching their funding goals, they are doing so at a rate that's better than crowdfunded ventures started by men. Across 450,000 seed crowdfunding campaigns recently studied by PwC and The Crowdfunding Centre, women-led campaigns reached their funding goal more often than male-led campaigns.
In the United States and U.K. — the largest markets for seed crowdfunding campaigns — 20 percent of male-led campaigns met their goal compared with 24 percent and 26 percent of female-led campaigns, respectively. Across nine of the largest global crowdfunding platforms, female-led campaigns were 32 percent more successful at reaching their funding target than male-led campaigns.  

Crowdfunding connects founders of new ventures with financial backers to launch or develop a new business, product or service. Seed crowdfunding increased from $10 million in 2009 to more than $767 million in 2016, with backers from over 200 countries. 
Even in the technology sector, where there are nine male-led campaigns to every one female-led campaign, female-led campaigns are more successful — 13 percent to 10 percent, respectively, the study found. The two highest-funded female campaigns were in the technology and the design sectors, while the two most popular — ranked by the largest number of individual backers — were in the technology and the food sectors.



Top 3 sectors for female-led campaign success
 Entertainment & media: 30 percent Retail & consumer goods: 22 percent Hospitality & leisure: 21 percent 
"It's obvious that women are discriminated against in many different areas, including funding. What I love about crowdfunding is it democratizes access to capital and, more importantly, the playing field," said Sherwood Neiss, principal at Crowdfund Capital Advisors.
Women owners represented about 40 percent of the 2,030 small businesses surveyed in the recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey. The survey of 2,030 business nationwide found that women are more likely to run the smallest firms. It revealed that 70 percent of women business owners have firms employing four people or less; for men it's 56 percent. Only 14 percent of women-owned businesses have 10 or more employees; for men it's 26 percent.
The success of female founders doesn't mean they are more likely to seek out crowdfunding as a source of business capital. Research shows that men tend to use crowdfunding more often than women.

"There's a general lack of awareness to this new form of capital raising," Neiss said. "Women don't know. Men don't know. But men know it more than women."
Women business owners surveyed by CNBC and SurveyMonkey were less likely to say technology innovations would have a positive effect on their business — 36 percent vs. 45 percent of male business owners. But female business owners are slightly more likely to use social media for customer communication and advertising.
Men also raise a lot more money than women, even if their success rate is lower. Just under 90 percent of crowdfunded campaigns raising more than $1 million were male-led campaigns.
Aoife Flood, senior manager of the global diversity and inclusion program at PwC, said the dearth of women in the traditional financing world is a difficult hurdle to overcome — men lend more to other men.




"The fact you don't have predominantly men making the funding decisions means that the affinity bias that appears so rife in traditional funding channels is mitigated. This is what gets the ball rolling for female crowdfunders."
-Aoife Flood, senior manager of the global diversity and inclusion program at PwC


Flood pointed to recent research showing that most decision-makers in the venture capital industry are male. Just 7 percent of partners at the top 100 venture firms globally are women. Among 2,300 venture and microventure firms, only 8 percent of partners are female. "Each of us is programmed with blind spots, and whether conscious or unconscious, we are drawn to people like us or who remind us of ourselves," Flood said.
Top 5 countries for female-led campaigns
 United States: 35,264 U.K.: 6,013 Canada: 3,109 Australia: 999 Germany: 679 
Research indicates that VCs with only male partners are more likely to invest in male-led projects or business and that male entrepreneurs are 86 percent more likely to be venture capital-funded than their female counterparts.
According to American Express data, women have increased business ownership by 45 percent in the past decade, a far faster rate than overall new business growth in the United States. Yet only 1 in every 4 loan applicants is a woman, and they ask for less than men do in loan amounts, are approved at a lower rate, and pay more in interest, according to online small-business lender Fundera. Online business credit marketplace Biz2Credit found a similar trend:  29 percent of the registrations on its platform came from female entrepreneurs.
Women-led businesses surveyed by CNBC/SurveyMonkey indicated they are less bullish on business growth in the next year and less likely to increase full-time staff. They also are less likely to use a business credit card or loan/financing to fund marketing, product, technology or other business initiatives. The survey also found that women are more likely to use rewards points as a source of financing.
"It has been common currency until now that women are less interested in business or even less able," said Barry James, co-founder and CEO of The Crowdfunding Centre. "These have been advanced as explanations as to why rates of funding [for women] in the older entrepreneurial economy have been so low. It's only now that we have the data to give the lie to this."
"The crowd is much more gender-balanced," Flood said. She added: "The fact you don't have predominantly men making the funding decisions means that the affinity bias that appears so rife in traditional funding channels is mitigated. This is what gets the ball rolling for female crowdfunders and fuels many of the factors that lead to their seed crowdfunding success." 
The crowd may also be more receptive to the way women pitch:
"Women tend to be much more relationship-focused. Female crowdfunders use more emotive and inclusive language in their campaign pitches and videos ... This is more likely to resonate with the crowd," Flood said.
Male-led campaigns use more technical business language, and research has shown that is negatively correlated with backer funding.
"The biggest challenge for any campaign is clear communication, getting across to the potential backer, not just the proposition but also the vision behind it — the 'why' as well as the 'what,'" Flood said. "This is very different than just providing the information or describing the proposition as you see it, and takes a surprising degree of skill and mental agility. Empathy is key, and I can say this as someone with a long history in tech, we 'geeks' are not best known for our social skills — especially male geeks."
According to the CNBC/SurveyMonkey data, women-owned businesses are slightly more likely to generate a majority of revenue from individual consumers — 74 percent vs. 68 percent for men.
Flood said the wide lead for men in the overall number of campaigns and dollars raised points to the tech-industry roots of crowdfunding. "It's a financial tech innovation, and like the technology sector more broadly, this is an area dominated by men. Female entrepreneurs are also less networked or engaged in the world of funding because it too is male-dominated. There is a lack of awareness that is limiting female representation in crowdfunding," the PwC executive said.



It's a new starting point

The seed crowdfunding studied by PwC and The Crowdfunding Centre is distinct from all "rewards" crowdfunding campaigns, which can also include donation campaigns, albeit with a large overlap. But the distinction is a very important one when trying to understand crowdfunding as a source of seed capital, and its very different gender profile in accessing business capital, James said.  "What we are doing is showing that when the basis of decision-making is changed from investors making investment decisions to a market directly backing innovations without participants incurring significant individual risk, the gender profile makes an unexpected hyper-jump from women being consistently far far behind, to women consistently well ahead."James added that while crowdfunding campaigns usually represent businesses at a very early stage, he views ventures and established firms on a continuum based on current size and growth potential. "Seed crowdfunding is a new starting point for all, including those with plenty of the latter, but is much better at accommodating and supporting those lower down that scale that could still be viable, in the short or longer term, creating significant numbers of jobs and growth via a large number of smaller firms."

Goldman Sachs to Launch Online Lender this Fall with Consumer Loan Product
 Tweet Share21 Share151 +12 Reddit Pin1 EmailShares 175

July 20, 2016 @ 9:30 pm By JD Alois 


Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) announced earnings yesterday and beyond beating market expectations, the investment bank revealed some of its intentions on the forthcoming launch of its online lending platform later this fall. The news that Goldman Sachs was moving into the online lending sector came over a year ago when Quartz got a copy of an internal memo following the hire of  Harit Talwar following his departure from Discover in April 2015.
Earlier this year, Stephen Scherr, Chief Strategy Office of Goldman Sachs, clarified the banks strategy, following the acquisition of $15 billion of deposits from GE Bank, stating the growing deposit base could support their peer to peer lending strategy.
During the earnings call, Goldman Sachs CFO Harvey Schwartz updated on their online lending approach;
“We are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort. We are looking to build a durable business so it will take time.”
Asked specifically about the GE Deposit acquisition, GS Bank and an update on the online lending progress, Schwartz explained;
“We view those as separate. Having said that, the acquisition went well adding in excess of $15 billion of deposits to the firm …  We have had in excess of 20,000 consumers open up new accounts with us. We have had very significant growth in a short period of time. It really speaks to the brand strength.”
“In terms of the longer-term objectives, we hired Harit over a year ago and he has been a fantastic addition to the team. He has built a very capable team over that period of time … we are keenly aware this is a new business opportunity for us and importantly a new client base. One of the things we did was to reach out to thousands of consumers to really understand what they want and what are their borrowing priorities. Through that we learned some things that are probably not that surprising. They want a product that is simple, straightforward that provides a lot of value. They also want a high quality user experience. What we’ve attempted to do is to take all of this feedback and develop one product which we plan to launch later this fall. So that is where we stand.”
Asked to clarify what GS mean by one specific product, Schwartz pointed to unsecured consumer loans putting Lending Club and Prosper right in their cross-hairs.
Slow build…
An analyst from JMP asked the question;
“Is there a case for buying something? … So you get to a critical mass more quickly?”
Schwartz qualified the query as a very good question;
“…We will just weight the costs and benefits of acquiring versus building in house. This particular effort when we looked at it we  really felt like it was best designed from scratch. The reason for that is we are kind of uniquely positioned. It allows us to leverage our technology skills, and our risk skills … if you look at the competitive landscape there are benefits that online lending platforms provide to consumers and there are benefits for large commercial providers of credit … we are really looking to bridge the gap between those strengths and offer consumers, the best we can, a really thoughtful, differentiated product.”
We well learn more this coming fall.

Real Estate Related Crowdfunding & P2P Lending Surge in China: Opportunity or Crisis? 
 Tweet Share26 Share38 +1 Reddit Pin EmailShares 64

March 25, 2016 @ 11:25 am By Lao Zhuo,  Weiyangx 


The property prices in China’s major cities has surged in recent months, first in Shenzhen, then Shanghai and Beijing. The rapid appreciation of property is drawing people’s attention back to the concept of real estate crowdfunding.
Four types of real estate crowdfunding
Real estate crowdfunding was first launched in US, and then introduced to China in 2014. By 2015, there were about 15 real estate crowdfunding platforms in China (e.g. Fangbaobao and Haofang Crowdfunding).
In terms of fundraising purpose, China’s real estate crowdfunding activities could fall into four major categories:
Development & Purchase
Compared with traditional a funding channel (e.g. bank or trust), crowdfunding helps reduce the total cost. Crowdfunding is used by developers that could not get easier access to capital, but it also attracts certain groups of consumers before the construction starts.
Individuals crowdfunding for this category of project have a rigid demand for housing. They will get a 20% to 30% discount, but usually have to pay the discounted price in full when they purchase the property.
It may be regarded as an innovation of real estate development, yet it may risk violating the present regulations regarding the real estate approval process.
Development & Investment
Real estate products, especially in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, are seen as highly profitable. Developers initiate REITs crowdfunding campaigns to realize the value of real-estate projects which is usually high in total price and raise the funds for developing the project.
Crowdfunders treat this category of project as an investment opportunity. Asset management companies generate the profits for the crowdfunders from property rental or property management fees. One example is the “Wenzhuan No.1” from Wanda Group.
Marketing & Purchase
In this circumstance, consumers with rigid housing demand crowdfund for existing housing projects. This model works typically well for certain developers who are under pressure to reduce inventory, which is usually regarded as an innovative marketing method.
Marketing & Investment
This is a typical type of REITs product. Developers scarify some profits to de-inventory and raise brand awareness, while the crowdfunders invest with the hope to benefit from value-added income. One example is the crowdfunding projects co-initiated by Fangbaobao and Zhongxin Palace Garden.
Regulators suspend P2P down payment loans
Among the different sections of fintech, crowdfunding and peer to peer lending are the most talked about in China. Since real estate has already got a connection with crowdfunding, it is not strange to see related P2P lending products emerge.
It is estimated that there are at least 660 P2P lending platforms providing real estate lending services now, most of which are down payment lending, redemption lending and decoration lending.
Down payment lending lowers the house purchasing threshold, but it also raises the house-purchase leverage. For instance, speculators can buy real estate at a relative low price and sell it shortly to gain a profit of 10 thousand yuan. That’s why the product is so popular. Yet for house buyers with rigid demand, they will not only suffer from the present pressure, but may be forced to give up or put off the purchasing plan due to the rocketing price driven by speculators.
In fact, people cannot borrow for a down payment loan according to China’s present regulation. The percentage of down payments for individual housing is set by POBC. Down payment lending goes against the real estate legislation and may introduce policy risk.
At present, the risk is still under control. However, nobody knows whether a dramatic price would lead to a systematic crisis.
Updated
Chinese government has already responded to and started investigating down payment loans. Shenzhen Municipal Financial Services Office took the first step, requiring investigation towards all P2P and micro-finance companies involved in real estate crowdfunding, down payment loan and other leveraged mortgages. Meanwhile, Beijing Municipal Bureau of Financial Work guided Beijing P2P Association to go through an investigation among the member platforms. According to an anonymous source, Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development has also held an urgent talk with some real estate agencies which have been involved in the down payment loan issues. As the investigation goes on, major agencies like HomeLink and 5i5j.com have ceased down payment loans.

United States
PeerIQ’s MPL Securitization Tracker for Q3 2016, (PeerIQ), Rated: AAA

Marketplace lending securitization remains a bright spot in the ABS market. Total issuance topped $2.3 billion this quarter—a record—and is up 34.8% from Q2, with cumulative issuance now totaling $12.6 billion.  YTD issuance of the sector stands at $5.4 billion as compared to $3.0 billion from the prior year, an 80% increase as compared to a 10% decrease in non-MPL ABS issuance.


Although MPL origination volumes have declined at some platforms, ABS issuance is increasing as is the proportion of loans funded by ABS. The percentage of loans funded by ABS is over 50%.


The movement towards rated securitizations at larger transaction sizes continues.  All the deals issued in the third quarter were rated, with the exception of LCIT 2016-NP1. Further, the growth in average deal size continued, growing to $267 million in 2016 as compared to $64 million in 2013.


New issuance spreads continued to tighten in—a friendly environment for securitization.  Across all segments in MPL, Q3 2016 saw spread compression across each part of the capital structure, indicating strong investor appetite for MPL ABS paper in the market.


We estimate $6.0 to $10.3 billion MPL ABS issuance for 2017. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citi take top positions on the league tables.


Differences in execution and losses are emerging across issuers. SoFi maintains a significant execution advantage over peer originators, and remains the largest issuer in the category. PeerIQ expects 3 additional deals to breach loss triggers in the coming months.

With new mutual funds, marketplace lenders continue to seek diversified sources of capital, (Tradestreaming), Rated: AAA
The first two marketplace lending mutual funds were approved in the U.S.
Total size of marketplace lending securitization issuance volume to date is $10.3 billion.
The first two marketplace lending mutual funds, sponsored by Stone Ridge Asset Management and RiverNorth Capital Management, were approved recently in the U.S. by the S.E.C., with similar funds launched earlier in the U.K.
“This is an exciting opportunity for RiverNorth and our investors,” said Philip Bartow, co-portfolio manager of the RiverNorth fund. “The benefit of being early to the retail market will give us the enhanced ability to purchase loans directly from quality online lending partners with whom RiverNorth has negotiated loan acquisition and servicing relationships.”
More funds have filed to become ’40 Act funds for marketplace lending and are awaiting S.E.C. approval.
Though anyone can invest directly on the marketplace lending platforms, they are cumbersome compared to mutual funds, a product investors and advisors know how to manage. In order to invest in marketplace lending, one needs to open a new account and learn a new set of analytical tools to aggregate and select loans that fit his risk preferences. If an investor wants to invest in more than one platform, this problem might become prohibitive.
Alternatively, hedge funds, which comprise a big chunk of the capital in marketplace lending, are only open to accredited investors. Launching these mutual funds will give retail investors easier access to consumer debt.
“By expanding marketplace loans to a broader investor base, these new funds will transform the industry and could eventually move today’s platforms towards principal broker-dealer markets, similar to other fixed income instruments,” Monja, a marketplace lending analytics solution, explained in a blog post.
TransUnion Launches Fraud Prevention Exchange to Reduce Online Fraud, (TransUnion Email), Rated: AAA
TransUnion data show that, on average, 4.5% of borrowers take out more than one personal loan on the same day.
TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) today announced the launch of its 4 charts on the state of digital transformation in banks, (Tradestreaming), Rated: AAA
Only 11 percent of banking executives plan to enhance mobile or omnichannel banking this year.
Projects prioritized in the next 24 months, are more likely to be middle- and back-office focused, like building an enterprise-wide compliance architecture.
 
Ten fintech start-ups that are causing a stir in insurance, (Financial Times), Rated: A
Insurtech — or instech — is now attracting entrepreneurs and the investors that back them.
The start-ups are targeting all parts of insurance. Many are focusing on distribution, using new technology to reach consumers that traditional insurers miss. Others are looking at analytics, helping insurers to use data to make better underwriting decisions. Blockchain — the technology that underpins bitcoin — is increasingly popular, while health insurance has been a big area of start-up activity in the US. Nor have start-ups ignored the potential of the “internet of things” — the growing use of data-collecting devices in everyday items, from cars using telematics systems to connected homes.
Few start-ups have become full, risk-bearing insurers. Analysts say that the capital requirements, regulatory burden and complexity required, combined with the desire of investors for short-term returns, means that very few of them underwrite their own policies.
Form D Alert: Crowd Lending Fund One Filing. Daniel Najarian Submitted Oct 5 SEC Form, (Frisco Fastball), Rated: A
The Massachusetts-based Crowd Lending Fund One, Llc had published FormD because of $10.00 million offering. This is a new filing. The Limited Liability Company raised $1.05 million so far. That is 10.50% of the $10.00 million offering. The total offering amount was $10.00 million. This form was filed on 2016-10-05. Crowd Lending Fund One, Llc’s clarification was: none. The offering has $8.95 million left to be raised and is still open.
Crowd Lending Fund One is based in Massachusetts. The company’s business is Pooled Investment Fund. The SEC form was submitted by Daniel Najarian Manager. The company was incorporated in 2016. The filler’s address is: 17 Main Street, Watertown, Ma, Massachusetts, 02472. Daniel Najarian is the related person in the form and it has address: 17 Main Street, Watertown, Ma, Massachusetts, 02472. Link to Crowd Lending Fund One Filing: 000168619216000001.
On average, companies in the Pooled Investment Fund sector, sell 37.80% pooled investment interest. Crowd Lending Fund One sold 10.50% of the offering. The average offering amount is $24.76 million for companies in the Pooled Investment Fund industry sector. The total amount raised is 95.76% smaller than the average for companies in the Pooled Investment Fund sector.
Payoneer raises $ 180 million for its global payments technology, (TechCrunch), Rated: A
Payoneer, a global provider of payment processing technologies, has added another $180 million to its already sizable war chest as it looks to continue to grow its payment services.
Already profitable, and with a solid amount of cash on the balance sheet, the new money will double the company’s product development and technical staff, according to the company’s chief executive officer Scott Galit.
For now, the company’s focus seems to be on China, where Payoneer has launched local bank account services in China for customers that don’t have Chinese accounts.
Oleg Seydak on Blackmoon & Marketplace Lending as a Service, (Crowdfund Insider), Rated: A
Blackmoon Financial Group is a newer entry into the marketplace lending sector.  Launched in 2014, Blackmoon is marketed as “marketplace lending as a service” or MLaaS. Focusing on balance sheet lenders, Blackmoon has developed technologies to provide integration with  loan originators with institutional investors. The platform started in Europe – starting with Russia – and adding multiple platforms before crossing the Atlantic. Blackmoon has also launched a $100 million fund, along with Target Asset Management, to invest in loans originated by European balance sheet lenders. Announced early in 2016, the fund is open to international investors with minimum commitment size of €125,000 and targeting annual returns of 12-13% net of fees.
This past July, Blackmoon entered the US marketing opening an office in Manhattan.
Blackmoon has set an ambitious goal of $1 billion in brokered loans by the end of 2017.
So far, Blackmoon has had a “good experience in the US”. They currently have 5 institutional investors using their platform including 3 family offices and 2 private equity funds.
The most difficult part of setting up operations in the US?  The regulatory environment.
“We have already spent a good amount of money on counsel and attorneys. It is hard to get a clear answer and it is costly.  There is no “stop factor”…”
Tests of character, (The Economist), Rated: AAA
How personality testing could help financial inclusion.
In rich countries, lenders use credit scores to weigh risk. But just 7% of Africans and 13% of South Asians are covered by private credit bureaus. Bailey Klinger of the Entrepreneurial Finance Lab (EFL), which explores new kinds of credit data, argues that psychometrics could scoop many more people into the financial system. Everyone has a personality, after all.
Some lenders are convinced. Grupo Monge, a retailer, uses psychometrics to sell household goods on credit to low-income Peruvians. “Most of the time we are the first company to give them credit,” says Gabriel Trelles, its boss in Peru. The biggest market for psychometrics is for such consumer loans. But microlenders and banks are catching on. EFL’s software has been used in 690,000 loan decisions in 27 countries. Creditinfo will use its psychometrics unit, recently acquired from a marketing firm, to expand in emerging markets.
The technique is still in its infancy and will not replace credit bureaus, says Miriam Bruhn of the World Bank. The best way to tell if somebody will repay a loan in future is to see if they have repaid one in the past. But bureaus improve more slowly than technology. Lenders, looking for an edge, will find ever more ways to peer into their customers’ souls.

Canada
Financeit announces $US17 million investment round led by The Pritzker Organization, DNS Capital and existing investors, (Email), Rated: AAA
Financeit, a point-of-sale financing provider, today announced a new round of equity financing led by new investors–Pritzker family business interests advised by The Pritzker Organization, L.L.C. (“TPO”) and DNS Capital, LLC (“DNS”)– as well as existing investors.
The capital raise, which follows the close of a minority equity financing round led by Goldman Sachs in October 2015, will also support the ongoing needs of the company as it continues its rapid growth.
This investment round of $US17 million ($CAD22 million) enabled Financeit to fund the recently-announced acquisition of TD Bank Group’s indirect home improvement financing assets, which included the purchase of more than 800 merchant dealer agreements and the transition of a number of former TD relationship managers and operational staff.
After a transition period, the transaction will also lead to Financeit servicing approximately 45,000 existing TD consumer loans.
United Kingdom
Two P2P Sharing Economy Players Team Up– Airbnb and Zopa, (Finovate), Rated: AAA
Here’s how it works, upon logging into their Zopa dashboard, borrowers click a link to sign up to become an Airbnb host. If they earn £500 from Airbnb within six months, they get £50 off their loan. If they earn £1,000 from Airbnb rentals, they get £100 off. U.K. hosts earn an average of £2,000 per year for renting their home for 46 nights, which means borrowers would need to rent out their homes around 18 times over the course of a year to take full advantage of Zopa’s offer.
While the partnership makes sense for Zopa– it’s a focused way to help borrowers increase their income– I don’t envision banks making the same move.
Zopa debuted at FinovateSpring 2008. Since then, the company has weathered the ups and downs of the financial crisis and the P2P lending industry itself. Earlier this year, Zoparevamped its product lineup, debuting Classic, Access, and Plus, which allows institutions to lend to higher risk borrowers. In May, the company began offering auto loan refinancing, tapping into the used car financing market. Most recently, Zopa appointed Ronen Benchtrit as its CTO in an effort to grow its technology strategy.
CrowdBnk Re-Launches & Rebrands as Code Investing, (Crowdfund Insider), Rated: A
Our focus on supporting proven small businesses seeking larger sums of growth capital, means we no longer feel the name CrowdBnk is fully representative of what we do and the services we provide. We have never been a bank and neither do we wish to emulate their position.
Management stated that around one-in-ten firms are considering P2P lending in the coming year. Additionally, one in six firms with revenues over £10 million are considering this option.  This data supported the decision to reposition their platform and help SMEs raise between £1 million to £20 million in financing.
European Union
Aztec Exchange launches online early payment solution ePayMe in Spain through Grupo SERES, (Email), Rated: A
DUBLIN, IRELAND and MADRID, SPAIN – Aztec Exchange, a global supplier of invoice finance products and services, today announced the launch in Spain of its early payment solution ePayMe (payme.cloud/es/) through Grupo SERES, reaching their 6,000 SME clients.  With this partnership, Aztec continues to grow its position among European SMEs seeking early payment – a nearly €1.6 trillion market.[i]
ePayMe takes traditional early payment services like factoring and turns it on its head.  Typically issuing payment within 24 hours, ePayMe offers complete transparency, so there are no hidden costs or interest charges, and suppliers only pay minimal fees. Additionally, a supplier can sell as many invoices as it wants, provided the corporate debtors are creditworthy, and there are no long-term contracts.

Australia
Marketplace Lender DirectMoney Appoints New CEO, (Crowdfund Insider), Rated: A
Australian marketplace lending platformDirectMoney has appointed Anthony Nantes as CEO. Former CEO Peter Beaumont will move into the Chief Operating Officer role. DirectMoney released a statement that Nantes will bring a set of skills that will deliver the next phase of company growth.
He was previously Chief Operating Officer at Prospa, a fintech lending company, which during his tenure in 2015 was recognised by Deloitte as the fastest growing technology company in Australia.
DirectMoney is listed on the ASX and shares have performed poorly during the past 12 months. The company has garnered some support from Macquarie Group but has struggled at times to find sufficient capital to fund loans.  The most recent financial results published indicate top line growth of 177% and loan originations growth of 77%.  The company continues to deliver a net loss.
India
Faircent forays into secured loan, (Business Standard), Rated: A
Faircent, country’s largest peer-to-peer (P2P) lending firm, has now started focusing on secured loans, a segment that these players had so far not been present in. Now, with tie-ups with companies the firm has forayed into auto loans and is eyeing dispensing loans for other asset backed products.
Vinay Mathews, Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer,Faircent explained that apart from personal loans, even for the secured products some consumers may find it difficult to take a loan because of their income or risk profile.
Apart from this Faircent is also looking at exploring other products such as gold loans, loan against property etc.
As per a RBI report in April, there are around 30 start-up P2P lending companies in India, RBI said. Globally, the cumulative lending through P2P platforms at the end of fourth quarter of 2015 reached ?4.4 billion, from just ?2.2 million in 2012. And in most countries where these firms are allowed to exist they are treated as banking intermediaries. Now, even RBI is looking at regulating this sector and is supposed to come out with guidelines pertaining to it.
