History and background[edit]
In 2015, PJT Partners, Inc. was created from a merger of the advisory arm of The Blackstone Group (which had operated for thirty years) and PJT Capital LP, a strategic advisory firm founded by Paul J. Taubman in 2013.[1][6] PJT Partners' first day of trading was on October 1, 2015;[6] on the same day, it became publicly traded, listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol PJT.[7] On its first day of trading, PJT had 330 employees and 46 partners.[6]
Blackstone’s decision to do the spin-off was largely driven by the conflicts of interest that arose between Blackstone’s advisory services business and its investing businesses, including private equity, real estate investing and hedge funds.[8]
In March 2016, PJT partner Andrew Caspersen was arrested on federal charges of securities and wire fraud.[9] Federal prosecutors allege that Caspersen engaged in a scheme to defraud investors of up to $95 million.[9] Caspersen was quickly fired, and PJT released a statement saying that it was cooperating with the authorities and was "stunned and outraged" to hear about the allegations.[9]
Leadership[edit]
Paul J. Taubman has served as the chairman and chief executive of PJT Partners since its inception in 2015, and was the founder of its predecessor firm, PJT Capital LP, in 2013.[10] He previously spent approximately 30 years at Morgan Stanley, where he was Co-President of Institutional Securities.[7][11][12] Bloomberg News reported that Taubman was the second-highest-paid U.S. executive of 2015 (after Patrick Soon-Shiong), earning $164 million in awarded pay.[13]
In 2015, before the firm began operations, Taubman hired a number of senior European bankers to lead PJT Partners' European operation.[14] Soon after the firm was founded, former NBA Commissioner David J. Stern joined the firm as a senior adviser.[15]
Business and competitors[edit]
The firm is organized across three business lines:[16] Strategic Advisory handles M&A, capital markets advisory, spin-offs, private placements, structured products and other transactions.[16] Restructuring & Special Situations handles debtor advisory, creditor advisory, out-of-court solutions, distressed M&A and expert witness testimony.[16] The Park Hill Group provides services for private equity, real estate, hedge funds and secondary advisory services.[16]
The firm competes with all investment banks that provide strategic advisory services.[12][17]

Paul J. Taubman is the Chairman and CEO of PJT Partners, an advisory-focused investment bank.  Mr. Taubman founded PJT Partners in early 2013 and, in October 2014, announced the intention to merge into the spun-off Blackstone advisory businesses.  The newly combined company was formed and began trading on the NYSE on October 1, 2015.
Prior to founding PJT Partners, Mr. Taubman spent almost 30 years at Morgan Stanley in a series of increasingly significant leadership positions including Co-President of Institutional Securities.  After retiring from Morgan Stanley in 2012, he served in an independent capacity to advise companies on a number of significant transactions before starting PJT Partners.  Mr. Taubman received his BS in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and his MBA from Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business.  Mr. Taubman is involved in numerous philanthropic activities including serving as Board President of New York Cares, a Trustee and Executive Committee member of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a National Advisory Board member of Youth INC, and a Trustee of the Foundation for Educating Children with Autism.

When the longtime investment banker Paul J. Taubman left Morgan Stanley in late 2012, no one was quite sure what he would do next.Then, over the next two years, he helped spearhead two huge takeover bids — for Verizon and Comcast — climbing the ranks of Wall Street’s deal makers as a virtual one-man mergers advisory business.Now, Mr. Taubman is set to begin the next stage of his career: leading a new publicly traded investment bank formed from the merger of his own budding operations and the 30-year-old advisory arm of the Blackstone Group.The firm, PJT Partners, will begin trading on Thursday, testing whether Mr. Taubman can lead a rapidly assembled team of specialists in mergers, reorganizations and fund-raising for investment funds in the spotlight of the public markets.

“This wasn’t on my radar when I left,” Mr. Taubman, 54, said in a telephone interview. “It’s just how the world played out. But I’m excited we’re in this place.” Continue reading the main story

So-called boutique and independent investment banks have gained ground in recent years as longtime deal makers created new firms devoted solely to advising clients on takeovers and other transactions. Unlike the big firms, from which most of those bankers hailed, the new firms do not have huge trading desks or lending arms.Boutiques now make up about 30 percent of the market for merger advisory fees, according to data from Thomson Reuters, having risen fairly steadily from 13 percent in 2000.During that time, a flurry of independent firms — some publicly traded, some not — opened. They include the likes of Evercore Partners, Centerview Partners and Moelis & Company, all formed by Wall Street veterans.PJT is on the smaller side of those firms, with 330 employees and 46 partners. The 167-year-old Lazard, by contrast, has nearly eight times as many people on its staff.But PJT is being led by one of the top-ranked deal makers on Wall Street: Mr. Taubman, a 33-year veteran who presided over multibillion-dollar transactions involving not only the likes of Comcast but also the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. Perhaps his most important deal, however, was helping to secure an investment for Morgan Stanley from the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan, a crucial lifeline during the financial crisis.The birth of PJT has taken place on an unusually fast timeline. After leaving Morgan Stanley, Mr. Taubman slowly began assembling his own team, including former colleagues like Scott Matlock and Johannes Groeller.But Blackstone’s senior management, including its co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman, contacted Mr. Taubman late last year asking him to take over the business that became the foundation for what is now a $330 billion investment giant.

Mr. Schwarzman, who began his ascent on Wall Street as a mergers banker himself, has spoken fondly of the advisory business. But the division increasingly suffered from conflicts with the firm’s other, much bigger investing operations.

Continue reading the main story

Some private equity firms, for example, did not want to hire Blackstone bankers to advise their portfolio companies when their colleagues at the Blackstone-owned GSO hedge fund were taking opposite bets on the debt of those companies.Bringing in Mr. Taubman and spinning off the advisory business would solve that problem.“This is a firm that has been able to achieve leadership positions with arguably one hand tied behind its back,” Mr. Schwarzman said.Soon after Mr. Taubman’s arrival, changes took place even faster at the advisory business, with about half the merger partners departing. In came notables like John Trousdale, a media deal maker from Credit Suisse, and Don Cornwell, a sports banker from Morgan Stanley.In the meantime, the restructuring team, led by Timothy Coleman, and the advisory business’s Park Hill fund-raising group, led by Dan Prendergast, were left alone. But being part of a firm focused entirely on advisory work would bring additional benefits, including regular access to the chief executive for clients.“What you have now is like the beginning of Blackstone,” Mr. Coleman said. “The head of the firm will go on pitches.”In the span of a year, the management team has had to make other decisions big and small, from the name of the firm to new office space in Manhattan and elsewhere around the world.When it begins trading, the question is whether the year of preparation will arm the firm for business, particularly in a still-frothy market for mergers. PJT so far has secured mandates on deals like Altice’s $9.6 billion acquisition of Cablevision and $9.1 billion takeover of the cable provider Suddenlink, as well as the sale of a huge stake in the Economist Group to a wealthy Italian clan.But if the environment for deals cools, the financial restructuring team is meant to provide a useful counterweight, according to PJT executives. And the Park Hill fund-raising business should remain a constant source of revenue.“When we think of this enormous M.&A. market out there, we expect to have real market share gains,” Mr. Taubman said. “Even if it cools a bit, it works to our favor if our other businesses outperform.”

Paul J. Taubman, The Merger King Behind The Massive Comcast-Time Warner Cable Deal

 Business  Paul J. Taubman, The Merger King Behind The Massive Comcast-Time Warner Cable Deal By  Marcus Baram  @mbaram   On 02/13/14 AT 1:34 PM             Paul J. Taubman, retired adviser, is the merger king of Wall Street   Photo: Reuters   For a retiree who got bumped out of his last job, Paul J. Taubman is enjoying the last laugh.The 53-year-old banker was passed over for the top job at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)’s mergers and acquisitions division in 2012, essentially forcing him to quit. Since then, he has become a merger king, the man at the heart of some of the biggest deals in recent years.Taubman, who at 6-foot-3 towers over many of his peers on Wall Street, was the sole individual adviser involved in the biggest merger of 2014 so far – Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)’s $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc (NYSE:TWC), which was consummated Wednesday afternoon. The deal netted Taubman a fee rumored to be close to $10 million. (He and the banks that advised Comcast on the deal – Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase – will split a $50 million to $70 million fee, according to estimates from Freeman & Company.)Just last year, he netted $10 million for advising Verizon Communication Inc. (NYSE:VZ)’s $130 billion takeover of its Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone, playing a key role in negotiating the complicated deal.Even before the Comcast deal, Taubman’s success stands out in the competitive world of M&A. Last year’s ranking of the top financial advisers on technology, media and telecom deals is dominated by the biggest banks in the world – Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) … and Taubman, according to Mergermarket.com. At No. 8 on the top 10 list, he ranked higher than such financial behemoths as Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) and Deutsche Bank.“I can’t really recall an individual ever appearing in the league tables,” says Jeffrey Nassof, an associate with Freeman & Company's consulting division.Taubman, who lives in an apartment on Central Park West that used to belong to actor Robin Williams and was a major contributor to Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, worked at Morgan Stanley for more than 30 years. The son of an accountant, he soon dominated some of the biggest mergers in history – lead adviser on Comcast’s $58.7 billion purchase of AT&T Broadband in 2002 and adviser on Time Warner’s $124 billion merger with AOL Inc. (NYSE:AOL).Taubman put it best at a breakfast discussion last month when asked whether he wants to build his own advisory boutique:“Retirement is fun, so I’m not sure there’s a reason to change.”

Paul Taubman earned more than you last year.  Tina Fineber--The New York Times/Redux PicturesCEO payBloomberg Just Named This Guy "Wall Street's Highest Paid Executive"Ian SalisburyApr 29, 2016Paul J. Taubman is new king of Wall Street, at least according to pay data compiled by financial news and information company Bloomberg.The former Morgan Stanley banker, now chief executive of PJT Partners Inc. (yes, ahem, it stands for Paul J. Taubman) was awarded compensation totaling $164 million last year, more than any other banker on Wall Street, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index.By contrast some other, better-known Wall Street honcho's earned less: Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein took home a "mere" $33.1 million, while JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon earned $30.4 million.There is a big catch. Taubman's pay is almost entirely in the form of stock in PJT, a publicly-traded boutique merger advisory firm (in other words, PJT helps companies buy other companies) that was spun off from Blackstone Group LP in October.There is no guarantee Taubman, 55, will ultimately get it all. Just over half, $86 million, is tied to him boosting PJT's stock price, Bloomberg reports. To receive the full amount Taubman will have to more than triple the company's market value in the next five years. That would be big pay for a big accomplishment.Of course, the dirty secret of Wall Street has always been that while the rewards are handsome for success, they can also be handsome for mediocrity. In addition to Taubman's $250,000 base salary, the rest of his pay will come in the form of a $78 million stock grant that he will be able to fully cash out in 2019, regardless of how PJT's stock does.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers
