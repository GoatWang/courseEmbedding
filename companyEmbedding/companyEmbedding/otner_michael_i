What are analysts saying about Medidata Solutions stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Medidata Solutions stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Medidata Solutions is a leading global provider of hosted clinical development solutions that enhance the efficiency of customers' clinical development processes and optimize their research and development investments. Medidata products and services allow customers to achieve clinical results more efficiently and effectively by streamlining the design, planning and management of key aspects of the clinical development process, including protocol development (Medidata Designer), investigator benchmarking and budgeting (Medidata Grants Manager), contract research organization (CRO) benchmarking and budgeting (Medidata CRO Contractor), and the capture, management, analysis and reporting of clinical trial data (Medidata Rave). Medidata's diverse customer base spans pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, academic institutions, CROs and other research organizations, and includes some top global pharmaceutical companies.   " (7/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Based on several triangulations, FY17 revenue guidance appears to mark a very accurate target at the midpoint (not too high or low). The 18.7% midpoint growth would need to further accelerate to 22% in '18-'20 to achieve management's $1B goal by '20. Beating the '16 sales performance seems like a tall order. MDSO now trades at 5.6x '17 revenue compared to 4.4x for SaaS peers with similar growth." (2/10/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Medidata Solutions (NASDAQ:MDSO) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 10 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.91)Consensus Price Target: $78.45 (2.15% upside)
