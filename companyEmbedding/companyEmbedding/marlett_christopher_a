Christopher A. Marlett
Co-Founder, CEO


Christopher Marlett is CEO and Founder of MDB Capital Group LLC. His entire 26 year career has been focused on financing emerging growth companies in the public markets.
During the last 15 years he transitioned to a core focus of financing companies that possess potentially disruptive technology. He has become a thought leader in the area of financing development stage companies in the public markets as a preferable alternative to traditional venture capital. Additionally he began studying the impact of intellectual property as a method of gaining and retaining market leadership. This led to the development of PatentVest, the first business intelligence database platform focused upon intellectual property.
He has co-founded or launched four companies into the public markets from near inception that progressed to over $1B in market value. His exclusive focus today is on financing disruptive technology. He also developed a process for creation and execution of a dominant IP position for the companies he finances as a method to gain market leadership. Mr. Marlett graduated from the University of Southern California in 1986 with a B.S. in Business Administration.
