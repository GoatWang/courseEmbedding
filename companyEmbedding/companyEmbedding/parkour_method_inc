This documentation shows you how to build a new iOS or Android project using parkour method’s location framework.


The Parkour Method framework is designed to provide very high accuracy and location precision in your app, while minimizing battery consumption. Adding CoreLocation is not required to build a new location-driven project or to upgrade an existing location-driven project. The Parkour Method framework automatically includes the CoreLocation functions to your project, so it’s not necessary to include the CoreLocation framework with your project. Energy consumption is managed automatically by the Parkour framework; the processes sleep when appropriate, and dynamically adjust gps settings to adapt to different environmental conditions and the activity of the user. In normal operation, the framework will consistently consume less than 1% of the battery life per hour, and max at about 2.5% per hour for the highest location acquisition rates. You’re in control of the higher battery consumption rate by adjusting the setInterval setting (discussed in this documentation). If you’re already using a location manager in your app, the parkour framework won’t consume additional power.

If you’re already using a location manager in your app, the parkour framework won’t consume additional power. Project requirements and notes for using the parkour location framework:

iOS 8.x or higher required (compatible with iOS 8.x and tested on iOS 9.x through 9.3 beta).
Bitcode is enabled for the framework — you aren’t required to enable bitcode, but if you do, the parkourframework will compile correctly for you.
iOS devices which include location hardware and support iOS 8.x or higher.




Create New Xcode project
10 minutes to set up and run a new project using Parkour Method’s framework for iOS


We will develop a /File /New /Project single view application.





Give the project a name…








Required: Configure App Settings
Configure the project to allow for background updates by turning ‘on’ /Background Modes /Location Updates


Configure the project to allow for background updates by turning ‘on’ /Background Modes /Location Updates





Add to your project Info.plist the Required Background Modes to enable background location services:

    Required Background Modes Key Setting
Key: Required background Modes sub key: Item 0 Type: String Value: App registers for location updates






Create the user location notification text which will be displayed to users when requesting permission to obtain location information for the device. Note that if a consumer declines location permission, parkour method will not attempt to gather location data. The location notification is an opportunity to inform the consumer how and why you’re requesting location information, and how that information may be used or shared with 3rd parties. The required setting in your project Info.plist is:

    NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription Key Setting
Key: NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription Type: String Value: This app requires location services to operate properly…






Add bridging security permission for parkour method to properly log information requests (this step will not be necessary by mid-November 2015). If you don’t add this permission, you may see Apple App Transport Security warnings in your app’s console output (NSURLSession/NSURL Connection HTTP load failed…) NSAppTransportSecurity / NSExceptionDomains / logs-01.loggly.com / NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy / No

    NSAppTransportSecurity Exception Handling Key
Key: NSAppTransportSecurity sub Key: Exception Domains sub Key: logs-01.loggly.com sub Key: NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy Type: Boolean Value: NO







The project is now capable of:

Receiving background location updates
Allowing the app to continue to process location data while in the background
Automatically initiating the process to request a consumer’s permission to request location





Required: Add Parkour Framework

Add the parkour method framework to your project by dragging the parkour method framework file to your project. Remember to check “Copy Items if Needed” if you’re embedding the framework within your project folder.





Add the #import statement to add the parkour method framework to your file (line 10):
Objective-C
#import <parkour/parkour.h>
And start the framework (line 21) by adding our start command to your app delegate’s “application didFinishLauchingWithOptions” section (before the “return YES;” statement.
Objective-C

[parkour start];








Build and run the app using the simulator. If you see the pop-up message below, you’re ready! If not, make sure you didn’t miss a step in the process of adding the framework.





The parkour framework is now successfully installed, activated and working in the background. Congratulations! If you’re using the parkour framework for marketing insights, you can stop here. If you’d like to see the actual location data or tune the parkour framework for specific cases, please proceed to the next section.



Get Position Data
trackPositionWithHandler



We will add parkour’s location callback to ViewController.m
1) import the parkour framework header (line 10)

Objective-C

#import <parkour/parkour.h>

2) create the position tracking callback (lines 26 – 34):
Objective-C

[parkour trackPositionWithHandler:^(CLLocation *position, PKPositionType positionType, PKMotionType motionType) {

NSLog(@"position: %f,%f",position.coordinate.latitude,position.coordinate.longitude);

 }];

3) use [parkour start] to launch the parkour method framework (skip this step if you’ve called [parkour start] from AppDelegate.m). This command should be executed before establishing the location callback code. In this example project, we added [parkour start] to the AppDelegate.m file, so it’s not necessary to add it to ViewController.m.
Objective-C

[parkour start];

4) Initiate the callback code (line 22)
Objective-C

[self parkourLocationCallback];


5) Build and Run the project and you should begin to see data in the debug console. The default operating mode of the Parkour framework will produce a new location update every 1-3 minutes. This rate can be increased by using the setInterval function (see below). The callback is called no more than 1-2 times per second; any code you include in the callback will be executed whenever a new location point is ready to be reported. To stop receiving callbacks to the trackPositionWithHandler method, use stopTrackPosition:

Objective-C

[parkour StopTrackPosition];









Tune Update Frequency
setInterval & setTrackPositioMode


[parkour setInterval:…] is used to adjust the frequency of location updates. Use this setting to establish how often, in seconds, you’d like to receive a location callback. Valid settings are 1 – 175 seconds. Lower values will impact battery consumption. To resume normal low energy settings, set the setInterval value to 0 (zero).
Objective-C

[parkour setInterval:0];

In the sample app we set the interval to 2 seconds (line 24):
Objective-C

[parkour setInterval:2];


This causes parkour to return a fresh location point every 2 seconds. After adding the setInterval function (line 24), Build and Run the project and you’ll see location updates occur every 2 seconds. Remember to return setInterval to 0 when finished using this function to ensure the app returns to a very low energy consumption rate. These are typical settings used by Parkour’s customers for mapping activities:

For sharing frequent location points between users: 45-60 seconds
For maximizing automobile navigation: 5-9 seconds
Tracking jogging paths: 7 seconds
Geofencing: 60 seconds
Hiking paths: 90 seconds

[parkour setTrackPositionMode:…]; is a convenience shortcut to employ popular setInterval settings for various activity types. You can use this shortcut instead of setInterval. For example:

Objective-C

[parkour setTrackPositionMode:pkLowEnergy];

returns the Parkour framework to lowest energy consumption mode. [parkour setTrackPositionMode:pkFitness] is useful for mapping jogging/running activity outdoors:
Objective-C

[parkour setTrackPositionMode:pkFitness];









Use Extended Location Attributes
PKMotionType & PKPositionType


The parkour framework includes two special data types to indicate a device’s speed and outdoor/indoor position. These are the PKMotionType and PKPositionType. In 85-90% of conditions, these will accurately report whether a person is indoors, outdoors, etc. However, some edge conditions, such as standing indoors by a large window, may produce a false ‘outdoors’ or false ‘indoors’ reading — this is due to hardware limitations and we’re constantly improving edge cases like these in future framework releases. Combining PKMotionType and PKPositionType readings allows you to limit inaccurate readings due to edge conditions. In the example app we want to limit readings to outdoors readings in which a person is moving:
Objective-C

if ((positionType == pkOutdoors) && (motionType <pkDriving)) {
...
};

line 33 establishes an If statement limiting actions on readings to those which are outdoors and moving. This is a great way to map running or biking activity while a device is outdoors, and ignoring higher speed driving data. Build and Run the code and you’ll find you’re able to determine a user’s transportation type and position type. Adjust the if statement to remove limits placed on which positionType and motionType data you’d like to receive.








Get POI & Venue Visit Data (beta)
trackPOIWithHandler


Note: the database is in beta, but the callback is production ready. You’ll notice additional recognized venues and more accurate results as we upgrade our database. These database updates will not require you to make changes to your callback code. One of the special PKPositionType enums is pkVerifiedIndoors. This notification triggers an automatic venue search in Parkour Method’s venue and POI database. You can receive the results of this lookup by employing the trackPOIWithHandler callback. In the code below, lines 26-34 establish the trackPOIWithHandler callback:
Objective-C

[parkour trackPOIWithHandler:^(NSString *POIName, NSString *categoryOne, NSString *categoryTwo, NSString *fullAddress, NSString *city, NSString *state, NSString *zipcode, CLLocation *POIPosition, CLLocation *userPosition, double distance) {

        NSLog(@"here's our POI: %@/n %@/n %@, %@, %@",POIName,fullAddress,city,state,zip code);   // display results to console 

        }];

This will return the name of the -nearest- venue or POI which corresponds to the device’s current location. If the return distance value is < 15, there is a 90% confidence level the person is inside the venue. Values > 15 degrade in confidence levels. Parkour only returns commercial and public space data, the callback may not return a value for residential addresses or for businesses and public places which aren’t yet in our database (we’re in beta with this feature, right?) But Parkour recognizes over 3 Million businesses and commercial addresses in the US, so we’ll probably match the user’s location correctly. Build and run the code and see the results. If you’re indoors, after 2-3 minutes, you’ll receive a callback in the trackPOIWithHandler. You will receive only 1 callback for each verifiedIndoors point. To stop receiving updates via the trackPOIWithHandler method, use:
Objective-C

[parkour stopTrackPOI];









Special Parkour NS_Enum types
reference for PKMotionType, PKPositionType & PKPositionTrackingMode


Objective-C

typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, PKPositionType) {
    pkIndoors = 0, // we are indoors
    pkOutdoors,    // we are outdoors
    pkVerifiedIndoors  // we are confirmed indoors (95% confidence)
};

typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, PKMotionType) {
    pkNotMoving = 0,  // speed = 0 for current location
    pkWalking,   // walking speed
    pkRunning,  // typical jogging/running speed
    pkCycling,   // biking speed
    pkDriving,   // driving speed
    pkFlying  // i'm on a plane
};

typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, PKPositionTrackingMode) {
    pkLowEnergy = 0,  // most energy efficient setting/fewer updates
    pkGeofencing,  // used for geofencing
    pkPedestrian,  // to map pedestrian walks
    pkFitness,     // to map running/jogging activity
    pkAutomotive,  // to map driving activity
    pkShare  // ideal frequency for sharing location data with other devices
};




Low Energy Coding Tips

So you’ve started using parkour’s framework but you’re still seeing high battery drain? Use this checklist to isolate common causes of high energy drain: 1) [parkour setInterval…] setting this below 140 will consume more energy, up to 3% per hour (which is better than the 15-30% commonly observed with CLLocationManager, but still noticeable). Remember to return this value to 0 (zero) when finished mapping. 2) [parkour setTrackPositionMode…] the default setting is: [parkour setTrackPositionMode:pkLowEnergy]. Other settings will gain the battery at up to 3% per hour. 3) MKMapView will invoke a high battery burn rate location manager. If using MKMapView to visualize mapping data, remember to set showsUserLocation = NO. This removes the ‘blue dot’ showing a user location on a map view, but it also prevents MKMapView from invoking a new location manager running at extremely high energy. Replace the user location ‘blue dot’ with your own code (we’ll provide you the user point via the trackPositionWithHandler method). 4) Excessive location callbacks triggering excessive app processing. Parkour’s framework will reliably return location points every 2 minutes, or according to the setInterval or setTrackPositionMode settings you use. Make sure you’re acting on the location data you really care about; if you’re mapping outdoor hiking paths, ignore all PKPositionType data which indicates a person is indoors; or, if you’re building an automobile navigation app, ignore repeated data which returns a PKMotionType of pkNotMoving. 5) Background tracking. If background location notifications aren’t required, disable updating map delegates while the app is in the background, and disable expensive processing triggered by parkour callbacks. Re-enable processing when the app is brought to the foreground. 6) Contact us at: team@parkourmethod.com — if you still see problems let us know and we’ll address them right away.



Intro
This documentation shows you how to build a new Android project using parkour method’s location framework



The Parkour Method framework is designed to provide very high accuracy and location precision in your app, while minimizing battery consumption. Adding Google Play Services Location API is not required to build a new location-driven project or to upgrade an existing location-driven project. The Parkour Method framework replaces Google’s or your own custom location manager within your project. Energy consumption is managed automatically by the Parkour framework; the processes sleep when appropriate, and dynamically adjust gps settings to adapt to different environmental conditions and the activity of the user. In normal operation, the framework will consistently consume less than 1% of the battery life per hour. You’re in control of the higher battery consumption rate by adjusting the pkSetInterval setting (discussed in this documentation). Project requirements and notes for using the parkour location framework:

Android 4.1 Jellybean (SDK 16) or higher required (compatible with Android 4.1.x and tested on 5.x (Lollipop) through 6.0 (Marshmallow)).
Android devices which include location hardware and support Android 4.1.x or higher.





Required: Configure Project Settings

For the Parkour Method framework to work, add the “ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION”, “INTERNET”, “ACCESS_WIFI_STATE”, “CHANGE_WIFI_STATE”, and “WAKE_LOCK”  permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml file.
Java

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />

Add our Service “PKBackground” to your AndroidManifest.xml file, so our SDK will work in the background.
Java

<service android:name="com.parkourmethod.parkour.PKBackground"
  android:enabled="true"
  android:process=":PK_background"
  android:exported="false"/>

Add the latest build of Google Play Services to your projects build.gradle dependencies section.
Java

dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:8.4.0'
}

This is necessary to obtain advertising information through Google Play Services. The enterprise version of the Parkour Method framework does not require this. If you or your team are interested in an enterprise usage of our framework, please contact us at team@parkourmethod.com.



Required: Add Parkour Framework

To add the Parkour Method framework to your project, first create a folder titled “libs” within the “app” directory of your project. Then add Parkour.jar to this new folder.





Then right-click on Parkour.jar and select “Add as library”. Check your build.gradle file and make sure “compile files(‘libs/Parkour.jar’)” is under dependencies.
Java

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:8.4.0'
    compile files('libs/Parkour.jar')
}

After you’ve made sure the Parkour library has been added as a dependency, click on the “Sync Projects with Gradle Files” button at the top of your Android Studio toolbar. This will remove any errors and finish up the integration process.



Required: Integrate Parkour into your Class
Integrate our Framework into your class that will call and process your location data.

To finish integrating the Parkour framework into your app, import the main Parkour class and both our Venue and Location listener classes. Add these to the class that you would like to utilize our framework with.
Java

import com.parkourmethod.parkour.Listeners.OnLocationChangeListener;
import com.parkourmethod.parkour.Listeners.OnVenueChangeListener;
import com.parkourmethod.parkour.Parkour;

Then make sure your class extends our Parkour class, ignored to call the appropriate methods and receive location or nearest venue updates. Such as this:
Java

public class YourActivity extends Parkour {

The parkourStart() method will activate our framework. It will run in the background and provide you location and venue updates. Place this command within the OnStart() method of the class that extends Parkour, for best results. You can also call parkourStart() later in your code. If you are targeting Android Marshmallow (API 23) or later, you need to request and confirm the fine location permission, before starting our SDK or you will receive no location updates.
Java

parkourStart();

Congrats! The Parkour Method framework is now fully integrated into you project. Now let’s look at methods you can add to control our SDK and receive location and venue updates.



Get Location Update
Receive location updates from the Parkour Method Framework

Java

 pkListener.setOnLocationChangeListener(new OnLocationChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public void onLocationChanged(Location newLoc, String motionType, String positionType) {
                Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Arrived here: " + newLoc + " motion: " + motionType + " position: " + positionType);
            }
        });


Since your class extends the main Parkour class, we can directly call its location listener, pkListener, and it’s setOnLocationChangeListener method. This will provide you accurate location updates. In our initial default mode, your will receive location updates every 30 seconds to 2 minutes. The location listener returns a location object, a string defining motion type, and a string defining position type. Motion Types

pkmNotMoving
pkmWalking
pkmRunning
pkmCycling
pkmDriving
pkmFlying

Position Types

pkmOutdoors
pkmIndoors.


Java

parkourSetInterval(int seconds);

The pkSetInterval method will set the max number of seconds it will take to receive a location update. It’s best to set this up before calling the pkstart() command, but will take affect once the SDK goes through it’s default loop if you call it later. Our default system returns a location update between every 30 seconds and 2 minutes. If you need a more specific timeframe, use pkSetInterval to control that. This will increase your battery burn rate depending on location call frequency. To return to default mode, call pkSetInterval with 0 as the seconds value.



Get POI/Venue Updates
Receive Venue/POI updates from the Parkour Method Framework

Java

pkVenListener.setOnVenueChangeListener(new OnVenueChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public void onVenueChanged(String ven, String add, String catOne, String catTwo, double dist, Location userLoc) {
                Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Venue: " + ven);
            }
        });


Since your class extends the main Parkour class, we can directly call its venue listener, pkVenListener, and it’s setOnVenueChangeListener method. This will provide you with updates on the nearest venue your users are at (up to 25 meters away), when our system detects them indoors.

ven (String) – name of the venue
add (String) – full address of the venue
catOne (String) – first category the venue falls under
catTwo (String) – second category the venue falls under
dist (double) – the distance the user is from the venue





Code Example
A full example of how to setup your class to work with the Parkour Method framework

This example code will operate our SDK in default mode and return both location and venue updates.
Java

package com.parkourmethod.testproject3;

import android.location.Location;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;

import com.parkourmethod.parkour.Listeners.OnLocationChangeListener;
import com.parkourmethod.parkour.Listeners.OnVenueChangeListener;
import com.parkourmethod.parkour.Parkour;

public class YourActivity extends Parkour{

    private final String LOG_TAG="TestProject";

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        pkListener.setOnLocationChangeListener(new OnLocationChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public void onLocationChanged(Location newLoc, String motionType, String positionType) {
                Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Arrived here: " + newLoc + " motion: " + motionType + " position: " + positionType);
            }
        });

        pkVenListener.setOnVenueChangeListener(new OnVenueChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public void onVenueChanged(String ven, String add, String catOne, String catTwo, double dist, Location userLoc) {
                Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Venue: " + ven);
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        parkourStart();
    }


}

Your output will look like this:
Java

Arrived here: Location[ 38.903981,-77.063308 acc=30 t=?!? et=?!? alt=0.0 vel=0.0 bear=0.0] motion: pkmNotMoving position: pkmIndoors

  Frequently Asked Questions


General Questions
[bg_faq_start]
Why should I use Parkour Method?
Optimizing and customizing location services is never simple. Parkour Method makes it easy to build robust location-powered apps. Our SDK is designed to provide maximal accuracy, battery-life, and location context without the work (and without the cost of traditional services). Why rebuild the wheel? Get back to focusing on the core product features your users care about. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What kinds of apps use Parkour Method?
We’re currently having strong success within the following app verticals: retail/brand specific apps, social-location services, deals & coupons, ride-sharing, navigation, and fitness. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
How do you compare with Apple & Android’s location services?
Stock location managers (Apple & Android) drain battery from 8-33% per hour for continuous updates. Our SDK optimizes battery life, consuming less than 0.5% per hour in our default always-on mode & 1.5% for our fitness mode (which provides the developer more frequent location updates). Stock location managers’ (Apple & Android) accuracy for GPS informed location ranges from 10-100 meters of accuracy. Our current accuracy ranges from 2m – 15m, depending on environmental conditions (e.g. proximity/height of buildings, weather conditions, wifi/cell reception, etc. all have an impact). [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
Does the Parkour Method SDK work internationally?
The Parkour Method SDK works globally, however address and business data is only provided in the US. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
Do I have to replace my existing location implementation?
No, the Parkour Method SDK can be used in parallel to an existing location implementation, or as a full replacement to gain maximum location accuracy and energy savings. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What platforms are supported?
We support iOS (8.0 and up) and Android Kit Kat (4.4) and up. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What does the Parkour Method SDK cost?
The Parkour Method SDK is offered free for all developers. No restrictions on userbase size or number of auto-checkins. For enterprise support or private-label options, please contact us for details. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
How much data does your SDK use?
Location data processing is done locally on the mobile device, drastically reducing data consumption from network heavy approaches like that of geo-fencing. [bg_faq_end]


Feature Details
[bg_faq_start]
Does the Parkour Method SDK run in the background?
Yes – the Parkour Method SDK runs continuously in the background, providing you the full-picture of how your users interact with the real-world. Continuous operation keeps the GPS ‘warm’, allowing you to offer your users immediate location precision when you need it. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
Does your SDK work indoors & outdoors? GPS is our primary signal and its accuracy drops dramatically indoors. As such, our SDK is recommended for outdoor use. Stay tuned for future versions – Bluetooth integration coming soon. [bg_faq_end]
[bg_faq_start]
How many meters of accuracy are you?
While we have yet to complete official testing, our current measurements are within 5 meters RMSE. In real-world conditions, this ranges from 2 meters to 15 meters in the worst urban canyons. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
How long does it take to trigger an automatic check-in?
Automatic check-ins (‘verified indoors’ points) are generally produced 2-5 minutes after entrance into a venue. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What is ‘verified indoors’?
‘Verified Indoors’ location points represent passive check-ins. Our prioritary algorithms analyze fluctuations in device signals to identify the users’ surrounding environment. Once we have a high level of confidence that the device has moved indoors, this triggers a snap-to venue event. [bg_faq_end]


Venue Data
[bg_faq_start]
How many venues does your database support?
Our venue database currently supports over 2.5MM locations across the following verticals: retail, dining, travel, & education. We boast comprehensive coverage of major chains, established local businesses and points of interest; enhancements added weekly. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What differentiates your venue database from Foursquare, Google Places, Apple Maps?
We aggregate business data across sources and utilize proprietary algorithms to correct the location points of these businesses. Additionally, ensure business details are up-to-date, while applying our own meaningful, consumer-oriented categorization. [bg_faq_end]


Privacy
[bg_faq_start]
What do you require us to disclose to our users?
A subset of user location data is automatically transferred to Parkour Method to provide you insights about your users. Any data transferred to third parties, including data transferred to Parkour Method, should be disclosed in your app’s privacy policy. Your privacy policy should be transparent about the data you collect and how you utilize this data. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What data does Parkour Method collect?
Initial location information (e.g. latlon, neighborhood, city, state, etc.), device information (e.g. IDFA, OS), app id, & SDK version as well as a few location points per day. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
How do you protect consumer privacy?
Parkour Method takes measures to protect user data by anonymizing identifying data and restricting the types of places returned when using automatic venue updates. Sensitive location data (home, medical, legal, etc) is only stored on the device. Additionally, users can always opt-out of data sharing with Parkour Method directly by limiting ad tracking. For iOS, go to your Settings > Select Privacy > Select Advertising > Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. For Android, Open your Google Settings app > Ads > Enable “Opt out of interest-based advertising”. [bg_faq_end]

Our Mission

Obtaining high quality location, without killing the user’s battery, is hard. And the effort required to make sense of that data can require a team of data scientists, a massive data center, and a lot of money. Parkour Method’s mission is to free developers from the complexity of location technology- to ultimately enable more personalized user experiences.



We believe in the one-click hail: that your phone should tell you your pickup location, not the other way around.
We believe you shouldn’t have to specify preferences to a ‘smart’phone.
We believe a phone charger should only be used once a day.
We believe discovery should feel organic.
We believe, if equipped with easy-to-use, high performance, and context-smart location tech, developers will bring our intuitions to life.

Our Map Data

Ever experience walking directions which sent you to the wrong side of the building on 56th St? Or request a car only to have the driver arrive across the street or around the corner from you?  It’s due to poor quality address coordinate mapping. Address lat/lons have traditionally been mapped using a ‘street interpolation’ or ‘building centroid’ method which offers mapping accuracy within 1/2 – 1 block of an address. In NYC, where city blocks can be three times larger than in smaller cities, address coordinates can be as much as 500 feet off. Check out your favorite map provider wherever you are right now and you’ll find business listings and residences far from their actual locations, or address coordinates located in the wrong buildings or the middle of a street. This can be frustrating for you and for your customers.

Getting the right address coordinate is as important as getting the right address. It’s crucial when you’re checking into a restaurant, requesting a car pickup or if you’re providing directions to a store.

At Parkour Method, our objective is to map our address coordinates within feet of their actual building entrances. Our patent-pending process uses a combination of historical user location data and proprietary spatial analysis tools, offering corrected address coordinates for > 96.5% of metropolitan addresses, and 90% of rural/suburban areas. Each Parkour address coordinate targeted for location within feet of a building entrance, with few exceptions.  Of course maps are best presented visually — check out our latest maps:
Washington, DC Area
Silicon Valley, CA
San Francisco, CA
We’ve nearly completed remapping the US residential and commercial address space, and by September 2016 we’ll have remapped key international metropolitan areas, too. As you’re browsing through our maps, you may notice small pockets of address data which seems to be a bit off — that’s our 3.5% error rate which places addresses several meters away from their intended locations (and congrats on having a detailed eye!) We’re working on these so watch for improvements every week.

If you use the Parkour location framework for iOS or Android, our remapped data set powers your app today. For specialized geocoding/reverse geocoding or mapping applications, please contact us at team@parkourmethod.com.

  Frequently Asked Questions


General Questions
[bg_faq_start]
Why should I use Parkour Method?
Optimizing and customizing location services is never simple. Parkour Method makes it easy to build robust location-powered apps. Our SDK is designed to provide maximal accuracy, battery-life, and location context without the work (and without the cost of traditional services). Why rebuild the wheel? Get back to focusing on the core product features your users care about. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What kinds of apps use Parkour Method?
We’re currently having strong success within the following app verticals: retail/brand specific apps, social-location services, deals & coupons, ride-sharing, navigation, and fitness. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
How do you compare with Apple & Android’s location services?
Stock location managers (Apple & Android) drain battery from 8-33% per hour for continuous updates. Our SDK optimizes battery life, consuming less than 0.5% per hour in our default always-on mode & 1.5% for our fitness mode (which provides the developer more frequent location updates). Stock location managers’ (Apple & Android) accuracy for GPS informed location ranges from 10-100 meters of accuracy. Our current accuracy ranges from 2m – 15m, depending on environmental conditions (e.g. proximity/height of buildings, weather conditions, wifi/cell reception, etc. all have an impact). [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
Does the Parkour Method SDK work internationally?
The Parkour Method SDK works globally, however address and business data is only provided in the US. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
Do I have to replace my existing location implementation?
No, the Parkour Method SDK can be used in parallel to an existing location implementation, or as a full replacement to gain maximum location accuracy and energy savings. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What platforms are supported?
We support iOS (8.0 and up) and Android Kit Kat (4.4) and up. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What does the Parkour Method SDK cost?
The Parkour Method SDK is offered free for all developers. No restrictions on userbase size or number of auto-checkins. For enterprise support or private-label options, please contact us for details. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
How much data does your SDK use?
Location data processing is done locally on the mobile device, drastically reducing data consumption from network heavy approaches like that of geo-fencing. [bg_faq_end]


Feature Details
[bg_faq_start]
Does the Parkour Method SDK run in the background?
Yes – the Parkour Method SDK runs continuously in the background, providing you the full-picture of how your users interact with the real-world. Continuous operation keeps the GPS ‘warm’, allowing you to offer your users immediate location precision when you need it. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
Does your SDK work indoors & outdoors? GPS is our primary signal and its accuracy drops dramatically indoors. As such, our SDK is recommended for outdoor use. Stay tuned for future versions – Bluetooth integration coming soon. [bg_faq_end]
[bg_faq_start]
How many meters of accuracy are you?
While we have yet to complete official testing, our current measurements are within 5 meters RMSE. In real-world conditions, this ranges from 2 meters to 15 meters in the worst urban canyons. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
How long does it take to trigger an automatic check-in?
Automatic check-ins (‘verified indoors’ points) are generally produced 2-5 minutes after entrance into a venue. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What is ‘verified indoors’?
‘Verified Indoors’ location points represent passive check-ins. Our prioritary algorithms analyze fluctuations in device signals to identify the users’ surrounding environment. Once we have a high level of confidence that the device has moved indoors, this triggers a snap-to venue event. [bg_faq_end]


Venue Data
[bg_faq_start]
How many venues does your database support?
Our venue database currently supports over 2.5MM locations across the following verticals: retail, dining, travel, & education. We boast comprehensive coverage of major chains, established local businesses and points of interest; enhancements added weekly. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What differentiates your venue database from Foursquare, Google Places, Apple Maps?
We aggregate business data across sources and utilize proprietary algorithms to correct the location points of these businesses. Additionally, ensure business details are up-to-date, while applying our own meaningful, consumer-oriented categorization. [bg_faq_end]


Privacy
[bg_faq_start]
What do you require us to disclose to our users?
A subset of user location data is automatically transferred to Parkour Method to provide you insights about your users. Any data transferred to third parties, including data transferred to Parkour Method, should be disclosed in your app’s privacy policy. Your privacy policy should be transparent about the data you collect and how you utilize this data. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
What data does Parkour Method collect?
Initial location information (e.g. latlon, neighborhood, city, state, etc.), device information (e.g. IDFA, OS), app id, & SDK version as well as a few location points per day. [bg_faq_end] [bg_faq_start]
How do you protect consumer privacy?
Parkour Method takes measures to protect user data by anonymizing identifying data and restricting the types of places returned when using automatic venue updates. Sensitive location data (home, medical, legal, etc) is only stored on the device. Additionally, users can always opt-out of data sharing with Parkour Method directly by limiting ad tracking. For iOS, go to your Settings > Select Privacy > Select Advertising > Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. For Android, Open your Google Settings app > Ads > Enable “Opt out of interest-based advertising”. [bg_faq_end]

Parkour (French pronunciation: ​[paʁkuʁ]) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.[4][5][6] Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement, and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.[7][8] Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.
Parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces.[9][10] Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.[11][12]
Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s.[13][14] The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.[4]

Etymology[edit]
The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant, the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by Georges Hébert.[15][16][17] Raymond Belle used the term "le parcours" to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement.[18] His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming "parkour".[19]
A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse.[7] They are nouns derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in reference to drawing.[20] The verb tracer used familiarly means: "to buck up".[21] The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.[22]
A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.
History[edit]
Georges Hébert[edit]
In Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was French naval officer Georges Hébert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa.[23] He noted, "their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature."[23] His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Saint-Pierre, Martinique, reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism.[23] Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. Hébert set up a "méthode naturelle" (natural method) session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence, swimming. These were intended to develop "the three main forces": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath).[24] During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a "parcours du combattant"[25]—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses.[23]
Raymond and David Belle[edit]
Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.[4][26][27]




David Belle is considered the founder of parkour.


Raymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings[which?] that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.[4][18]
Through conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called "parcours". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.[18]

David initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.[1] The group eventually included David Belle, Sébastien Foucan, Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière.
Discipline[edit]
The group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.[28] For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.[29] During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.[30] At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.[31]
Respecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.[29]
Humility was an important principle.[31] No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.[29]
To join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.[30] Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently — "to create the means to be yourself"[32] — and there was a complete trust within the group.[31] Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.[33] If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.[34]
Name and split[edit]
In 1997, David Belle's brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris.[35] For the performance, the group named themselves Yamakasi—Congolese Lingala ya makási, meaning strong in one's person, or "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: "l'art du déplacement" (French for "the art of movement").[35] The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name "parkour" to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term l'art du déplacement [4][36] (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).
Organisations[edit]
National parkour organisations include Apex School of Movement (United States), Fédération de Parkour (France), Jump freerun (Netherlands), Parkour UK, Parkour and Tricking Sweden, Australian Parkour Association and New Zealand Parkour Association.
International parkout organisations include the Mouvement International du Parkour, Freerunning et l'Art du Déplacement, the Fédération Internationale des Arts Du Déplacement, and the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it "to be alive" and "for people to use it".[37] Châu Belle explains it is a "type of freedom" or "kind of expression"; that parkour is "only a state of mind" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers.[37] Traceur Dylan Baker says, "Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles".[37][38][39] A study by Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.[40]
Academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.[41]
A newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of "human reclamation".[42] Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as "a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it."[42] Another traceur[who?] writes, "It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour."[43]
Competition[edit]
A campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry.[44][45] In the words of Erwan Le Corre: "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore."[44] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'"[46] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.[citation needed]
David Belle[edit]
In his 2009 book "Parkour", David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better."[47] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else."[48]
The philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts.[49] In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?".[25] In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before."[50] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one."[51]
Belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, "Precision is all about being measured," and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.[52] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times."[48] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.
Practice[edit]
Movement[edit]

While there is no official list of "moves" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others,[8] and there are a number of movements considered fundamental.[5] Some examples of common movements are:[53][54]

Vaulting over obstacles.
Jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles.
Jumping and landing feet-first on a vertical surface, catching the horizontal top with the hands.[55]
Using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops.
Running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall.
Moving from a position hanging from a wall-top or ledge, to standing on the top or over to the other side.

Equipment[edit]

Parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing.[56][57] Traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback.[58][59] Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps.[60] Barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, "bare feet are the best shoes."[61] Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour.[62]
Risks[edit]
Trespassing[edit]

Parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom.[63] Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property,[64] and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries.[65] Many parkour organizations around the globe support the Leave No Trace initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit Parkour Visions in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.[66][67][68][69][70]
Injuries and deaths[edit]
Concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings.[71] They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops.[64][72][73] Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.[72][74][75][76]
Because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task."[77] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.[78]
American traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare "because participants rely not on what they can't control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet," but Lanier Johnson, executive director of the American Sports Medicine Institute, noted that many of the injuries are not reported.[79]
Impact[edit]
Initially featured in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One station trailer Rush Hour. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme,[80] and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used.[81] This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.[5][82]
The creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is very common in the parkour community.[4][36] Jump London is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their parkour skills. Jump London changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs.[41] It was followed by Jump Britain in 2005. The Australian version of 60 Minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.[83]
Parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, which has been particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation.[84] For example, in 2010 The New York Times published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community.[85] In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.[86]
Entertainment[edit]
Parkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers. The first director to do so was Luc Besson, for the film Taxi 2 in 1998, followed by Yamakasi in 2001 featuring members of the original Yamakasi group, and its sequel Les fils du vent in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote District 13, another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli,[87][88] followed by the sequel District 13: Ultimatum in 2009 and remade in English as Brick Mansions in 2014. In 2006 the film Casino Royale featured Sébastien Foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie, sparking renewed media interest in parkour.[25] Along with The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Casino Royale is credited with starting a new wave of Parkour-inspired stunts in Western film and television.[89] Parkour was prominent in Live Free or Die Hard (2007),[90] again with stuntman/actor Cyril Raffaelli, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), choreographed by David Belle.[91] Several films besides Yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour, such as Breaking and Entering (2006),[87][88] Run (2013),[92] and Tracers (2015). The 2011 film Freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival. Parkour also featured in Dhoom 3 (2013).[93]
MTV's show Ultimate Parkour Challenge premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.[94]
Actor Stephen Amell learned parkour at Tempest Academy in preparation for his role as Oliver Queen in the television series Arrow.[95] One of his co-stars on Arrow, Caity Lotz, is also a practitioner.[96]
Modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The Assassin's Creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game).[97][98][99] The Mirror's Edge games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles.[100][101] Brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter.[102] Prince of Persia and Dying Light include a central parkour mechanic,[103][104] while Crackdown and Crackdown 2 include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects.[105] Tony Hawk's American Wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard.[106] Tron Evolution's basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.[107]
Military training[edit]
Although parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training,[4][26] it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film Casino Royale, military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Army Corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to Corps soldiers.[108] Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military[109] and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in parkour.[110]
Derivative terminologies and disciplines[edit]
In September 2003, the documentary Jump London, starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term "freerunning" was used as an attempt to translate "parkour", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience.[111] Foucan decided to keep using the term "freerunning" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.[112][113]
The remaining seven Yamakasi members continued to use the term "l'art du déplacement", also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, l'art du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term "parkour", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.[113]
Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression.[112] Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.[114]

Parkour (French pronunciation: ​[paʁkuʁ]) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.[4][5][6] Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement, and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.[7][8] Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.
Parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces.[9][10] Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.[11][12]
Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s.[13][14] The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.[4]

Etymology[edit]
The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant, the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by Georges Hébert.[15][16][17] Raymond Belle used the term "le parcours" to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement.[18] His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming "parkour".[19]
A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse.[7] They are nouns derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in reference to drawing.[20] The verb tracer used familiarly means: "to buck up".[21] The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.[22]
A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.
History[edit]
Georges Hébert[edit]
In Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was French naval officer Georges Hébert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa.[23] He noted, "their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature."[23] His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Saint-Pierre, Martinique, reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism.[23] Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. Hébert set up a "méthode naturelle" (natural method) session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence, swimming. These were intended to develop "the three main forces": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath).[24] During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a "parcours du combattant"[25]—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses.[23]
Raymond and David Belle[edit]
Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.[4][26][27]




David Belle is considered the founder of parkour.


Raymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings[which?] that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.[4][18]
Through conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called "parcours". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.[18]
Yamakasi[edit]
Main article: Yamakasi
David initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.[1] The group eventually included David Belle, Sébastien Foucan, Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière.
Discipline[edit]
The group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.[28] For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.[29] During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.[30] At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.[31]
Respecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.[29]
Humility was an important principle.[31] No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.[29]
To join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.[30] Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently — "to create the means to be yourself"[32] — and there was a complete trust within the group.[31] Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.[33] If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.[34]
Name and split[edit]
In 1997, David Belle's brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris.[35] For the performance, the group named themselves Yamakasi—Congolese Lingala ya makási, meaning strong in one's person, or "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: "l'art du déplacement" (French for "the art of movement").[35] The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name "parkour" to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term l'art du déplacement [4][36] (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).
Organisations[edit]
National parkour organisations include Apex School of Movement (United States), Fédération de Parkour (France), Jump freerun (Netherlands), Parkour UK, Parkour and Tricking Sweden, Australian Parkour Association and New Zealand Parkour Association.
International parkout organisations include the Mouvement International du Parkour, Freerunning et l'Art du Déplacement, the Fédération Internationale des Arts Du Déplacement, and the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it "to be alive" and "for people to use it".[37] Châu Belle explains it is a "type of freedom" or "kind of expression"; that parkour is "only a state of mind" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers.[37] Traceur Dylan Baker says, "Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles".[37][38][39] A study by Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.[40]
Academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.[41]
A newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of "human reclamation".[42] Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as "a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it."[42] Another traceur[who?] writes, "It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour."[43]
Competition[edit]
A campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry.[44][45] In the words of Erwan Le Corre: "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore."[44] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'"[46] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.[citation needed]
David Belle[edit]
In his 2009 book "Parkour", David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better."[47] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else."[48]
The philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts.[49] In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?".[25] In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before."[50] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one."[51]
Belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, "Precision is all about being measured," and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.[52] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times."[48] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.
Practice[edit]
Movement[edit]

While there is no official list of "moves" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others,[8] and there are a number of movements considered fundamental.[5] Some examples of common movements are:[53][54]

Vaulting over obstacles.
Jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles.
Jumping and landing feet-first on a vertical surface, catching the horizontal top with the hands.[55]
Using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops.
Running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall.
Moving from a position hanging from a wall-top or ledge, to standing on the top or over to the other side.

Equipment[edit]

Parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing.[56][57] Traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback.[58][59] Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps.[60] Barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, "bare feet are the best shoes."[61] Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour.[62]
Risks[edit]
Trespassing[edit]

Parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom.[63] Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property,[64] and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries.[65] Many parkour organizations around the globe support the Leave No Trace initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit Parkour Visions in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.[66][67][68][69][70]
Injuries and deaths[edit]
Concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings.[71] They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops.[64][72][73] Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.[72][74][75][76]
Because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task."[77] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.[78]
American traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare "because participants rely not on what they can't control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet," but Lanier Johnson, executive director of the American Sports Medicine Institute, noted that many of the injuries are not reported.[79]
Impact[edit]
Initially featured in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One station trailer Rush Hour. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme,[80] and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used.[81] This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.[5][82]
The creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is very common in the parkour community.[4][36] Jump London is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their parkour skills. Jump London changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs.[41] It was followed by Jump Britain in 2005. The Australian version of 60 Minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.[83]
Parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, which has been particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation.[84] For example, in 2010 The New York Times published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community.[85] In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.[86]
Entertainment[edit]
Parkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers. The first director to do so was Luc Besson, for the film Taxi 2 in 1998, followed by Yamakasi in 2001 featuring members of the original Yamakasi group, and its sequel Les fils du vent in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote District 13, another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli,[87][88] followed by the sequel District 13: Ultimatum in 2009 and remade in English as Brick Mansions in 2014. In 2006 the film Casino Royale featured Sébastien Foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie, sparking renewed media interest in parkour.[25] Along with The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Casino Royale is credited with starting a new wave of Parkour-inspired stunts in Western film and television.[89] Parkour was prominent in Live Free or Die Hard (2007),[90] again with stuntman/actor Cyril Raffaelli, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), choreographed by David Belle.[91] Several films besides Yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour, such as Breaking and Entering (2006),[87][88] Run (2013),[92] and Tracers (2015). The 2011 film Freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival. Parkour also featured in Dhoom 3 (2013).[93]
MTV's show Ultimate Parkour Challenge premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.[94]
Actor Stephen Amell learned parkour at Tempest Academy in preparation for his role as Oliver Queen in the television series Arrow.[95] One of his co-stars on Arrow, Caity Lotz, is also a practitioner.[96]
Modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The Assassin's Creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game).[97][98][99] The Mirror's Edge games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles.[100][101] Brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter.[102] Prince of Persia and Dying Light include a central parkour mechanic,[103][104] while Crackdown and Crackdown 2 include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects.[105] Tony Hawk's American Wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard.[106] Tron Evolution's basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.[107]
Military training[edit]
Although parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training,[4][26] it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film Casino Royale, military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Army Corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to Corps soldiers.[108] Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military[109] and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in parkour.[110]
Derivative terminologies and disciplines[edit]
In September 2003, the documentary Jump London, starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term "freerunning" was used as an attempt to translate "parkour", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience.[111] Foucan decided to keep using the term "freerunning" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.[112][113]
The remaining seven Yamakasi members continued to use the term "l'art du déplacement", also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, l'art du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term "parkour", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.[113]
Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression.[112] Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.[114]

Parkour (French pronunciation: ​[paʁkuʁ]) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.[4][5][6] Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement, and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.[7][8] Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.
Parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces.[9][10] Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.[11][12]
Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s.[13][14] The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.[4]

Etymology[edit]
The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant, the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by Georges Hébert.[15][16][17] Raymond Belle used the term "le parcours" to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement.[18] His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming "parkour".[19]
A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse.[7] They are nouns derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in reference to drawing.[20] The verb tracer used familiarly means: "to buck up".[21] The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.[22]
A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.
History[edit]
Georges Hébert[edit]
In Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was French naval officer Georges Hébert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa.[23] He noted, "their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature."[23] His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Saint-Pierre, Martinique, reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism.[23] Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. Hébert set up a "méthode naturelle" (natural method) session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence, swimming. These were intended to develop "the three main forces": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath).[24] During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a "parcours du combattant"[25]—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses.[23]
Raymond and David Belle[edit]
Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.[4][26][27]




David Belle is considered the founder of parkour.


Raymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings[which?] that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.[4][18]
Through conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called "parcours". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.[18]
Yamakasi[edit]
Main article: Yamakasi
David initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.[1] The group eventually included David Belle, Sébastien Foucan, Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière.
Discipline[edit]
The group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.[28] For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.[29] During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.[30] At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.[31]
Respecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.[29]
Humility was an important principle.[31] No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.[29]
To join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.[30] Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently — "to create the means to be yourself"[32] — and there was a complete trust within the group.[31] Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.[33] If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.[34]
Name and split[edit]
In 1997, David Belle's brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris.[35] For the performance, the group named themselves Yamakasi—Congolese Lingala ya makási, meaning strong in one's person, or "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: "l'art du déplacement" (French for "the art of movement").[35] The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name "parkour" to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term l'art du déplacement [4][36] (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).
Organisations[edit]
National parkour organisations include Apex School of Movement (United States), Fédération de Parkour (France), Jump freerun (Netherlands), Parkour UK, Parkour and Tricking Sweden, Australian Parkour Association and New Zealand Parkour Association.
International parkout organisations include the Mouvement International du Parkour, Freerunning et l'Art du Déplacement, the Fédération Internationale des Arts Du Déplacement, and the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it "to be alive" and "for people to use it".[37] Châu Belle explains it is a "type of freedom" or "kind of expression"; that parkour is "only a state of mind" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers.[37] Traceur Dylan Baker says, "Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles".[37][38][39] A study by Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.[40]
Academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.[41]
A newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of "human reclamation".[42] Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as "a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it."[42] Another traceur[who?] writes, "It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour."[43]
Competition[edit]
A campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry.[44][45] In the words of Erwan Le Corre: "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore."[44] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'"[46] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.[citation needed]
David Belle[edit]
In his 2009 book "Parkour", David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better."[47] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else."[48]
The philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts.[49] In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?".[25] In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before."[50] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one."[51]
Belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, "Precision is all about being measured," and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.[52] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times."[48] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.
Practice[edit]
Movement[edit]

While there is no official list of "moves" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others,[8] and there are a number of movements considered fundamental.[5] Some examples of common movements are:[53][54]

Vaulting over obstacles.
Jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles.
Jumping and landing feet-first on a vertical surface, catching the horizontal top with the hands.[55]
Using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops.
Running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall.
Moving from a position hanging from a wall-top or ledge, to standing on the top or over to the other side.

Equipment[edit]

Parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing.[56][57] Traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback.[58][59] Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps.[60] Barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, "bare feet are the best shoes."[61] Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour.[62]
Risks[edit]
Trespassing[edit]

Parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom.[63] Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property,[64] and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries.[65] Many parkour organizations around the globe support the Leave No Trace initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit Parkour Visions in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.[66][67][68][69][70]
Injuries and deaths[edit]
Concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings.[71] They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops.[64][72][73] Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.[72][74][75][76]
Because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task."[77] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.[78]
American traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare "because participants rely not on what they can't control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet," but Lanier Johnson, executive director of the American Sports Medicine Institute, noted that many of the injuries are not reported.[79]
Impact[edit]
Initially featured in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One station trailer Rush Hour. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme,[80] and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used.[81] This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.[5][82]
The creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is very common in the parkour community.[4][36] Jump London is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their parkour skills. Jump London changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs.[41] It was followed by Jump Britain in 2005. The Australian version of 60 Minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.[83]
Parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, which has been particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation.[84] For example, in 2010 The New York Times published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community.[85] In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.[86]
Entertainment[edit]
Parkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers. The first director to do so was Luc Besson, for the film Taxi 2 in 1998, followed by Yamakasi in 2001 featuring members of the original Yamakasi group, and its sequel Les fils du vent in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote District 13, another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli,[87][88] followed by the sequel District 13: Ultimatum in 2009 and remade in English as Brick Mansions in 2014. In 2006 the film Casino Royale featured Sébastien Foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie, sparking renewed media interest in parkour.[25] Along with The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Casino Royale is credited with starting a new wave of Parkour-inspired stunts in Western film and television.[89] Parkour was prominent in Live Free or Die Hard (2007),[90] again with stuntman/actor Cyril Raffaelli, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), choreographed by David Belle.[91] Several films besides Yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour, such as Breaking and Entering (2006),[87][88] Run (2013),[92] and Tracers (2015). The 2011 film Freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival. Parkour also featured in Dhoom 3 (2013).[93]
MTV's show Ultimate Parkour Challenge premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.[94]
Actor Stephen Amell learned parkour at Tempest Academy in preparation for his role as Oliver Queen in the television series Arrow.[95] One of his co-stars on Arrow, Caity Lotz, is also a practitioner.[96]
Modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The Assassin's Creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game).[97][98][99] The Mirror's Edge games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles.[100][101] Brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter.[102] Prince of Persia and Dying Light include a central parkour mechanic,[103][104] while Crackdown and Crackdown 2 include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects.[105] Tony Hawk's American Wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard.[106] Tron Evolution's basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.[107]
Military training[edit]
Although parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training,[4][26] it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film Casino Royale, military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Army Corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to Corps soldiers.[108] Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military[109] and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in parkour.[110]
Derivative terminologies and disciplines[edit]
In September 2003, the documentary Jump London, starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term "freerunning" was used as an attempt to translate "parkour", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience.[111] Foucan decided to keep using the term "freerunning" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.[112][113]
The remaining seven Yamakasi members continued to use the term "l'art du déplacement", also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, l'art du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term "parkour", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.[113]
Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression.[112] Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.[114]

Parkour (French pronunciation: ​[paʁkuʁ]) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.[4][5][6] Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement, and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.[7][8] Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.
Parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces.[9][10] Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.[11][12]
Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s.[13][14] The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.[4]

Etymology[edit]
The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant, the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by Georges Hébert.[15][16][17] Raymond Belle used the term "le parcours" to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement.[18] His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming "parkour".[19]
A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse.[7] They are nouns derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in reference to drawing.[20] The verb tracer used familiarly means: "to buck up".[21] The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.[22]
A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.
History[edit]
Georges Hébert[edit]
In Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was French naval officer Georges Hébert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa.[23] He noted, "their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature."[23] His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Saint-Pierre, Martinique, reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism.[23] Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. Hébert set up a "méthode naturelle" (natural method) session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence, swimming. These were intended to develop "the three main forces": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath).[24] During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a "parcours du combattant"[25]—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses.[23]
Raymond and David Belle[edit]
Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.[4][26][27]




David Belle is considered the founder of parkour.


Raymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings[which?] that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.[4][18]
Through conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called "parcours". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.[18]
Yamakasi[edit]
Main article: Yamakasi
David initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.[1] The group eventually included David Belle, Sébastien Foucan, Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière.
Discipline[edit]
The group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.[28] For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.[29] During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.[30] At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.[31]
Respecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.[29]
Humility was an important principle.[31] No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.[29]
To join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.[30] Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently — "to create the means to be yourself"[32] — and there was a complete trust within the group.[31] Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.[33] If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.[34]
Name and split[edit]
In 1997, David Belle's brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris.[35] For the performance, the group named themselves Yamakasi—Congolese Lingala ya makási, meaning strong in one's person, or "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: "l'art du déplacement" (French for "the art of movement").[35] The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name "parkour" to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term l'art du déplacement [4][36] (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).
Organisations[edit]
National parkour organisations include Apex School of Movement (United States), Fédération de Parkour (France), Jump freerun (Netherlands), Parkour UK, Parkour and Tricking Sweden, Australian Parkour Association and New Zealand Parkour Association.
International parkout organisations include the Mouvement International du Parkour, Freerunning et l'Art du Déplacement, the Fédération Internationale des Arts Du Déplacement, and the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it "to be alive" and "for people to use it".[37] Châu Belle explains it is a "type of freedom" or "kind of expression"; that parkour is "only a state of mind" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers.[37] Traceur Dylan Baker says, "Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles".[37][38][39] A study by Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.[40]
Academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.[41]
A newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of "human reclamation".[42] Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as "a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it."[42] Another traceur[who?] writes, "It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour."[43]
Competition[edit]
A campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry.[44][45] In the words of Erwan Le Corre: "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore."[44] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'"[46] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.[citation needed]
David Belle[edit]
In his 2009 book "Parkour", David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better."[47] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else."[48]
The philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts.[49] In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?".[25] In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before."[50] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one."[51]
Belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, "Precision is all about being measured," and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.[52] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times."[48] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.

While there is no official list of "moves" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others,[8] and there are a number of movements considered fundamental.[5] Some examples of common movements are:[53][54]

Vaulting over obstacles.
Jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles.
Jumping and landing feet-first on a vertical surface, catching the horizontal top with the hands.[55]
Using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops.
Running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall.
Moving from a position hanging from a wall-top or ledge, to standing on the top or over to the other side.

Equipment[edit]

Parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing.[56][57] Traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback.[58][59] Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps.[60] Barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, "bare feet are the best shoes."[61] Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour.[62]
Risks[edit]
Trespassing[edit]

Parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom.[63] Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property,[64] and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries.[65] Many parkour organizations around the globe support the Leave No Trace initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit Parkour Visions in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.[66][67][68][69][70]
Injuries and deaths[edit]
Concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings.[71] They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops.[64][72][73] Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.[72][74][75][76]
Because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task."[77] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.[78]
American traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare "because participants rely not on what they can't control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet," but Lanier Johnson, executive director of the American Sports Medicine Institute, noted that many of the injuries are not reported.[79]
Impact[edit]
Initially featured in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One station trailer Rush Hour. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme,[80] and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used.[81] This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.[5][82]
The creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is very common in the parkour community.[4][36] Jump London is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their parkour skills. Jump London changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs.[41] It was followed by Jump Britain in 2005. The Australian version of 60 Minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.[83]
Parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, which has been particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation.[84] For example, in 2010 The New York Times published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community.[85] In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.[86]
Entertainment[edit]
Parkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers. The first director to do so was Luc Besson, for the film Taxi 2 in 1998, followed by Yamakasi in 2001 featuring members of the original Yamakasi group, and its sequel Les fils du vent in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote District 13, another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli,[87][88] followed by the sequel District 13: Ultimatum in 2009 and remade in English as Brick Mansions in 2014. In 2006 the film Casino Royale featured Sébastien Foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie, sparking renewed media interest in parkour.[25] Along with The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Casino Royale is credited with starting a new wave of Parkour-inspired stunts in Western film and television.[89] Parkour was prominent in Live Free or Die Hard (2007),[90] again with stuntman/actor Cyril Raffaelli, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), choreographed by David Belle.[91] Several films besides Yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour, such as Breaking and Entering (2006),[87][88] Run (2013),[92] and Tracers (2015). The 2011 film Freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival. Parkour also featured in Dhoom 3 (2013).[93]
MTV's show Ultimate Parkour Challenge premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.[94]
Actor Stephen Amell learned parkour at Tempest Academy in preparation for his role as Oliver Queen in the television series Arrow.[95] One of his co-stars on Arrow, Caity Lotz, is also a practitioner.[96]
Modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The Assassin's Creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game).[97][98][99] The Mirror's Edge games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles.[100][101] Brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter.[102] Prince of Persia and Dying Light include a central parkour mechanic,[103][104] while Crackdown and Crackdown 2 include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects.[105] Tony Hawk's American Wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard.[106] Tron Evolution's basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.[107]
Military training[edit]
Although parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training,[4][26] it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film Casino Royale, military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Army Corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to Corps soldiers.[108] Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military[109] and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in parkour.[110]
Derivative terminologies and disciplines[edit]
In September 2003, the documentary Jump London, starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term "freerunning" was used as an attempt to translate "parkour", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience.[111] Foucan decided to keep using the term "freerunning" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.[112][113]
The remaining seven Yamakasi members continued to use the term "l'art du déplacement", also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, l'art du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term "parkour", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.[113]
Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression.[112] Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.[114]

Parkour (French pronunciation: ​[paʁkuʁ]) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.[4][5][6] Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement, and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.[7][8] Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.
Parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces.[9][10] Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.[11][12]
Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s.[13][14] The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.[4]

Etymology[edit]
The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant, the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by Georges Hébert.[15][16][17] Raymond Belle used the term "le parcours" to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement.[18] His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming "parkour".[19]
A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse.[7] They are nouns derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in reference to drawing.[20] The verb tracer used familiarly means: "to buck up".[21] The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.[22]
A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.
History[edit]
Georges Hébert[edit]
In Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was French naval officer Georges Hébert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa.[23] He noted, "their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature."[23] His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Saint-Pierre, Martinique, reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism.[23] Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. Hébert set up a "méthode naturelle" (natural method) session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence, swimming. These were intended to develop "the three main forces": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath).[24] During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a "parcours du combattant"[25]—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses.[23]
Raymond and David Belle[edit]
Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.[4][26][27]




David Belle is considered the founder of parkour.


Raymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings[which?] that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.[4][18]
Through conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called "parcours". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.[18]
Yamakasi[edit]
Main article: Yamakasi
David initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.[1] The group eventually included David Belle, Sébastien Foucan, Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière.
Discipline[edit]
The group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.[28] For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.[29] During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.[30] At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.[31]
Respecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.[29]
Humility was an important principle.[31] No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.[29]
To join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.[30] Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently — "to create the means to be yourself"[32] — and there was a complete trust within the group.[31] Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.[33] If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.[34]
Name and split[edit]
In 1997, David Belle's brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris.[35] For the performance, the group named themselves Yamakasi—Congolese Lingala ya makási, meaning strong in one's person, or "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: "l'art du déplacement" (French for "the art of movement").[35] The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name "parkour" to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term l'art du déplacement [4][36] (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).
Organisations[edit]
National parkour organisations include Apex School of Movement (United States), Fédération de Parkour (France), Jump freerun (Netherlands), Parkour UK, Parkour and Tricking Sweden, Australian Parkour Association and New Zealand Parkour Association.
International parkout organisations include the Mouvement International du Parkour, Freerunning et l'Art du Déplacement, the Fédération Internationale des Arts Du Déplacement, and the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it "to be alive" and "for people to use it".[37] Châu Belle explains it is a "type of freedom" or "kind of expression"; that parkour is "only a state of mind" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers.[37] Traceur Dylan Baker says, "Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles".[37][38][39] A study by Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.[40]
Academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.[41]
A newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of "human reclamation".[42] Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as "a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it."[42] Another traceur[who?] writes, "It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour."[43]
Competition[edit]
A campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry.[44][45] In the words of Erwan Le Corre: "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore."[44] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'"[46] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.[citation needed]
David Belle[edit]
In his 2009 book "Parkour", David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better."[47] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else."[48]
The philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts.[49] In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?".[25] In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before."[50] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one."[51]
Belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, "Precision is all about being measured," and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.[52] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times."[48] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.
Practice[edit]
Movement[edit]

While there is no official list of "moves" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others,[8] and there are a number of movements considered fundamental.[5] Some examples of common movements are:[53][54]

Vaulting over obstacles.
Jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles.
Jumping and landing feet-first on a vertical surface, catching the horizontal top with the hands.[55]
Using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops.
Running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall.
Moving from a position hanging from a wall-top or ledge, to standing on the top or over to the other side.

Equipment[edit]

Parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing.[56][57] Traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback.[58][59] Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps.[60] Barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, "bare feet are the best shoes."[61] Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour.[62]
Risks[edit]
Trespassing[edit]

Parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom.[63] Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property,[64] and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries.[65] Many parkour organizations around the globe support the Leave No Trace initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit Parkour Visions in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.[66][67][68][69][70]
Injuries and deaths[edit]
Concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings.[71] They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops.[64][72][73] Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.[72][74][75][76]
Because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task."[77] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.[78]
American traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare "because participants rely not on what they can't control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet," but Lanier Johnson, executive director of the American Sports Medicine Institute, noted that many of the injuries are not reported.[79]
Impact[edit]
Initially featured in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One station trailer Rush Hour. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme,[80] and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used.[81] This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.[5][82]
The creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is very common in the parkour community.[4][36] Jump London is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their parkour skills. Jump London changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs.[41] It was followed by Jump Britain in 2005. The Australian version of 60 Minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.[83]
Parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, which has been particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation.[84] For example, in 2010 The New York Times published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community.[85] In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.[86]
Entertainment[edit]
Parkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers. The first director to do so was Luc Besson, for the film Taxi 2 in 1998, followed by Yamakasi in 2001 featuring members of the original Yamakasi group, and its sequel Les fils du vent in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote District 13, another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli,[87][88] followed by the sequel District 13: Ultimatum in 2009 and remade in English as Brick Mansions in 2014. In 2006 the film Casino Royale featured Sébastien Foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie, sparking renewed media interest in parkour.[25] Along with The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Casino Royale is credited with starting a new wave of Parkour-inspired stunts in Western film and television.[89] Parkour was prominent in Live Free or Die Hard (2007),[90] again with stuntman/actor Cyril Raffaelli, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), choreographed by David Belle.[91] Several films besides Yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour, such as Breaking and Entering (2006),[87][88] Run (2013),[92] and Tracers (2015). The 2011 film Freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival. Parkour also featured in Dhoom 3 (2013).[93]
MTV's show Ultimate Parkour Challenge premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.[94]
Actor Stephen Amell learned parkour at Tempest Academy in preparation for his role as Oliver Queen in the television series Arrow.[95] One of his co-stars on Arrow, Caity Lotz, is also a practitioner.[96]
Modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The Assassin's Creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game).[97][98][99] The Mirror's Edge games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles.[100][101] Brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter.[102] Prince of Persia and Dying Light include a central parkour mechanic,[103][104] while Crackdown and Crackdown 2 include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects.[105] Tony Hawk's American Wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard.[106] Tron Evolution's basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.[107]
Military training[edit]
Although parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training,[4][26] it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film Casino Royale, military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Army Corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to Corps soldiers.[108] Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military[109] and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in parkour.[110]
Derivative terminologies and disciplines[edit]
In September 2003, the documentary Jump London, starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term "freerunning" was used as an attempt to translate "parkour", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience.[111] Foucan decided to keep using the term "freerunning" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.[112][113]
The remaining seven Yamakasi members continued to use the term "l'art du déplacement", also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, l'art du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term "parkour", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.[113]
Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression.[112] Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.[114]

Parkour (French pronunciation: ​[paʁkuʁ]) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.[4][5][6] Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement, and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.[7][8] Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.
Parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces.[9][10] Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.[11][12]
Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s.[13][14] The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.[4]

Etymology[edit]
The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant, the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by Georges Hébert.[15][16][17] Raymond Belle used the term "le parcours" to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement.[18] His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming "parkour".[19]
A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse.[7] They are nouns derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in reference to drawing.[20] The verb tracer used familiarly means: "to buck up".[21] The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.[22]
A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.
History[edit]
Georges Hébert[edit]
In Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was French naval officer Georges Hébert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa.[23] He noted, "their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature."[23] His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Saint-Pierre, Martinique, reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism.[23] Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. Hébert set up a "méthode naturelle" (natural method) session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence, swimming. These were intended to develop "the three main forces": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath).[24] During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a "parcours du combattant"[25]—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses.[23]
Raymond and David Belle[edit]
Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.[4][26][27]




David Belle is considered the founder of parkour.


Raymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings[which?] that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.[4][18]
Through conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called "parcours". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.[18]
Yamakasi[edit]
Main article: Yamakasi
David initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.[1] The group eventually included David Belle, Sébastien Foucan, Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière.
Discipline[edit]
The group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.[28] For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.[29] During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.[30] At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.[31]
Respecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.[29]
Humility was an important principle.[31] No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.[29]
To join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.[30] Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently — "to create the means to be yourself"[32] — and there was a complete trust within the group.[31] Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.[33] If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.[34]
Name and split[edit]
In 1997, David Belle's brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris.[35] For the performance, the group named themselves Yamakasi—Congolese Lingala ya makási, meaning strong in one's person, or "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: "l'art du déplacement" (French for "the art of movement").[35] The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name "parkour" to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term l'art du déplacement [4][36] (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).
Organisations[edit]
National parkour organisations include Apex School of Movement (United States), Fédération de Parkour (France), Jump freerun (Netherlands), Parkour UK, Parkour and Tricking Sweden, Australian Parkour Association and New Zealand Parkour Association.
International parkout organisations include the Mouvement International du Parkour, Freerunning et l'Art du Déplacement, the Fédération Internationale des Arts Du Déplacement, and the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it "to be alive" and "for people to use it".[37] Châu Belle explains it is a "type of freedom" or "kind of expression"; that parkour is "only a state of mind" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers.[37] Traceur Dylan Baker says, "Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles".[37][38][39] A study by Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.[40]
Academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.[41]
A newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of "human reclamation".[42] Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as "a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it."[42] Another traceur[who?] writes, "It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour."[43]
Competition[edit]
A campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry.[44][45] In the words of Erwan Le Corre: "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore."[44] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'"[46] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.[citation needed]
David Belle[edit]
In his 2009 book "Parkour", David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better."[47] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else."[48]
The philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts.[49] In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?".[25] In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before."[50] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one."[51]
Belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, "Precision is all about being measured," and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.[52] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times."[48] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.
Practice[edit]
Movement[edit]

While there is no official list of "moves" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others,[8] and there are a number of movements considered fundamental.[5] Some examples of common movements are:[53][54]

Vaulting over obstacles.
Jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles.
Jumping and landing feet-first on a vertical surface, catching the horizontal top with the hands.[55]
Using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops.
Running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall.
Moving from a position hanging from a wall-top or ledge, to standing on the top or over to the other side.

Equipment[edit]

Parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing.[56][57] Traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback.[58][59] Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps.[60] Barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, "bare feet are the best shoes."[61] Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour.[62]
Risks[edit]
Trespassing[edit]

Parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom.[63] Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property,[64] and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries.[65] Many parkour organizations around the globe support the Leave No Trace initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit Parkour Visions in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.[66][67][68][69][70]
Injuries and deaths[edit]
Concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings.[71] They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops.[64][72][73] Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.[72][74][75][76]
Because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task."[77] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.[78]
American traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare "because participants rely not on what they can't control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet," but Lanier Johnson, executive director of the American Sports Medicine Institute, noted that many of the injuries are not reported.[79]
Impact[edit]
Initially featured in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One station trailer Rush Hour. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme,[80] and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used.[81] This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.[5][82]
The creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is very common in the parkour community.[4][36] Jump London is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their parkour skills. Jump London changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs.[41] It was followed by Jump Britain in 2005. The Australian version of 60 Minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.[83]
Parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, which has been particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation.[84] For example, in 2010 The New York Times published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community.[85] In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.[86]
Entertainment[edit]
Parkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers. The first director to do so was Luc Besson, for the film Taxi 2 in 1998, followed by Yamakasi in 2001 featuring members of the original Yamakasi group, and its sequel Les fils du vent in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote District 13, another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli,[87][88] followed by the sequel District 13: Ultimatum in 2009 and remade in English as Brick Mansions in 2014. In 2006 the film Casino Royale featured Sébastien Foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie, sparking renewed media interest in parkour.[25] Along with The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Casino Royale is credited with starting a new wave of Parkour-inspired stunts in Western film and television.[89] Parkour was prominent in Live Free or Die Hard (2007),[90] again with stuntman/actor Cyril Raffaelli, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), choreographed by David Belle.[91] Several films besides Yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour, such as Breaking and Entering (2006),[87][88] Run (2013),[92] and Tracers (2015). The 2011 film Freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival. Parkour also featured in Dhoom 3 (2013).[93]
MTV's show Ultimate Parkour Challenge premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.[94]
Actor Stephen Amell learned parkour at Tempest Academy in preparation for his role as Oliver Queen in the television series Arrow.[95] One of his co-stars on Arrow, Caity Lotz, is also a practitioner.[96]
Modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The Assassin's Creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game).[97][98][99] The Mirror's Edge games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles.[100][101] Brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter.[102] Prince of Persia and Dying Light include a central parkour mechanic,[103][104] while Crackdown and Crackdown 2 include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects.[105] Tony Hawk's American Wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard.[106] Tron Evolution's basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.[107]
Military training[edit]
Although parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training,[4][26] it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film Casino Royale, military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Army Corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to Corps soldiers.[108] Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military[109] and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in parkour.[110]
Derivative terminologies and disciplines[edit]
In September 2003, the documentary Jump London, starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term "freerunning" was used as an attempt to translate "parkour", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience.[111] Foucan decided to keep using the term "freerunning" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.[112][113]
The remaining seven Yamakasi members continued to use the term "l'art du déplacement", also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, l'art du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term "parkour", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.[113]
Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression.[112] Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.[114]

Parkour (French pronunciation: ​[paʁkuʁ]) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.[4][5][6] Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement, and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.[7][8] Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.
Parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces.[9][10] Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.[11][12]
Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s.[13][14] The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.[4]

Etymology[edit]
The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant, the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by Georges Hébert.[15][16][17] Raymond Belle used the term "le parcours" to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement.[18] His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming "parkour".[19]
A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse.[7] They are nouns derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in reference to drawing.[20] The verb tracer used familiarly means: "to buck up".[21] The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.[22]
A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.
History[edit]
Georges Hébert[edit]
In Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was French naval officer Georges Hébert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa.[23] He noted, "their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature."[23] His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Saint-Pierre, Martinique, reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism.[23] Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. Hébert set up a "méthode naturelle" (natural method) session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence, swimming. These were intended to develop "the three main forces": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath).[24] During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a "parcours du combattant"[25]—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses.[23]
Raymond and David Belle[edit]
Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.[4][26][27]




David Belle is considered the founder of parkour.


Raymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings[which?] that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.[4][18]
Through conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called "parcours". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.[18]
Yamakasi[edit]
Main article: Yamakasi
David initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.[1] The group eventually included David Belle, Sébastien Foucan, Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière.
Discipline[edit]
The group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.[28] For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.[29] During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.[30] At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.[31]
Respecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.[29]
Humility was an important principle.[31] No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.[29]
To join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.[30] Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently — "to create the means to be yourself"[32] — and there was a complete trust within the group.[31] Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.[33] If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.[34]
Name and split[edit]
In 1997, David Belle's brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris.[35] For the performance, the group named themselves Yamakasi—Congolese Lingala ya makási, meaning strong in one's person, or "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: "l'art du déplacement" (French for "the art of movement").[35] The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name "parkour" to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term l'art du déplacement [4][36] (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).
Organisations[edit]
National parkour organisations include Apex School of Movement (United States), Fédération de Parkour (France), Jump freerun (Netherlands), Parkour UK, Parkour and Tricking Sweden, Australian Parkour Association and New Zealand Parkour Association.
International parkout organisations include the Mouvement International du Parkour, Freerunning et l'Art du Déplacement, the Fédération Internationale des Arts Du Déplacement, and the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it "to be alive" and "for people to use it".[37] Châu Belle explains it is a "type of freedom" or "kind of expression"; that parkour is "only a state of mind" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers.[37] Traceur Dylan Baker says, "Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles".[37][38][39] A study by Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.[40]
Academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.[41]
A newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of "human reclamation".[42] Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as "a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it."[42] Another traceur[who?] writes, "It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour."[43]
Competition[edit]
A campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry.[44][45] In the words of Erwan Le Corre: "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore."[44] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'"[46] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.[citation needed]
David Belle[edit]
In his 2009 book "Parkour", David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better."[47] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else."[48]
The philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts.[49] In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?".[25] In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before."[50] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one."[51]
Belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, "Precision is all about being measured," and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.[52] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times."[48] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.
Practice[edit]
Movement[edit]

While there is no official list of "moves" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others,[8] and there are a number of movements considered fundamental.[5] Some examples of common movements are:[53][54]

Vaulting over obstacles.
Jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles.
Jumping and landing feet-first on a vertical surface, catching the horizontal top with the hands.[55]
Using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops.
Running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall.
Moving from a position hanging from a wall-top or ledge, to standing on the top or over to the other side.

Equipment[edit]

Parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing.[56][57] Traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback.[58][59] Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps.[60] Barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, "bare feet are the best shoes."[61] Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour.[62]
Risks[edit]
Trespassing[edit]

Parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom.[63] Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property,[64] and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries.[65] Many parkour organizations around the globe support the Leave No Trace initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit Parkour Visions in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.[66][67][68][69][70]
Injuries and deaths[edit]
Concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings.[71] They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops.[64][72][73] Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.[72][74][75][76]
Because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task."[77] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.[78]
American traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare "because participants rely not on what they can't control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet," but Lanier Johnson, executive director of the American Sports Medicine Institute, noted that many of the injuries are not reported.[79]
Impact[edit]
Initially featured in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One station trailer Rush Hour. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme,[80] and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used.[81] This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.[5][82]
The creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is very common in the parkour community.[4][36] Jump London is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their parkour skills. Jump London changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs.[41] It was followed by Jump Britain in 2005. The Australian version of 60 Minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.[83]
Parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, which has been particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation.[84] For example, in 2010 The New York Times published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community.[85] In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.[86]
Entertainment[edit]
Parkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers. The first director to do so was Luc Besson, for the film Taxi 2 in 1998, followed by Yamakasi in 2001 featuring members of the original Yamakasi group, and its sequel Les fils du vent in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote District 13, another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli,[87][88] followed by the sequel District 13: Ultimatum in 2009 and remade in English as Brick Mansions in 2014. In 2006 the film Casino Royale featured Sébastien Foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie, sparking renewed media interest in parkour.[25] Along with The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Casino Royale is credited with starting a new wave of Parkour-inspired stunts in Western film and television.[89] Parkour was prominent in Live Free or Die Hard (2007),[90] again with stuntman/actor Cyril Raffaelli, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), choreographed by David Belle.[91] Several films besides Yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour, such as Breaking and Entering (2006),[87][88] Run (2013),[92] and Tracers (2015). The 2011 film Freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival. Parkour also featured in Dhoom 3 (2013).[93]
MTV's show Ultimate Parkour Challenge premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.[94]
Actor Stephen Amell learned parkour at Tempest Academy in preparation for his role as Oliver Queen in the television series Arrow.[95] One of his co-stars on Arrow, Caity Lotz, is also a practitioner.[96]
Modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The Assassin's Creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game).[97][98][99] The Mirror's Edge games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles.[100][101] Brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter.[102] Prince of Persia and Dying Light include a central parkour mechanic,[103][104] while Crackdown and Crackdown 2 include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects.[105] Tony Hawk's American Wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard.[106] Tron Evolution's basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.[107]
Military training[edit]
Although parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training,[4][26] it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film Casino Royale, military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Army Corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to Corps soldiers.[108] Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military[109] and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in parkour.[110]
Derivative terminologies and disciplines[edit]
In September 2003, the documentary Jump London, starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term "freerunning" was used as an attempt to translate "parkour", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience.[111] Foucan decided to keep using the term "freerunning" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.[112][113]
The remaining seven Yamakasi members continued to use the term "l'art du déplacement", also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, l'art du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term "parkour", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.[113]
Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression.[112] Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.[114]
