Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

Investors Should Avoid Parnell Pharmaceuticals IPO - PARNELL PHARMS HLDGS LTD (OTCMKTS:PARNF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Investors Should Avoid Parnell Pharmaceuticals IPOJun.17.14 | About: PARNELL PHARMS (PARNF) Don Dion Long/short equity, special situations, momentum, event-drivenMarketplaceIPO InsightsSummaryAustralia-based PARN is a pharmaceutical firm, seeking to develop, manufacture and commercialize animal health products.Although PARN has products marketed in fourteen countries, the firm is losing money and faces strong competition from larger firms.We recommend investors avoid this IPO.Parnell Pharmaceuticals Holdings Ltd (PARN), a pharmaceutical firm that seeks to develop, manufacture and commercialize animal health products, plans to raise $64.8 million in its upcoming IPO.
The Alexandria, Australia-based firm will offer 3.6 million shares, including 10% insider shares, at an expected price range of $17-$19 per share. If the IPO can hit the midpoint of that range at $18 per share, PARN will command a market value of $207 million.
Filing Date, Underwriters
PARN filed on May 19, 2014.
Lead Underwriters: Jefferies LLC; Piper Jaffray & Co.
Underwriters: Geller Biopharm; JMP Securities LLC; Ladenburg Thalmann and Co. Inc
PARN Products Used in 14 Countries
PARN is pharmaceutical firm engaged in the development, manufacturing and commercialization of animal health products.
The firm's five current products are marketed in fourteen countries. PARN's pair of proprietary software platforms are also designed to enhance animals' performance and quality of life, while improving efficiency and profitability for PARN's customers.
The firm continues to focus on developing new products, having conducted over 31 clinical trials over the course of the past ten years with plans to conduct at least 25 more trials over the next four years. PARN plans to bring at least seven new products to market in the next five years.
PARN's current products include health solutions for both production animals and companion animals. The firm's estroPLAN and GONAbreed hormone products are intended to improve cattle breeding performance, while Zydax treats osteoarthritis in dogs and horses.
Valuation
PARN offers the following figures in its F-1 balance sheet for the nine months ended March 31, 2014:

Revenues: $4,044,000.00
Total Comprehensive Loss: ($6,584,000.00)
Total Assets: $33,753,000.00
Total Equity: ($2,159,000.00)


Competition From Numerous Large Animal Health Firms
PARN competes with numerous large animal health firms, some of which may have access to greater financial and technical resources than PARN.
Some of these competitors offer directly competing product lines, while others may perform research to create competing products.
Major competitors include Zoetis, Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), Merck & Co., Inc (NYSE:MRK), Sanofi S.A. (NYSE:SNY), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Bayer AG (OTCPK:BAYRY), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), Ceva Animal Health (NASDAQ:CEVA), and Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health.
Management Highlights
President and CEO Robert Joseph has served in his current positions and as a Director since 2006.
Mr. Joseph previously served as Senior Brand Manager-Diabetes and a Company Marketing Strategy Manager with Eli Lilly. He also worked as a Financial Planning Manager with Allergan, Inc. and as a Business Performance Manager with Herron Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd.
Mr. Joseph holds degrees in science (pre-medicine), finance (accounting and commercial law) and marketing from the University of Queensland in Australia, and is a Certified Public Accountant in Australia.
Conclusion: Investors Should Avoid PARN
We plan to avoid this IPO. We hear the underwriters may need to lower the price to get this puppy launched.
Though PARN already has numerous products already available in multiple markets, the firm is losing money, and there's little evidence that further product development will reverse the company's fortunes.
In any case, the firm's plans to release further products are far from guaranteed, as PARN will have to satisfy the regulatory bodies of various countries in order to bring their products to market.
PARN's IPO underwriting is less than impressive, and competition is fierce.
We see little reason to bet on this firm.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
