Thank you for your feedback.
If you need help or have a question for Customer Service, please visit the Help Section.Safety & SecurityThere is nothing as important as home and office safety and security. And while it might seem easy to have your safety bases covered, you don’t want to miss any important aspects. Amazon.com's Safety & Security Store offers an array of products designed to ensure that no important part of your life goes unprotected. 

To start with perhaps the most dramatic safety issue, be sure you have a full set of fire safety products. These include smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors (watch for combination smoke and CO alarms as well, which can be especially handy) in conjunction with trustworthy fire extinguishers and fire escape ladders. Other alarms that should be in place to protect your family and home are flood alarms and freeze alarms, and to keep unwanted intruders away look for home security systems, home monitoring cameras, and security mailboxes.

If you're a contractor, woodworker, or even someone who occasionally picks up a drill around the house, don’t forget about the safety equipment and gear that should be in place before you even plug in a power tool. Back belts, ear protection, eye protection, fall-arrest kits, hardhats, masks, safety vests, safety cones and tape, work gloves, and flashlights, rechargeable flashlights, headlamps, and key chain flashlights are also vital elements of a personal safety ensemble. For making sure your personal possessions, as well as your person, are safe, we have a great selection of cabinet safes, fire-resistant safes, gun safes, diversion safes, and wall safes as well as combination locks, bike locks, keyed padlocks, and luggage locks. 

Since safety and security products are so crucial, be sure to pick out products from a reliable brand, names like 3M, AO Safety, Custom Leather Craft, First Alert, Kidde, Master Lock, Mechanix Wear, Peltor, SentrySafe, Skylink, and Youngstown. You'll also find a wide range of deals and special offers on building materials and supplies in the Value Center. Being prepared with the right products is the best way to guarantee security and safety.
