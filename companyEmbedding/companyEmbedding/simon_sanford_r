               Company: Rockefeller University
Job Details
               Founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1901, The Rockefeller University was this nation's first biomedical research institution. Hallmarks of the university include a research environment that provides scientists with the support they need to do imaginative science and a truly international graduate program that is unmatched for the freedom and resources it provides students to develop their capacities for innovative research. The Rockefeller University Hospital, founded in 1910 as the first center for clinical research in the United States, remains a place where researchers combine laboratory investigations with bedside observations to provide a scientific basis for disease detection, prevention, and treatment. Since the institution's founding, Rockefeller University has been the site of many important scientific breakthroughs. Rockefeller scientists, for example, established that DNA is the chemical basis of heredity, identified the weight-regulating hormone leptin, discovered blood groups, showed that viruses can cause cancer, founded the modern field of cell biology, worked out the structure of antibodies, devised the AIDS "cocktail" drug therapy, and developed methadone maintenance for people addicted to heroin. Throughout Rockefeller's history, 24 scientists associated with the university have received the Nobel Prize in physiology/medicine and chemistry, and 21 scientists associated with the university have been honored with the Albert Lasker Medical Research Award. Eighteen Rockefeller University scientists have received the Canada Gairdner Award, and 20 have garnered the National Medal of Science. Currently, the university's award-winning faculty includes five Nobel laureates, seven Lasker Award winners, 10 Canada Gairdner Award honorees, and three recipients of the National Medal of Science. Thirty-three of the faculty members are elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, and 17 are members of the Institute of Medicine.

Research Description

 
 




Acute and chronic inflammatory responses are important host defenses against foreign substances or pathogens. These responses are largely mediated by neutrophils and macrophages, which release proteases, cytokines, and a number of other mediators of inflammation in the course of defending the host. We study the mechanisms of action of serine proteases and metalloproteases from activated neutrophils and develop specific inhibitors to control the tissue destruction which may otherwise injure the host during an inflammatory response. Because invasiveness and metastatic spread of tumor cells involves tissue degradation by the same families of proteinases as is seen in inflammation, we have extended our studies to include evaluation of agents intended to block tumor spread or tumor-stimulated vessel growth (angiogenesis).  Our methods include biophysical probes of enzyme active sites and kinetic measurements. We also measure neutrophil and macrophage phagocytic activity and release of oxidants by flow cytometry. We have made extensive use of a complete interstitial extracellular matrix from rat smooth muscle cells which we label biosynthetically and employ as a substrate for inflammatory cells and tumor cells and their proteases. We employ matrices on porous membrane filters to quantitate inhibition of invasive migration of neutrophils, macrophages, endothelial cells, and tumor cells by proteinase inhibitors and other modulatory agents. Our collaboration with colleagues in the Department of Oral Biology and Pathology has led to a series of clinical trials on a class of proteinase inhibitors with additional pleiotropic downregulatory actions on inflammatory and tumor cells. The trials of these inhibitors, which are nonantimicrobial derivatives of tetracyclines, target potential applications in management of cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, periodontal disease, and cardiovascular complications of smoking.  To understand how inflammatory cells communicate we study paracrine mechanisms of activation by cytokines, using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry to measure levels of expression of cell surface receptors and other marker proteins which are sensitive to the state of activation of the cells.

 Educational Background



Ph.D. in Biochemistry 
Class of 1967 


The Rockefeller University

                  The Rockefeller University is a world-renowned center for research and graduate education in the biomedical sciences, chemistry, bioinformatics and physics. The university’s 72 laboratories conduct both clinical and basic research and study a diverse range of biological and biomedical problems with the mission of improving the understanding of life for the benefit of humanity.

Founded in 1901 by John D. Rockefeller, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was the country’s first institution devoted exclusively to biomedical research. The Rockefeller University Hospital was founded in 1910 as the first hospital devoted exclusively to clinical research. In the 1950s, the institute expanded its mission to include graduate education and began training new generations of scientists to become research leaders around the world. In 1965, it was renamed The Rockefeller University.

The university is supported by a combination of government and private grants and contracts, private philanthropy and income from the endowment.

Since its founding, The Rockefeller University has embraced an open structure to encourage collaboration between disciplines and empower faculty members to take on high-risk, high-reward projects. No formal departments exist, bureaucracy is kept to a minimum and scientists are given resources, support and unparalleled freedom to follow the science wherever it leads.

This unique approach to science has led to some of the world’s most revolutionary contributions to biology and medicine.

Throughout Rockefeller’s history, 24 of its scientists have won Nobel Prizes, 21 have won Lasker Awards and 20 have garnered the National Medal of Science, the highest science award given by the United States.

For more than 100 years, The Rockefeller Hospital has served as an essential link between laboratory investigation and bedside observation, as patients are participants in clinical studies building on basic research findings from Rockefeller laboratories. This continuous spectrum of research allows for in-depth study of the basis of disease detection, prevention and observation.

The David Rockefeller Graduate Program is based on the concept of learning science by doing science, and is custom tailored to its individual students and attracts a diverse group of exceptional scientists from around the world. The university also offers one of the nation’s top M.D.-Ph.D. programs with neighboring Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Cornell Medical College.

In addition to the graduate program, there are other learning/training opportunities available, including postdoctoral research, fellowships for the Center for Studies in Physics and Biology and the Clinical Scholars Program, a master's degree for recent M.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. recipients to begin careers in patient-oriented research                




B.A. in Zoology & Chemistry 
Class of 1963 


Columbia University

                  Columbia University is one of the world's most important centers of research and at the same time a distinctive and distinguished learning environment for undergraduates and graduate students in many scholarly and professional fields. The University recognizes the importance of its location in New York City and seeks to link its research and teaching to the vast resources of a great metropolis. It seeks to attract a diverse and international faculty and student body, to support research and teaching on global issues, and to create academic relationships with many countries and regions. It expects all areas of the university to advance knowledge and learning at the highest level and to convey the products of its efforts to the world.
