	Item 4.



	Purpose of Transaction.





	The Reporting Persons acquired the Shares in connection with
	the Transaction for investment purposes only. The Reporting Persons believe that the Issuer is an attractive investment opportunity. Depending upon overall market conditions, other investment opportunities available to the Reporting Persons,
	and the availability of Shares at prices that would make the purchase or sale of Shares desirable, the Reporting Persons may endeavor to increase or decrease their respective positions in the Issuer through, among other things, the purchase or sale
	of Shares on the open market or in private transactions or otherwise, on such terms and at such times as the Reporting Persons may deem advisable.


	No Reporting Person nor, to the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, without independent verification, any other persons named in
	Item 2 hereof, has any present plan or proposal which would relate to or result in any of the matters set forth in subparagraphs (a) - (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D except as set forth herein or such as would occur upon completion of
	any of the actions discussed herein. The Reporting Persons intend to review their respective investments in the Issuer on a continuing basis. Depending on various factors including, without limitation, the Issuers financial position and
	investment strategy, the price levels of the Shares, conditions in the securities markets and general economic and industry conditions, the Reporting Persons may in the future take such actions with respect to their respective investments in the
	Issuer as they deem appropriate including, without limitation, communicating with stockholders, management and the Board of Directors of the Issuer, engaging in discussions with third parties about the Issuer and the Reporting Persons
	investment, making proposals to the Issuer concerning changes to the capitalization, ownership structure, board structure (including seeking board representation), or operations of the Issuer, purchasing additional Shares, selling some or all of
	their Shares, engaging in short selling of or any hedging or similar transaction with respect to the Shares, or changing their intention with respect to any and all matters referred to in Item 4.
