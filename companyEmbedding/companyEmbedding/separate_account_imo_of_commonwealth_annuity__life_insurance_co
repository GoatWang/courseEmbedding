The Sub-Accounts that will no longer be available for new payment allocations or
transfers are collectively referred to as the "Closed Sub-Accounts." If you     
currently have Accumulated Value allocated to a Closed Sub-Account as of the    
Close Date, you may remain invested in that Closed Sub-Account until you        
transfer to other investment options. However, if you transfer out of a Closed  
Sub-Account after the Close Date, you will not be able to transfer back into any
of the Closed Sub-Accounts. The closing of the Closed Sub-Accounts to new       
payments and transfers does not affect the other Sub-Account investment options 
that are currently available under your Policy.

If you currently have in effect a Dollar Cost Averaging ("DCA") program, or an  
Automatic Account Rebalancing ("AAR") program that is directed to any of the    
Affected Sub-Accounts, it will terminate as of the Close Date. However, you may 
establish a new program using the other Sub-Accounts that are available under   
your policy. If you currently have a Monthly Automatic Payment ("MAP") program, 
or a Future Payment Allocation ("FPA") that is directed to any of the Affected  
Sub-Accounts, you will be required to change your allocation. AFTER THE CLOSE   
DATE, THE COMPANY WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY PAYMENTS THAT INCLUDE ALLOCATIONS TO THE  
AFFECTED SUB-ACCOUNTS.                                                          

For policy holders whose automated payment features (AAR, DCA, MAP and FPA) are 
impacted by the above Sub-Account closings, a subsequent mailing will be        
forwarded to you with instruction and a form to make the necessary changes to   
your allocations.

Applicants' Representations
1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (“THG”), formerly Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman Sachs”). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Start Printed Page 20666Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% of the outstanding ordinary shares.
3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of “separate account,” as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective registration statements.
5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios (“Substitutions”):

7. The Replacement Portfolios are all series of the Trust. The Trust is an insurance-dedicated Delaware statutory trust that was organized on June 17, 2013. The Trust is registered with the Commission as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-22865) and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act (File No. 333-189870). The Trust is a series investment company and currently has 30 separate portfolios (each, a “Global Atlantic Fund,” and collectively, the “Global Atlantic Funds”). The following 13 Global Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value Insights Portfolio.
8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global Atlantic.
9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock Investment Management, LLC (“BlackRock”) or Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New York, NY 20182.
10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can be found in the application.
12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in greater detail.
13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully invested at all times.
14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.[2] 

15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the “Substitution Date”), and for those Contracts with assets allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Start Printed Page 20669Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.
17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution Date (the “Pre-Substitution Notice”). Pre-Substitution Notices sent to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a “Confirmation”) informing them that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 1940 Act.
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other “market timing” activity) that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17 Start Printed Page 20670Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons.
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.
7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.
9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants' Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from the Commission.
3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.
5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way.
7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available investment option under the Contract without charge for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as set forth in Condition 7 Start Printed Page 20671above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.

2.
     The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

Applicants' Representations

    1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business 
of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance 
policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of 
Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of 
Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
    2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica 
Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (``THG''), formerly 
Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the 
closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 
(``Goldman Sachs''). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed 
its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and

[[Page 20666]]

Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. 
Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the 
common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is 
a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group 
Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired 
ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services 
LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., 
which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) 
Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of 
approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and 
other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% 
of the outstanding ordinary shares.
    3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of ``separate 
account,'' as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-
1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the 
Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of 
the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the 
Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the 
legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate 
Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in 
an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a 
series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts 
corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and 
affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are 
conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
    4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act''), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as 
applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and 
investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective 
registration statements.
    5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity 
contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the 
prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to 
substitute shares of another registered investment company for the 
shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be 
purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
    6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of 
the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios 
(``Substitutions''):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. The Replacement Portfolios are all series of the Trust. The 
Trust is an insurance-dedicated Delaware statutory trust that was 
organized on June 17, 2013. The Trust is registered with the Commission 
as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File 
No. 811-22865) and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act (File 
No. 333-189870). The Trust is a series investment company and currently 
has 30 separate portfolios (each, a ``Global Atlantic Fund,'' and 
collectively, the ``Global Atlantic Funds''). The following 13 Global 
Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined 
Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, 
Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core 
Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, 
Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman 
Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global 
Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap 
Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap 
Value Insights Portfolio.
    8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a 
registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of 
the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement 
between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global 
Atlantic.
    9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock 
Investment Management, LLC (``BlackRock'') or Goldman Sachs Asset 
Management, L.P. (``GSAM''). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a 
commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, 
Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets 
under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 
University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman 
Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory 
affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 
trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New 
York, NY 20182.
    10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have 
investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle 
risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially 
similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those 
Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
    11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement 
Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment 
strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can 
be found in the application.
    12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, 
Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and 
maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer 
a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed 
Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract 
owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing 
Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses 
immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed 
Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the 
combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement 
Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding 
Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of 
each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in 
greater detail.
    13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined 
below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing 
Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders 
will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully 
invested at all times.
    14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset 
values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in 
conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected 
Contract owners.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the 
Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees 
and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the 
Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the 
Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the 
Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect 
the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by 
the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the 
relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and 
Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot 
predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the 
time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable 
variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return 
characteristics.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result 
of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 
Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the 
Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. 
Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and 
transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting 
expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and 
expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract 
owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not 
cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract 
owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the 
proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way 
alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with 
their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as 
a result of the Substitutions.
    16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years 
following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the 
``Substitution Date''), and for those Contracts with assets allocated 
to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an 
affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last 
business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose 
subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the 
extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses 
(taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such 
period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating 
expenses of the

[[Page 20669]]

Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date 
of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase 
the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under 
the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following 
the Substitution Date.
    17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) 
through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may 
make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount 
investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the 
Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available 
subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any 
transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract 
values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be 
transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge 
and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, 
Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts 
to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the 
Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for 
a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date 
through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
    18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract 
owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 
Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the 
applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution 
Date (the ``Pre-Substitution Notice''). Pre-Substitution Notices sent 
to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 
497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise 
Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice 
through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may 
make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts 
investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the 
Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available 
subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer 
limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected 
Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive 
transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, 
Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts 
to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the 
Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, 
through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all 
affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable 
Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
    19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract 
owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract 
owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of 
the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a 
``Confirmation'') informing them that the Substitutions were carried 
out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the 
information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation 
will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the 
Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement 
Portfolio after the Substitution.

Legal Analysis

    1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an 
order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed 
Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or 
trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the 
securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of 
another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) 
provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the 
Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is 
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 
1940 Act.
    2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the 
standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the 
Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress 
intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this 
provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the 
Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing 
Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially 
similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing 
Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net 
annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their 
corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
    3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to 
substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current 
funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The 
Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
    4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the 
proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the 
investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while 
reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide 
array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the 
proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or 
quality of the available investment options and the proposed 
Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to 
its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 
26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed 
Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure 
documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available 
investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also 
assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 
26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly 
forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. 
In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any 
features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or 
riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner 
will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of 
any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will 
offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the 
affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than 
those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect 
and deter disruptive transfer and other ``market timing'' activity) 
that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date 
of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to 
the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution 
Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the 
Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type 
of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the 
Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
    5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) 
exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent 
necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all 
of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17

[[Page 20670]]

Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be 
effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and 
purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or 
more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated 
persons.
    6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits 
any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any 
affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly 
selling any security or other property to that company. Section 
17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described 
above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or 
other property from the registered investment company.
    7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions 
may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing 
Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the 
Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios 
with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. 
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent 
Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the 
Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one 
another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is 
conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be 
viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 
17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
    8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed 
in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the 
Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, 
as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not 
involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 
17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind 
transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing 
Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are 
reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because 
the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions 
enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions 
will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the 
requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected 
Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax 
treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their 
Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a 
result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts 
will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the 
Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-
7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline 
the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and 
reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude 
overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated 
persons.
    9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind 
purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of 
the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's 
registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, 
the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are 
consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.

Applicants' Conditions

    The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree 
that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the 
following conditions:
    1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth 
determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of 
registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by 
the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described 
in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any 
regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are 
qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to 
complete the Substitutions.
    2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a 
sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of 
Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement 
order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio 
without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-
adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to 
rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from 
the Commission.
    3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will 
pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including 
legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and 
other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the 
affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed 
Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently 
being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed 
Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
    4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset 
values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in 
conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected 
Contract owners.
    5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of 
affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax 
liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the 
Substitutions.
    6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of 
the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract 
owners will not be altered in any way.
    7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one 
transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the 
Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement 
Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available 
investment option under the Contract without charge for a period 
beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at 
least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in 
any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant 
prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights 
reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers 
between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on 
the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days 
before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the 
Substitution Date.
    8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days 
before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of 
Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended 
Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as 
set forth in Condition 7

above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to 
affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution 
Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
    9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract 
owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written 
confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the 
Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a 
restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution 
Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the 
Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement 
Portfolio after the Substitution.
    10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for 
Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, 
Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will 
reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the 
Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement 
Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual 
operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense 
reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the 
net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most 
recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, 
the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and 
charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the 
Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution 
Date.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
