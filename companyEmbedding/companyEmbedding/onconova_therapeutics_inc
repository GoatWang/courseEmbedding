Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Positive Phase 2 Data in Rigosertib Treated Patients with Second-Line Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Jun 5 17
Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. announced the results of a Phase 2 study with rigosertib as a treatment for higher risk (HR-MDS) after failure of hypomethylating agents (HMAs). The study sought to evaluate bone marrow blast (BMBL) response to rigosertib as a surrogate for overall survival (OS) in this patient population. The results showed treatment with rigosertib resulted in a reduction in BMBL count, including complete bone marrow responses, confirming findings in earlier studies. Thus, BMBL response to rigosertib is a potential surrogate marker for improvement in overall survival in this patient population. Summary of Data from the 04-24 Trial: Patient Demographics: 64 patients treated, with a median age of 73, median prior HMA duration of 10.8 months; Eligible patients had 5%-30% BMBL confirmed within six weeks pre-study and disease. progression as per International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria, Cheson et al., Blood 2006) on or after HMAs within two years; Safety/Tolerability: Intravenous rigosertib has been well tolerated to date; More than 1,100 patients have been treated with rigosertib; Adverse events in study 04-24 were similar to those observed in the preceding Phase 3 ONTIME Study; Objectives: Primary Efficacy: Evaluate the relationship between BMBL response and OS in MDS patients with excess blasts (5-30%) progressing on or after treatment with azacitidine or decitabine who are administered 72-hr continuous intravenous (IV) infusions of 1800 mg/24 hour rigosertib every 2 weeks for 8 cycles and every 4 weeks thereafter.  BMBL response is defined according to the International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria; or stable BM response (no progression). Secondary Efficacy: Evaluate the following parameters: Overall response (CR, partial response/remission [PR], BMCR, and stable disease [SD]) according to 2006 IWG criteria; Population pharmacokinetics. Safety: safety and tolerability of rigosertib administered as 72-hour continuous IV (5%-30% BMBL) progressing on or after treatment with azacitidine or decitabine. Trial Design: Phase 2 open-label, multi-center multi-national study (approximately 30-40 Centers in the US and Europe) of the efficacy and safety of Rigosertib administered as 72-hour continuous intravenous infusions in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with excess blasts progressing on or after treatment with azacitidine or decitabine. Treatment will continue until IWG 2006 progression criteria are met (that is, 50% increase of BMBL or worsening of cytopenias) or until death from any cause, whichever comes first.

UPDATE: Onconova Therapeutics stock surges 7% on positive mid-stage clinical trial results
Onconova Therapeutics Inc.  stock surged 7% in morning trade Monday after the company said its drug had positive results in a mid-stage clinical trial for patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, conditions that are considered a type of cancer. Patients in the trial weren't successfully treated with the standard of care, hypomethylating agents. Only about 40% to 50% of patients usually respond to that treatment, according to a 2015 scientific paper, and "outcome after HMA treatment failure is poor and represents an unmet need." Onconova Therapeutics' rigosertib's effect on bone marrow blast was tested as a proxy for overall survival, the company said, with patients demonstrating a reduction in the measure after treatment. These results from the trial, which treated 64 patients, are thus "a potential surrogate marker for improvement in overall survival in this patient population," the company said. The drug is currently being tested in a late-stage clinical trial. Onconova Therapeutics shares have dropped 22.3% to $1.99 over the last three months, compared with a 2.2% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Onconova Therapeutics stock surges 7% on positive mid-stage clinical trial results
Onconova Therapeutics Inc.  stock surged 7% in morning trade Monday after the company said its drug had positive results in a mid-stage clinical trial for patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, conditions that are considered a type of cancer. Patients in the trial weren't successfully treated with the standard of care, hypomethylating agents. Only about 40% to 50% of patients usually respond to that treatment, according to a 2015 scientific paper, and "outcome after HMA treatment failure is poor and represents an unmet need." Onconova Therapeutics' rigosertib's effect on bone marrow blast was tested as a proxy for overall survival, the company said, with patients demonstrating a reduction in the measure after treatment. These results from the trial, which treated 64 patients, are thus "a potential surrogate marker for improvement in overall survival in this patient population," the company said. The drug is currently being tested in a late-stage clinical trial. Onconova Therapeutics shares have dropped 22.3% to $1.99 over the last three months, compared with a 2.2% rise in the S&P 500 .
