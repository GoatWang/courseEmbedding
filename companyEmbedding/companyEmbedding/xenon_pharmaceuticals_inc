	NEWS RELEASE


	 


	Xenon Pharmaceuticals Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update


	 


	BURNABY, British Columbia, May

	9

	, 2017 -- Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq:XENE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company today, reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and provided a corporate update for 2017.


	 


	Dr. Simon Pimstone, Xenon's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to leverage our expertise in human genetics and ion channel targets to advance our neurology-focused product candidates and identify potential new therapeutic assets. In addition to our two partnered programs in pain and our proprietary XEN901 epilepsy program, we recently expanded our ion channel, neurology-focused pipeline to include XEN1101, a Kv7 potassium channel opener for the treatment of epilepsy.”


	 


	Dr. Pimstone added, “We are positioned to see a number of key events in the coming months including topline data expected mid-year from the Phase 2b clinical trial of TV-45070 in post-herpetic neuralgia being conducted by our collaborator, Teva. We anticipate Genentech will advance GDC-0310 into a Phase 2 clinical trial this year. Within our proprietary programs, we anticipate that XEN1101 will be in a Phase 1 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, we look forward to filing an IND, or IND equivalent application, for XEN901 in the fourth quarter of this year.”


	 


	Achievements and Anticipated Milestones


	 


	Proprietary Pipeline


	 






	 





	•






	XEN1101 is a next-generation Kv7 potassium channel opener for the treatment of epilepsy. Pre-clinically, XEN1101 has demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics, selectivity, potency and efficacy over first-generation potassium channel modulators, such as ezogabine. Xenon anticipates filing an investigational new drug (IND), or IND equivalent, application to initiate a Phase 1 first-in-man clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2017.







	 






	 





	•






	XEN901 is a potent, selective Nav1.6 sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of rare infantile epileptic encephalopathies and other forms of epilepsy. XEN901 has demonstrated efficacy against seizures in an animal model of Nav1.6 gain-of-function SCN8A epilepsy as well as models that support the treatment of adult partial onset epilepsy. Xenon expects to file an IND, or IND equivalent, application in the fourth quarter of 2017.







	 


	Partnered Programs


	 






	 





	•






	TV-45070 is a topical sodium channel inhibitor being developed in collaboration with Xenon’s partner, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Teva is currently conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of TV-45070 in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia. Enrollment is complete with topline results expected in mid-2017.











	 





	•






	Xenon's collaborator Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for GDC-0310, which is an oral, selective Nav1.7 small-molecule inhibitor. Pending a full assessment of the Phase 1 clinical results and ongoing


	in vivo


	studies, Genentech anticipates initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2017 for the potential treatment of pain.







	 





	 




	 





	First Quarter 2017 Financial Results



	 


	Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2017 were $58.0 million, compared to $64.1 million as of December 31, 2016. There were 17,996,680 common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2017.


	 


	For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, Xenon reported total revenue of $0.02 million, compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $0.6 million was primarily attributable to revenue recognized related to the upfront payment from the March 2014 genetics collaborative agreement with Genentech which was fully recognized by March 2016. The remaining decrease was due to less full time equivalent funding from collaborative partners as resources were shifted from supporting collaborations to Xenon’s proprietary programs.


	 


	Research and development expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $5.9 million, compared to $4.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increase of $1.5 million was primarily attributable to increased spending on XEN801 and XEN901 product candidates as well as internal preclinical and discovery programs, partially offset by a decrease in collaboration expenses.


	 


	General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $2.1 million, compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2016. The increase of $0.2 million was primarily attributable to increased costs for business development and salaries and benefits, partially offset by the fair value adjustment on liability classified stock options.


	 


	Other income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $0.5 million, compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $1.9 million was primarily driven by a decrease in unrealized foreign exchange gains arising from the translation of Canadian denominated balances to U.S. dollars.


	 


	Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $7.5 million, compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2016. The change was primarily attributable to lower revenue, higher research and development and general and administrative expenses and lower unrealized foreign exchange gains.


	 


	Conference Call Information

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc. Announce Phase II Study of Topical TV-45070 in Patients with Post-Herpetic Neuralgia
Jun 27 17
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced top-line results in a Phase II study of topical TV-45070 in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). TV-45070 did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change in pain from baseline to week four as assessed by the numeric rating scale (NRS). Secondary endpoints were also not met. There were no safety concerns in the study. The companies plan to further analyze the data from this study to determine the next steps for TV-45070, and may look to present study data at a relevant forthcoming scientific conference. TV-45070 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the sodium channel Nav1.7, and other sodium channels, expressed in the pain-sensing peripheral nervous system. TV-45070 was licensed by Xenon to Teva in December 2012. This Phase II trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TV-45070 in patients with PHN. The study included three treatment groups that received topical ointment containing 4% or 8% TV-45070 or placebo, dosed twice daily. The primary endpoint of this study was the change of average daily pain scores from baseline to week four, measured using an 11-point (0-10) numeric rating scale (NRS). Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients with greater than 30% and greater than 50% improvement in pain scores, quality of life measurements and adverse events measurements. The study was carried out at 48 centers in the US and involved 300 patients randomized to 100 patients receiving 4% TV-45070, 100 patients receiving 8% TV-45070 and 100 patients receiving placebo.

A company focused on the genetics of rare diseases to develop novel medicines
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing a pipeline of differentiated therapeutics for orphan indications that we intend to commercialize on our own, and for larger market indications that we intend to partner with global pharmaceutical companies. We have built a core enabling discovery platform for the discovery of validated drug targets by studying rare human diseases with extreme traits, including diseases caused by mutations in ion channels, known as channelopathies. We have an integrated platform that includes in-house capabilities for human genetics, small molecule drug discovery, as well as preclinical and clinical development.
Our pharmaceutical partners include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Genentech, and Merck & Co. Our pharmaceutical collaborations have generated in aggregate over $155.0 million in non-equity funding to date with the potential to provide us with over $1.0 billion in future milestone payments, as well as royalties and co-promotion income on product sales.
Our business was founded on our proprietary discovery platform, which we refer to as Extreme Genetics. Extreme Genetics involves the study of families where individuals exhibit inherited severe traits, or phenotypes. By identifying and characterizing single-gene defects responsible for these phenotypes, we gain insights into human disease biology to better select targets for therapeutic intervention. We believe that our Extreme Genetics discovery platform enhances the likelihood of discovering a drug target that has a major effect in humans. From these discoveries, we can gain an improved understanding of how a drug that modulates the target might act when given to a human.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to build a self-sustaining, fully-integrated and profitable company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics, including novel selective ion channel inhibitors, by applying our expertise in the genetics of rare human diseases.
Since our inception, we believe we have operated in a capital-efficient manner to build our capabilities and assets through phased growth, expansion and value creation. Prior to our November 2014 initial public offering and concurrent private placement, our last equity financing was in 2006. From 2006 to November 2014, we funded our operations and expanded our platform, product pipeline and infrastructure through a strategy which combined the deployment of our own resources and the establishment of broadly enabling and well-structured pharmaceutical partnerships with industry leaders.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
