History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1955 by two high school friends, Edward W. Wedbush and Robert Werner, in Los Angeles, California. They each contributed $5,000 to capitalize their new company, Wedbush & Company.[1] The company was named after Wedbush because neither partner wanted a possible business failure named after them and Wedbush lost a coin toss.[2]
Wedbush opened its first office in 1957 located in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles. Three years later, Robert Werner decided to sell his interest in the firm to Ed Wedbush.[3] In 1971, the firm became members of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). In 1972, the firm began offering correspondent clearing services, providing trade execution for other brokerage firms.[4] The firm also added an Investment Banking group in 1975.




Headquarters building at 1000 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles


Wedbush expanded their trading and research capabilities and added several retail brokerage offices.[5] In 2000, the firm launched BrokerInsight, a workstation for order entry, portfolio valuation, and account management and in 2006, the firm became the #1 Liquidity Provider on NASDAQ. In late 2009, the firm changed its name to Wedbush Securities Inc. from Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc.
On June 13, 2011, Wedbush Securities' parent company, Wedbush Inc. announced the acquisition of Lime brokerage, a provider of low-latency, high-throughput trading technologies and high-volume agency brokerage.[6]
Barron's released the research results conducted by Zacks Investment Research for top stock picking firms. Zack's scored Wedbush as the number one stock picking firm for three of their four survey periods. Barron's announced that, "Los Angeles-based Wedbush Securities surfed to top honors by wide margins over the 6, 12 and 36 months ended Dec. 31, 2011." [7]
Corporate divisions[edit]
The firm is organized into three main divisions: Capital Markets, Clearing and Technology, and Private Client Services.
Capital Markets Group[edit]
Wedbush Securities’ Research platform consists of over 25 analysts, coverage of more than 300 stocks, a consumer channel checking team and Wedbush Decision Metrics (primary, survey-based research). The Equity Research team provides insights into emerging investment opportunities within sectors such as consumer products and services, new media and entertainment, clean technology and industrial growth, and life sciences. The Wedbush Securities Equity Sales and Trading Group delivers information flow and investment ideas as well as best execution services to small, mid and large cap clients. The group covers more than 1,100 U.S. and European institutions through their Los Angeles, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas and Minneapolis offices and are market makers in over 700 NASDAQ stocks.[8]
The Investment Banking Group provides clients with financing and advisory services while the Fixed Income Group provides investment solutions and financing assistance to private client, institutional, municipal and corporate clients.
Clearing and Technology Group[edit]
The Clearing and Technology Group provides clearing and prime brokerage services for retail broker dealers, institutional firms, black box trading firms, professional trading firms, hedge funds, investment banks, and municipal bond underwriters for a range of services such as prime brokerage and high-frequency trading.
Private Client Services Group[edit]
The Private Client Services Group provides brokerage, advisory products, and services to private and institutional clients, including wealth management, retirement planning, investment management and financial planning.
Legal disputes[edit]
In 2011 it was ordered to pay a former bond trader $3.5 million in withheld compensation[9] for "morally reprehensible" conduct, and was ordered to pay an investor about $2.9 million after an arbitration panel decided that a customer's account had been "churned" and looted by a former Wedbush broker.[9]
On October 20, 2011 it was revealed that Wedbush securities is taking legal action against liquidnet inc for alleged violation of trade secrets.[10]

History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1955 by two high school friends, Edward W. Wedbush and Robert Werner, in Los Angeles, California. They each contributed $5,000 to capitalize their new company, Wedbush & Company.[1] The company was named after Wedbush because neither partner wanted a possible business failure named after them and Wedbush lost a coin toss.[2]
Wedbush opened its first office in 1957 located in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles. Three years later, Robert Werner decided to sell his interest in the firm to Ed Wedbush.[3] In 1971, the firm became members of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). In 1972, the firm began offering correspondent clearing services, providing trade execution for other brokerage firms.[4] The firm also added an Investment Banking group in 1975.




Headquarters building at 1000 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles


Wedbush expanded their trading and research capabilities and added several retail brokerage offices.[5] In 2000, the firm launched BrokerInsight, a workstation for order entry, portfolio valuation, and account management and in 2006, the firm became the #1 Liquidity Provider on NASDAQ. In late 2009, the firm changed its name to Wedbush Securities Inc. from Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc.
On June 13, 2011, Wedbush Securities' parent company, Wedbush Inc. announced the acquisition of Lime brokerage, a provider of low-latency, high-throughput trading technologies and high-volume agency brokerage.[6]
Barron's released the research results conducted by Zacks Investment Research for top stock picking firms. Zack's scored Wedbush as the number one stock picking firm for three of their four survey periods.

History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1955 by two high school friends, Edward W. Wedbush and Robert Werner, in Los Angeles, California. They each contributed $5,000 to capitalize their new company, Wedbush & Company.[1] The company was named after Wedbush because neither partner wanted a possible business failure named after them and Wedbush lost a coin toss.[2]
Wedbush opened its first office in 1957 located in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles. Three years later, Robert Werner decided to sell his interest in the firm to Ed Wedbush.[3] In 1971, the firm became members of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). In 1972, the firm began offering correspondent clearing services, providing trade execution for other brokerage firms.[4] The firm also added an Investment Banking group in 1975.




Headquarters building at 1000 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles


Wedbush expanded their trading and research capabilities and added several retail brokerage offices.[5] In 2000, the firm launched BrokerInsight, a workstation for order entry, portfolio valuation, and account management and in 2006, the firm became the #1 Liquidity Provider on NASDAQ. In late 2009, the firm changed its name to Wedbush Securities Inc. from Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc.
On June 13, 2011, Wedbush Securities' parent company, Wedbush Inc. announced the acquisition of Lime brokerage, a provider of low-latency, high-throughput trading technologies and high-volume agency brokerage.[6]
Barron's released the research results conducted by Zacks Investment Research for top stock picking firms. Zack's scored Wedbush as the number one stock picking firm for three of their four survey periods. Barron's announced that, "Los Angeles-based Wedbush Securities surfed to top honors by wide margins over the 6, 12 and 36 months ended Dec. 31, 2011." [7]
Corporate divisions[edit]
The firm is organized into three main divisions: Capital Markets, Clearing and Technology, and Private Client Services.
Capital Markets Group[edit]
Wedbush Securities’ Research platform consists of over 25 analysts, coverage of more than 300 stocks, a consumer channel checking team and Wedbush Decision Metrics (primary, survey-based research). The Equity Research team provides insights into emerging investment opportunities within sectors such as consumer products and services, new media and entertainment, clean technology and industrial growth, and life sciences. The Wedbush Securities Equity Sales and Trading Group delivers information flow and investment ideas as well as best execution services to small, mid and large cap clients. The group covers more than 1,100 U.S. and European institutions through their Los Angeles, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas and Minneapolis offices and are market makers in over 700 NASDAQ stocks.[8]
The Investment Banking Group provides clients with financing and advisory services while the Fixed Income Group provides investment solutions and financing assistance to private client, institutional, municipal and corporate clients.
Clearing and Technology Group[edit]
The Clearing and Technology Group provides clearing and prime brokerage services for retail broker dealers, institutional firms, black box trading firms, professional trading firms, hedge funds, investment banks, and municipal bond underwriters for a range of services such as prime brokerage and high-frequency trading.
Private Client Services Group[edit]
The Private Client Services Group provides brokerage, advisory products, and services to private and institutional clients, including wealth management, retirement planning, investment management and financial planning.
Legal disputes[edit]
In 2011 it was ordered to pay a former bond trader $3.5 million in withheld compensation[9] for "morally reprehensible" conduct, and was ordered to pay an investor about $2.9 million after an arbitration panel decided that a customer's account had been "churned" and looted by a former Wedbush broker.[9]
On October 20, 2011 it was revealed that Wedbush securities is taking legal action against liquidnet inc for alleged violation of trade secrets.[10]
Recent awards[edit]

Barron's ranks Wedbush Securities as the number 1 stock picking firm in 2011 [7]
Wall Street Journal’s Best on the Street 2011 ranked Wedbush analysts #3 in Alternative Energy, Household & Personal Products and #5 in Aerospace & Defense.[11]
In 2010, The Financial Times and Starmine ranked Wedbush analysts #1 top earnings estimators in Biotechnology and Diversified Consumer Services and #3 in Communication Equipment.[12]
Forbes ranked Wedbush analysts #1 in Computer Software & Services, #3 in Semiconductors, Apparel and Soap & Cosmetics in 2010.[13]

History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1955 by two high school friends, Edward W. Wedbush and Robert Werner, in Los Angeles, California. They each contributed $5,000 to capitalize their new company, Wedbush & Company.[1] The company was named after Wedbush because neither partner wanted a possible business failure named after them and Wedbush lost a coin toss.[2]
Wedbush opened its first office in 1957 located in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles. Three years later, Robert Werner decided to sell his interest in the firm to Ed Wedbush.[3] In 1971, the firm became members of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). In 1972, the firm began offering correspondent clearing services, providing trade execution for other brokerage firms.[4] The firm also added an Investment Banking group in 1975.




Headquarters building at 1000 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles


Wedbush expanded their trading and research capabilities and added several retail brokerage offices.[5] In 2000, the firm launched BrokerInsight, a workstation for order entry, portfolio valuation, and account management and in 2006, the firm became the #1 Liquidity Provider on NASDAQ. In late 2009, the firm changed its name to Wedbush Securities Inc. from Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc.
On June 13, 2011, Wedbush Securities' parent company, Wedbush Inc. announced the acquisition of Lime brokerage, a provider of low-latency, high-throughput trading technologies and high-volume agency brokerage.[6]
Barron's released the research results conducted by Zacks Investment Research for top stock picking firms. Zack's scored Wedbush as the number one stock picking firm for three of their four survey periods. Barron's announced that, "Los Angeles-based Wedbush Securities surfed to top honors by wide margins over the 6, 12 and 36 months ended Dec. 31, 2011." [7]
Corporate divisions[edit]
The firm is organized into three main divisions: Capital Markets, Clearing and Technology, and Private Client Services.
Capital Markets Group[edit]
Wedbush Securities’ Research platform consists of over 25 analysts, coverage of more than 300 stocks, a consumer channel checking team and Wedbush Decision Metrics (primary, survey-based research). The Equity Research team provides insights into emerging investment opportunities within sectors such as consumer products and services, new media and entertainment, clean technology and industrial growth, and life sciences. The Wedbush Securities Equity Sales and Trading Group delivers information flow and investment ideas as well as best execution services to small, mid and large cap clients. The group covers more than 1,100 U.S. and European institutions through their Los Angeles, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas and Minneapolis offices and are market makers in over 700 NASDAQ stocks.[8]
The Investment Banking Group provides clients with financing and advisory services while the Fixed Income Group provides investment solutions and financing assistance to private client, institutional, municipal and corporate clients.
Clearing and Technology Group[edit]
The Clearing and Technology Group provides clearing and prime brokerage services for retail broker dealers, institutional firms, black box trading firms, professional trading firms, hedge funds, investment banks, and municipal bond underwriters for a range of services such as prime brokerage and high-frequency trading.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
