TTX for chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain


    WEX also plans to file a protocol with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our second indication, TTX for chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. This is a randomized, double-blind, dose-finding, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of the potential efficacy and safety of TTX in patients with CINP. This Phase II study will take place at approximately 20 sites in the United States (US), a total of 275 patients will be enrolled. Currently this clinical trial is ongoing in the United States.
 Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is an area of unmet medical need for patients treated with some of the most common cancers.  The pain that is associated with chemotherapy is a condition that seriously impacts day-to-day function after therapy. A majority of patients treated with two widely-used classes of chemotherapy – the platinums (such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin) and the taxanes (such as paclitaxel and docetaxel) – experience neuropathic pain that can be debilitating and/or dose-limiting for chemotherapy treatment.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Product Type Controls




Product type controls offer an advantage to Merchant Category controls. While others can control which merchant type can be accessed (ie: restaurants), WEX takes it a step further, and controls which products can be purchased at outlets such as service stations. When the card is swiped, merchant product codes automatically compare the purchase against pre-set card profile limits. If the product types are allowed and the set limits have not been exceeded, we authorize the transaction, and the merchant completes the sale. If the card is beyond the limits, it will be declined.
You can set overall limits for all purchases for a specific time period — daily, weekly, twice monthly, or monthly; and your fleet's total purchases for that period — transactions per period, dollars per period and gallons/units per period.

TTX for cancer-related pain


					Our first indication, TTX for cancer-related pain, is in Phase III clinical development in Canada. This study is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of TTX to placebo with moderate to severe inadequately controlled cancer-related pain. The primary endpoint is a composite of pain outcome and quality of life measurements using validated pain assessment tools. The secondary endpoints include the onset and duration of pain relief.
				
Cancer-related pain

				At present, the management of severe cancer pain generally includes the use of morphine and other opiates. This can often result in undesirable side effects, and treatment with this type of medication is not always effective, one in four patients using opioids to manage cancer-pain fails opioid therapy. Because currently available pain-relieving therapy is unsatisfactory for many patients, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches for the management of moderate or severe cancer pain. 
				 
				In addition to the unmet medical need, the number of patients suffering from cancer continues to grow. In North America alone, based on estimates provided by the American Cancer Society and the Canadian Cancer Society, 1,650,350 were diagnosed with cancer in the United States and Canada in 2009. Between 75% and 90% of patients with metastatic or advanced stage cancer will experience significant cancer-related pain.
