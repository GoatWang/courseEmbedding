            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Sequoia was founded by Don Valentine in 1972[7] in Menlo Park, California. In the mid-1990s, Valentine gave control of the company to Doug Leone and Michael Moritz.[3] In 1999, Sequoia expanded its operations to Israel.[8] Sequoia Capital China was established in 2005 as an affiliate to the U.S. firm.[9] In 2006, Sequoia Capital acquired Westbridge Capital Partners, an Indian venture capital firm. It later was renamed Sequoia Capital India.[10] CB Insights recognized Sequoia Capital as the number one venture capital firm in 2013.[11] The U.S. firm had 11 partners as of 2016.[12]
In 2015, Sequoia drew criticism[13][14] after Moritz responded to questions about why the U.S. firm had never had a female investing partner by saying Sequoia was looking for women to hire, but "[w]hat we’re not prepared to do is to lower our standards."[15] Members of the media, technology and investment communities criticized the statements as suggesting "smart, driven, capable young women interested in working in technology...don’t exist."[16] Moritz subsequently issued a statement saying, "I know there are many remarkable women who would flourish in the venture business" and said the firm was working to find them.[17] In 2016, Sequoia hired Polyvore CEO Jess Lee, 33, as an investing partner, making her Sequoia's first female investing partner[18] as well as one of its youngest partners.[12]
Investments[edit]
The firm invests in both public and private companies. It specializes in incubation, seed stage, startup stage, early stage, and growth stage investments in private companies.[19] The company invests mainly in companies based in the United States for early and seed stage investments. It invests between $100,000 and $1 million in "seed" stage, between $1 million and $10 million in early stage, and between $10 million and $100 million in companies that are in their growth stage.[20]
Sequoia Capital has invested in over 250 companies since 1972, including Apple, Google, Oracle, PayPal, Stripe, YouTube, Instagram, Yahoo! and WhatsApp.[21] The combined current public market value for these companies is over $1.4 trillion, equivalent to 22 percent of Nasdaq.[3] Its portfolio is mainly in financial services, healthcare, outsourcing and technology.[19] As in 2017, they have exited in 68 IPOs and 203 acquisitions.[22]

History[edit]
Sequoia was founded by Don Valentine in 1972[7] in Menlo Park, California. In the mid-1990s, Valentine gave control of the company to Doug Leone and Michael Moritz.[3] In 1999, Sequoia expanded its operations to Israel.[8] Sequoia Capital China was established in 2005 as an affiliate to the U.S. firm.[9] In 2006, Sequoia Capital acquired Westbridge Capital Partners, an Indian venture capital firm. It later was renamed Sequoia Capital India.[10] CB Insights recognized Sequoia Capital as the number one venture capital firm in 2013.[11] The U.S. firm had 11 partners as of 2016.[12]
In 2015, Sequoia drew criticism[13][14] after Moritz responded to questions about why the U.S. firm had never had a female investing partner by saying Sequoia was looking for women to hire, but "[w]hat we’re not prepared to do is to lower our standards."[15] Members of the media, technology and investment communities criticized the statements as suggesting "smart, driven, capable young women interested in working in technology...don’t exist."[16] Moritz subsequently issued a statement saying, "I know there are many remarkable women who would flourish in the venture business" and said the firm was working to find them.[17] In 2016, Sequoia hired Polyvore CEO Jess Lee, 33, as an investing partner, making her Sequoia's first female investing partner[18] as well as one of its youngest partners.[12]
Investments[edit]
The firm invests in both public and private companies. It specializes in incubation, seed stage, startup stage, early stage, and growth stage investments in private companies.[19] The company invests mainly in companies based in the United States for early and seed stage investments. It invests between $100,000 and $1 million in "seed" stage, between $1 million and $10 million in early stage, and between $10 million and $100 million in companies that are in their growth stage.[20]
Sequoia Capital has invested in over 250 companies since 1972, including Apple, Google, Oracle, PayPal, Stripe, YouTube, Instagram, Yahoo! and WhatsApp.[21] The combined current public market value for these companies is over $1.4 trillion, equivalent to 22 percent of Nasdaq.[3] Its portfolio is mainly in financial services, healthcare, outsourcing and technology.[19] As in 2017, they have exited in 68 IPOs and 203 acquisitions.[22]

No word yet on if this represents a final close, or if the fund size could climb even higher.The University of Michigan Regents, a longtime investor with Sequoia, described the fund strategy in a memo last July:Sequoia Capital 2010, L.P.,  a fund sponsored by Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm headquartered in Menlo Park, CA, will invest in early and growth stage companies located in the U.S. and in China. Sequoia Capital 2010 is a continuation of Sequoia's long- established strategy to invest in early and growth stage technology companies in the U.S. and its more recent strategy to expand its investment portfolio to include early and growth stage technology and consumer companies in China. Sequoia 2010, L.P.  is Sequoia's first vintage fund and affords the opportunity for global investing by local teams of professionals who benefit from access to Sequoia's firm resources and proven investment model for founding highly successful companies.In the U.S., venture investments will be primarily in new technology companies formed in the western part of the country, particularly California's Silicon Valley.  The China investments will focus on companies positioned to benefit from China's growing economy and increasing number of consumers and are expected to be in the financial services, consumer services, technology, and healthcare, and internet sectors. This is the University's ninth investment with Sequoia Capital.I've requested comment from Sequoia, and will update this post if it responds.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

We are excited about its decision to participate in our fast-growing asset management business," said Wang Jingbo, chairman and CEO of Noah.Sequoia Capital China's founding managing director Neil Shen said in a statement that he believes there is significant potential for accelerated growth for Gopher and tremendous synergies between Gopher and the venture firm.Sequoia will help Gopher expand its product domestically and internationally as Chinese high net worth individuals continue to diversify their investments to overseas assets.Gopher was founded in March 2010 and specializes in fund-of-funds management in the private equity, real estate, hedge funds, credit products and family office businesses.Founded in 2005, Noah provides wealth and asset management services for high net worth individuals and enterprises in China.In the second quarter of 2016, Noah distributed over RMB27.7 billion (US$4.2 billion) of wealth management products.    asset managementwealth management 5shares Weibo Facebook3 Twitter0 Google+1 LinkedIn1 Related News    Most Popular News ⇨    With Porn Banned In China, Taiwanese Firm To Release First Chinese Adult VR Movie 1.5KShares     Five Chinese Electric Vehicle Start-Ups That Could Rival Tesla 1.2KShares     Stop Creating Bike Sharing Companies, China! 881Shares     Why Hong Kong's Government-Led Innovation Drive Is Failing 856Shares     In Shanghai, A Bike-Sharing Start-Up Discovers Users Don't Want To Share 821Shares     This $3B Chinese Tech Company Wants To Bend, Curve And Roll The World Up 651Shares      Latest News UpdatesChinese Cloud Mobile Operating System Haimawan Raises $58M In New RoundHaimawan, a cloud-based mobile operating system developer, has raised RMB360 million (US$58 million) in a series C round from investors … Xiaomi Refinances $1 Billion Syndicated Loan To Fuel GlobalizationMatrix Joins $17M Round In Chinese Smart Auto Parts Supply Chain Firm AutocloudProHony Capital, SoftBank Inject $500M To Fuel WeWork's Expansion In ChinaBike Sharing Makes Chinese Exports Cool For First Time Since Marco PoloDespite being an export powerhouse, Chinese products have largely been run-of-the-mill stuff like cloth, shoes and toys.
