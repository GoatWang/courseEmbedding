	PRELIMINARY
	PROSPECTUS







	SUBJECT
	TO COMPLETION, JANUARY 13, 2017

	HOLDINGS CORPORATION





	 





	9,038,520
	Shares





	 





	IEG
	Holdings Corporation





	 





	Common
	Stock





	 








	This
	prospectus relates to the resale of up to 9,038,520 shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders named in this prospectus.
	This prospectus may be used by the selling stockholders named herein to resell, from time to time, those shares of our common
	stock included herein. For information about the selling stockholders see “Selling Stockholders” on page 44 .


	 


	Our common stock is presently quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under
	the trading symbol “IEGH”. On January 12, 2017, the last sale price of our common stock as reported by the OTC Markets
	was $5.16 per share with respect to an insignificant volume of shares.







	 





	We
	will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders
	will sell their shares at a fixed price of $10.00


	 


	per
	share for the duration of this offering. See “Determination of Offering Price” and “Plan of Distribution.”




	 




	The
	selling stockholders, and any participating broker-dealers, are deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of
	the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and any commissions or discounts given to any such
	broker-dealer may be regarded as underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. The selling stockholders have
	informed us that they do not have any agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute their
	common stock. We will be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of the registration
	statement of which this prospectus is a part;

	provided, however,

	that we will not be required to pay any underwriters’
	discounts or commissions relating to the securities covered by the registration statement.




	 




	We
	are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and
	we will be subject to reduced public reporting requirements. See “Emerging Growth Company Status.”




	 




	Persons
	effecting transactions in the shares should confirm the registration of these securities under the securities laws of the states
	in which transactions occur or the existence of applicable exemptions from such registration.




	 





	THE
	SHARES BEING OFFERED ARE SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY BY PERSONS WHO CAN AFFORD
	THE LOSS OF THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. SEE “RISK FACTORS” BEGINNING ON PAGE 4 OF THIS PROSPECTUS FOR A DISCUSSION OF
	INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES.





	 





	NEITHER
	THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR
	PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.





	 




	You
	should rely only on the information contained in this prospectus. We have not, and the selling stockholders have not, authorized
	anyone to provide you with different information from that contained in this prospectus or in any free writing prospectus that
	we may authorize. The information contained in this prospectus is accurate only as of the date of this prospectus, regardless
	of the time of delivery of this prospectus or of any sale of our common stock. This prospectus does not constitute an offer to
	sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities in any circumstances under which the offer or solicitation is unlawful.
	Neither the delivery of this prospectus nor any distribution of securities in accordance with this prospectus shall, under any
	circumstances, imply that there has been no change in our affairs since the date of this prospectus.




	 





	The
	date of this prospectus is ____________________, 2017.

	No

	contained in this prospectus in connection with the offer made by this prospectus and, if given or made, such information or representations
	must not be relied upon as having been authorized by us or the selling stockholders. This prospectus does not constitute an offer
	to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation is not
	authorized or in which the person making such offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so, or to any person to whom it is
	unlawful to make such offer or solicitation. Neither the delivery of this prospectus nor any sale made hereunder shall, under
	any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no change in our affairs or that information contained herein is
	correct as of any time subsequent to the date hereof.





	 





	For
	investors outside the United States: We have not and the selling stockholders have not done anything that would permit this offering
	or possession or distribution of this prospectus in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required, other than in
	the United States. Persons outside the United States who come into possession of this prospectus must inform themselves, and observe
	any restrictions relating to, the offering of the shares of our common stock and the distribution of this prospectus outside the
	United States.

	CAUTIONARY
	STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	 




	This
	prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus includes “forward-looking statements” within
	the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements
	we make concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures,
	financing needs and other information that is not historical information. Some forward-looking statements appear under the headings
	“Prospectus Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	and Results of Operations” and “Business.” When used in this prospectus, the words “estimates,”
	“expects,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “plans,” “intends,”
	“believes,” “foresees,” “seeks,” “likely,” “may,” “might,”
	“will,” “should,” “goal,” “target” or “intends” and variations of
	these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions of any such words) are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
	All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to us on the date of this prospectus.




	 




	We
	have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. However, these forward-looking
	statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of our control, that could cause actual
	results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements, including, among other things, the
	matters discussed in this prospectus in the sections captioned “Prospectus Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business.” Some of the factors
	that we believe could affect our results include:




	 






	●




	limitations
	on our ability to continue operations and implement our business plan;






	 




	 






	●




	our
	history of operating losses;






	 




	 






	●




	the
	timing of and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms;






	 




	 






	●




	the
	effects of changing economic conditions;






	 




	 






	●




	the
	loss of members of the management team or other key personnel;






	 




	 






	●




	competition
	from larger, more established companies with greater economic resources than we have;






	 




	 






	●




	costs
	and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims, which may not be covered
	by insurance;






	 




	 






	●




	costs
	and damages relating to pending and future litigation;






	 




	 






	●




	the
	impact of additional legal and regulatory interpretations and rulemaking and our success in taking action to mitigate such
	impacts;






	 




	 






	●




	control
	by our principal equity holders; and






	 




	 






	●




	the
	other factors set forth herein, including those set forth under “Risk Factors.”






	 




	There
	are likely other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking

	PROSPECTUS
	SUMMARY





	 





	This
	summary highlights material information concerning our business and this offering. This summary does not contain all of the information
	that you should consider before making your investment decision. You should carefully read the entire prospectus and the information
	incorporated by reference into this prospectus, including the information presented under the section entitled “Risk Factors”
	and the financial data and related Notes, before making an investment decision. This summary contains forward-looking statements
	that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from future results contemplated in the forward-looking
	statements as a result of factors such as those set forth in “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding
	Forward-Looking Statements.” All historical information in this prospectus has been adjusted to reflect (i) the 1-for-6
	reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock that was effective February 22, 2013, (ii) the 1-for-100 reverse stock split
	of our outstanding common stock that was effective June 17, 2015 and (iii) the net 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our outstanding
	common stock that was effective October 27, 2016.





	 





	In
	this prospectus, unless the context indicates otherwise, “IEG Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,”
	“our,” “ours” or “us” refer to IEG Holdings Corporation, a Florida corporation, and its subsidiaries.





	 





	Our
	Company





	 



	We provide unsecured online
	consumer loans under the brand name “Mr. Amazing Loans” via our website and online application portal at

	www.mramazingloans.com

	.
	We started our business and opened our first office in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2010. We currently offer $5,000 and $10,000 unsecured
	consumer loans that mature in five years. We are currently licensed and originating direct consumer loans in 19 states
	– Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey,
	New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia. We provide loans to residents of these states through
	our online application portal, with all loans originated, processed and serviced out of our centralized Las Vegas head office,
	which eliminates the need for physical offices in all of these states.



	 




	Our
	strategy is to address the funding needs of “under-banked” consumers that tend to be ignored by mainstream institutional
	credit providers such as traditional banks and credit unions, and charged high advanced fees and interest by fringe lenders such
	as payday lenders. In the current economic environment, we believe there is a substantial need for the small personal loans that
	we offer.




	 




	All
	of our personal loans are offered at less than prevailing maximum statutory rates with fixed repayments and no prepayment penalties.
	We conduct full underwriting on all applications, including credit checks and review of bank statements to ensure customers have
	the capacity to repay their loans.




	 



	We plan to continue expanding
	our state coverage in 2017 by obtaining state lending licenses in an additional six states, increasing our coverage to
	25 states. As soon as we receive new state licenses, we are prepared to re-focus our existing online marketing and distribution
	channel resources to those states, which we expect will continue to lower our average customer acquisition cost.



	 




	For
	the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we generated revenue of $1,835,165 and $529,225, respectively, and had net losses
	of $5,698,198 and $5,401,754, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated revenue of $1,627,879
	and $1,327,329, respectively, and had net losses of $3,185,760 and $4,239,353, respectively.




	 




	We
	were organized as a Florida corporation on January 21, 1999, originally under the name Interact Technologies, Inc. In February
	2013, we changed our name to IEG Holdings Corporation. We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Investment Evolution Corporation
	(“IEC”), our U.S. operating entity that holds all of our state licenses, leases, employee contracts and other operating
	and administrative assets, and IEC SPV, LLC (“IEC SPV”), a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that holds our
	U.S. loan receivables.




	 




	Our
	principal office is located at 6160 West Tropicana Avenue, Suite E-13, Las Vegas, Nevada 89103 and our phone number is (702) 227-5626.
	Our corporate website address is

	www.investmentevolution.com

	is not a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this prospectus.




	 





	Tender
	Offer for Shares of OneMain Holdings, Inc. Common Stock





	 




	On
	January 5, 2017, we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to all outstanding shares of common stock of OneMain Holdings Inc.,
	a NYSE-listed company;

	provided, however,

	that we are willing to accept any number of shares of OneMain common stock, even
	if such shares, in the aggregate, constitute less than a majority of OneMain’s outstanding common stock (the “OneMain
	Tender Offer”). The OneMain Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 12:00 Midnight Eastern time on Monday, February 6, 2017
	unless it is extended or earlier terminated. Complete terms and conditions of the OneMain Tender Offer are set forth in the Tender
	Offer Statement on Schedule and in the registration statement on Form S-4, which we filed with the SEC on January 5, 2017. This
	description and other information in this prospectus regarding the OneMain Tender Offer is included in this prospectus solely
	for informational purposes. Nothing in this prospectus should be construed as an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of an offer
	to buy, any shares in connection with the OneMain Tender Offer.




	 





	Emerging
	Growth Company Status





	 




	We
	are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart
	Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions
	from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies”
	including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
	reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation
	and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We elected to take advantage of all of these
	exemptions.




	 







	 


	 

	1



	 







	 





	 




	In
	addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended
	transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards,
	and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have
	elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.




	 




	We
	will be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common
	equity offering, although we will lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0
	billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in
	Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.

	RISK
	FACTORS





	 





	Investment
	in our securities involves a number of substantial risks. You should not invest in our securities unless you are able to bear
	the complete loss of your investment. In addition to the risks and investment considerations discussed elsewhere in this prospectus,
	the following factors should be carefully considered by anyone purchasing the securities offered through this prospectus. The
	risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
	to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur,
	our business could be harmed. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or
	a part of their investment.





	 





	Risks
	Related to Our Business and Industry





	 






	Our
	limited operating history and our failure since inception to achieve an operating profit makes our future prospects and financial
	performance unpredictable.






	 




	We
	commenced operations in 2010 and as a result, we have a limited operating history upon which a potential investor can evaluate
	our prospects and the potential value of an investment in our company. In addition, we have not made an operating profit since
	our incorporation. We remain subject to the risks inherently associated with new business enterprises in general and, more specifically,
	the risks of a new financial institution and, in particular, a new Internet-based financial institution. Our prospects are subject
	to the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development, including the risk that
	we will not be able to implement our business strategy. If we are unable to implement our business strategy and grow our business,
	our business will be materially adversely affected.




	 






	We
	may not be able to implement our plans for growth successfully, which could adversely affect our future operations.






	 




	Since
	January 2015, the amount we have loaned to borrowers (our loan book) has increased by 147% from $5,549,023 to $13,684,023 as of
	September 30, 2016. We expect to continue to grow our loan book and number of customers at an accelerated rate following completion
	of this Offering. Our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to manage our growth. We may not be able to
	achieve our growth plans, or sustain our historical growth rates or grow at all. Various factors, such as economic conditions,
	regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede our ability to expand our market presence. If we are
	unable to grow as planned, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.




	 






	Our
	inability to manage our growth could harm our business.






	 




	We
	anticipate that our loan book and customer base will continue to grow significantly over time. To manage the expected growth of
	our operations and personnel, we will be required to, among other things:




	 






	 




	●




	improve
	existing and implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	maintain
	effective credit scoring and underwriting guidelines; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	increase
	our employee base and train and manage this growing employee base.






	 




	If
	we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
	affected.




	 






	We
	may need to raise additional capital that may not be available, which could harm our business.






	 




	Our
	growth will require that we generate additional capital either through retained earnings or the issuance of additional debt or
	equity securities. Additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any equity financings could result
	in dilution to our stockholders or reduction in the earnings available to our common stockholders. If adequate capital is not
	available or the terms of such capital are not attractive, we may have to curtail our growth and our business, and our business,
	prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.




	 







	 


	 

	4



	 







	 





	 






	As
	an online consumer loan company whose principal means of delivering personal loans is the Internet, we are subject to risks particular
	to that method of delivery.






	 




	We
	are predominantly an online consumer loan company and there are a number of unique factors that Internet-based loan companies
	face. These include concerns for the security of personal information, the absence of personal relationships between lenders and
	customers, the absence of loyalty to a conventional hometown branch, customers’ difficulty in understanding and assessing
	the substance and financial strength of an online loan company, a lack of confidence in the likelihood of success and permanence
	of online loan companies and many individuals’ unwillingness to trust their personal details and financial future to a relatively
	new technological medium such as the Internet. As a result, some potential customers may be unwilling to establish a relationship
	with us.




	 




	Conventional
	“brick and mortar” consumer loan companies, in growing numbers, are offering the option of Internet-based lending
	to their existing and prospective customers. The public may perceive conventional established loan companies as being safer, more
	responsive, more comfortable to deal with and more accountable as providers of their lending needs. We may not be able to offer
	Internet-based lending that has sufficient advantages over the Internet-based lending services and other characteristics of conventional
	“brick and mortar” consumer loan companies to enable us to compete successfully.




	 






	We
	may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete
	with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.






	 




	Both
	the Internet and the financial services industry are undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new
	technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving the ability to serve customers, the effective use of technology
	increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability
	to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands,
	as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven
	products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. If we are unable, for technical,
	legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions, customer requirements or emerging
	industry standards, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.




	 






	A
	significant disruption in our computer systems or a cyber security breach could adversely affect our operations.






	 




	We
	rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our loan origination and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage
	or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber security breaches, vandalism,
	severe weather conditions, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities.
	If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair
	or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions,
	which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any compromise of our security could also result in a violation
	of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the
	information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.




	 






	Our
	ability to protect the confidential information of our borrowers and investors may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, computer
	viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions.






	 




	We
	process certain sensitive data from our borrowers and investors. While we have taken steps to protect confidential information
	that we receive or have access to, our security measures could be breached. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other
	unauthorized access to our systems could cause confidential borrower and investor information to be stolen and used for criminal
	purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the
	loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because
	of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited,
	our relationships with borrowers and investors could be severely damaged, and we could incur significant liability.




	 




	Because
	techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until
	they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
	In addition, federal regulators and many federal and state laws and regulations require companies to notify individuals of data
	security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement
	and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause borrowers and investors to lose confidence in the effectiveness
	of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation, we could lose borrowers
	and investors and our business and operations could be adversely affected.




	 




	Any
	significant disruption in service on our platform or in our computer systems, including events beyond our control, could prevent
	us from processing or posting payments on loans, reduce the attractiveness of our marketplace and result in a loss of borrowers
	or investors.

	In
	the event of a system outage and physical data loss, our ability to perform our servicing obligations, process applications or
	make loans available would be materially and adversely affected. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of
	our technology are critical to our operations, customer service, reputation and our ability to attract new and retain existing
	borrowers and investors.




	 




	Any
	interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party error, our error, natural disasters or security breaches,
	whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with our borrowers and investors and our reputation. Additionally,
	in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur.
	Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover
	all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from processing or posting payments on the loans,
	damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees’ attention, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause
	borrowers and investors to abandon our marketplace, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
	results of operations.




	 






	Our
	unsecured loans generally have delinquency and default rates higher than prime and secured loans, which could result in higher
	loan losses.






	 




	We
	are in the business of originating unsecured personal loans. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 2.33% of our customers are
	subprime borrowers, which we define as borrowers having credit scores below 600 on the credit risk scale developed by VantageScore
	Solutions, LLC. Unsecured personal loans and subprime loans generally have higher delinquency and default rates than secured loans
	and prime loans. Subprime borrowers are associated with lower collection rates and are subject to higher loss rates than prime
	borrowers. Subprime borrowers have historically been, and may in the future become, more likely to be affected, or more severely
	affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions, particularly unemployment. If our borrowers default under an unsecured loan, we
	will bear a risk of loss of principal, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations. Delinquency interrupts the
	flow of projected interest income from a loan, and default can ultimately lead to a loss. We attempt to manage these risks with
	risk-based loan pricing and appropriate management policies. However, we cannot assure you that such management policies will
	prevent delinquencies or defaults and, if such policies and methods are insufficient to control our delinquency and default risks
	and do not result in appropriate loan pricing, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be
	harmed. If aspects of our business, including the quality of our borrowers, are significantly affected by economic changes or
	any other conditions in the future, we cannot be certain that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing
	loans will adequately adapt to such changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such
	changes affect our borrowers’ capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity
	could be materially adversely affected. At September 30, 2016, we had 199 loans considered past due at 31+ days past due, representing
	10.54% of the number of loans in our active portfolio. At September 30, 2016, we had 97 loans delinquent or in default (defined
	as 91+ days past due) representing 5.09% of the number of loans in our active portfolio. Loans become eligible for a lender to
	take legal action at 60 days past due.




	 






	If
	our estimates of loan receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for loan receivable losses would
	increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.






	 




	We
	maintain an allowance for loans receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for loan receivable losses,
	we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect loan receivable collectability, including the total amount
	of loan receivables outstanding, historical loan receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends.
	If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate, housing
	foreclosures, and general economic uncertainty may affect our allowance for loan receivable losses, our provision may be inadequate.
	Our allowance for loan receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual loan receivable losses are materially greater than our
	allowance for loan receivable losses, our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations could be adversely affected.




	 






	Our
	risk management efforts may not be effective which could result in unforeseen losses.






	 




	We
	could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage,
	monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related
	risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. Our risk management policies, procedures,
	and techniques, including our scoring methodology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate
	the risks we have identified or identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.

	We
	face strong competition for customers and may not succeed in implementing our business strategy.






	 




	Our
	business strategy depends on our ability to remain competitive. There is strong competition for customers from personal loan companies
	and other types of consumer lenders, including those that use the Internet as a medium for lending or as an advertising platform.
	Our competitors include:




	 






	 




	●




	large,
	publicly-traded, state-licensed personal loan companies such as OneMain;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	peer-to-peer
	lending companies such as LendingClub Corp. and Prosper Marketplace Inc.;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	online
	personal loan companies such as Avant;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	“brick
	and mortar” personal loan companies, including those that have implemented websites to facilitate online lending; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	payday
	lenders, tribal lenders and other online consumer loan companies.






	 




	Some
	of these competitors have been in business for a long time and have name recognition and an established customer base. Most of
	our competitors are larger and have greater financial and personnel resources. In order to compete profitably, we may need to
	reduce the rates we offer on loans, which may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
	To remain competitive, we believe we must successfully implement our business strategy. Our success depends on, among other things:




	 






	 




	●




	having
	a large and increasing number of customers who use our loans for financing needs;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	our
	ability to attract, hire and retain key personnel as our business grows;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	our
	ability to secure additional capital as needed;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	our
	ability to offer products and services with fewer employees than competitors;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	the
	satisfaction of our customers with our customer service;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	ease
	of use of our websites; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	our
	ability to provide a secure and stable technology platform for providing personal loans that provides us with reliable and
	effective operational, financial and information systems.






	 




	If
	we are unable to implement our business strategy, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could
	be adversely affected.




	 






	We
	depend on third-party service providers for our core operations including online lending and loan servicing, and interruptions
	in or terminations of their services could materially impair the quality of our services.






	 




	We
	rely substantially upon third-party service providers for our core operations, including online web lending and marketing and
	vendors that provide systems that automate the servicing of our loan portfolios which allow us to increase the efficiency and
	accuracy of our operations. These systems include tracking and accounting of our loan portfolio as well as customer relationship
	management, collections, funds disbursement, security and reporting. This reliance may mean that we will not be able to resolve
	operational problems internally or on a timely basis, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction or long-term disruption of
	our operations. If these service arrangements are terminated for any reason without an immediately available substitute arrangement,
	our operations may be severely interrupted or delayed. If such interruption or delay were to continue for a substantial period
	of time, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.




	 






	If
	we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.






	 




	Our
	future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our Chief Executive Officer, Paul Mathieson and
	our Chief Operating Officer, Carla Cholewinski. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and
	retain key personnel. We do not maintain any “key man” or other related insurance. The loss of the service of our
	Chief Executive Officer or our Chief Operating Officer, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed,
	could materially harm our business.

	We
	have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs as a result of being a public reporting company.






	 




	In
	April 2015, we became a public reporting company. As a public reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other
	expenses that we did not incur as a non-reporting company, including costs associated with our SEC reporting requirements. We
	expect that the additional reporting and other obligations imposed on us under the Exchange Act, will increase our legal and financial
	compliance costs and the costs of our related legal, accounting and administrative activities significantly. Management estimates
	that compliance with the Exchange Act reporting requirements as a reporting company will cost in excess of $200,000 annually.
	Given our current financial resources, these additional compliance costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial
	position and ability to achieve profitable results. These increased costs will require us to divert money that we could otherwise
	use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives.




	 






	We
	operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse
	effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.






	 




	The
	consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to originate consumer loan
	receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar
	products and services in originating loan receivables. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing
	resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be
	available to us. While banks and credit card companies have decreased their lending to non-prime customers in recent years, there
	is no assurance that such lenders will not resume those lending activities. Further, because of increased regulatory pressure
	on payday lenders, many of those lenders are starting to make more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory
	scrutiny of their practices, which could increase competition in markets in which we operate.




	 






	Negative
	publicity could adversely affect our business and operating results.






	 




	Negative
	publicity about our industry or our company, including the quality and reliability of our marketplace, effectiveness of the credit
	decisioning and scoring models used in the marketplace, changes to our marketplace, our ability to effectively manage and resolve
	borrower and investor complaints, privacy and security practices, litigation, regulatory activity and the experience of borrowers
	and investors with our marketplace or services, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in,
	and the use of, our marketplace, which could harm our business and operating results. Harm to our reputation can arise from many
	sources, including employee misconduct, misconduct by our partners, outsourced service providers or other counterparties, failure
	by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality, inadequate protection of borrower and investor information
	and compliance failures and claims.




	 






	Our
	business is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.






	 




	Our
	operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and
	regulations. In most states in which we operate, a consumer credit regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to consumer
	lenders such as us. These rules and regulations generally provide for licensing as a consumer lender, limitations on the amount,
	duration and charges, including interest rates, for various categories of loans, requirements as to the form and content of finance
	contracts and other documentation, and restrictions on collection practices and creditors’ rights. In certain states, we
	are subject to periodic examination by state regulatory authorities. Some states in which we operate do not require special licensing
	or provide extensive regulation of our business.




	 




	We
	are also subject to extensive federal regulation, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the
	Fair Credit Reporting Act. These laws require us to provide certain disclosures to prospective borrowers and protect against discriminatory
	lending and leasing practices and unfair credit practices. The principal disclosures required under the Truth in Lending Act include
	the terms of repayment, the total finance charge and the annual percentage rate charged on each contract or loan. The Equal Credit
	Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national
	origin, sex, age or marital status. According to Regulation B promulgated under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, creditors are
	required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise consumers whose credit applications are not approved
	of the reasons for the rejection. In addition, the credit scoring system used by us must comply with the requirements for such
	a system as set forth in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires us to provide
	certain information to consumers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a report obtained from a consumer
	reporting agency and to respond to consumers who inquire regarding any adverse reporting submitted by us to the consumer reporting
	agencies. Additionally, we are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires us to maintain the privacy of certain consumer
	data in our possession and to periodically communicate with consumers on privacy matters. We are also subject to the Servicemembers
	Civil Relief Act, which requires us, in most circumstances, to reduce the interest rate charged to customers who have subsequently
	joined, enlisted, been inducted or called to active military duty.

	A
	material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, lawsuits and damage to our
	reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.




	 






	The
	Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) is a new federal agency formed pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
	Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), and there continues to be uncertainty as to how
	the agency’s actions or the actions of any other new agency could impact our business.






	 




	The
	CFPB, constituted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, which commenced operations in 2011, has broad authority over the business in
	which we engage. This includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth
	in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and to enforce those laws against and examine financial institutions for
	compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory,
	supervisory and enforcement authority. To assist in its enforcement, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows
	consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the loan products we facilitate. This
	system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its regulatory, enforcement or examination focus.




	 




	We
	are subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction, including its enforcement authority, as a servicer and acquirer of consumer credit.
	The CFPB may request reports concerning our organization, business conduct, markets and activities. The CFPB may also conduct
	on-site examinations of our business on a periodic basis if the CFPB were to determine, through its complaint system, that we
	were engaging in activities that pose risks to consumers.




	 




	There
	continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s strategies and priorities, including in both its examination and enforcement
	processes, will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements
	to alter or cease offering affected loan products and services, making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer
	them.




	 




	Actions
	by the CFPB or other regulators against us or our competitors that discourage the use of the marketplace model or suggest to consumers
	the desirability of other loan products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of borrowers or investors. Our
	compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if the CFPB or other regulators enact new regulations, change
	regulations that were previously adopted, modify, through supervision or enforcement, past regulatory guidance, or interpret existing
	regulations in a manner different or stricter than have been previously interpreted.




	 






	If
	our involvement in a December 11, 2014 article published in the Examiner or any other publicity regarding our company or the Offering
	during the waiting period, including our December 2, 2014 press release, were held to be in violation of federal or state securities
	laws, we could incur monetary damages, fines or other damages that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
	and prospects.






	 




	On
	December 11, 2014, information about our company was published in an article by the Examiner. Our Chief Executive Officer, Mr.
	Mathieson, did not participate in an interview with the author of the Examiner article. Rather, the author included certain quotations
	from Mr. Mathieson that were contained in prior press releases by us and summarized statements previously made by Mr. Mathieson
	that were contained in a prior article published by the Opportunist Magazine. Prior to its publication, the author of the December
	11

	th

	article provided Mr. Mathieson a copy of the article.




	 




	In
	addition, we issued a press release on December 2, 2014 in which we referenced, among other things, our intention to file a registration
	statement on Form S-1 and to list our securities on NASDAQ. The December 2

	nd

	press release presented certain statements
	about our company in isolation and did not disclose many of the related risks and uncertainties described in this Private Placement
	Memorandum.




	 




	If
	it were determined that the December 11

	th

	article, the December 2

	nd

	press release or any of our other publicity-related
	activities constituted a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, the SEC and relevant state regulators could impose monetary
	fines or other sanctions as provided under relevant federal and state securities laws. Such regulators could also require us to
	make a rescission offer, which is an offer to repurchase the Notes purchased in this Offering. This could also give rise to a
	private right of action to seek a rescission remedy under Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act.




	 




	We
	are unable to quantify the extent of any monetary damages that we might incur if monetary fines were imposed, rescission were
	required or one or more other claims were successful. As of the date of this Offering memorandum, we are not aware of any pending
	or threatened claims alleging violations of any federal or state securities laws. However, there can be no assurance that any
	such claim will not be asserted in the future or that the claimant in any such action will not prevail. The possibility that such
	claims may be asserted in the future will continue until the expiration of the applicable federal and state statutes of limitations,
	which generally vary from one to three years from the date of sale. If the payment of damages or fines is significant, it could
	have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition or prospects.

	Risks
	Relating to Our Common Stock





	 






	Trading
	on the OTC Markets is volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for
	our security holders to resell their common stock



	.





	 



	Our common stock is currently
	quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets. Trading in securities quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized
	by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors, some of which may have little to do with our operations or business
	prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance.
	Moreover, the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the
	trading of securities listed on a stock exchange like NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange. These factors may result in investors
	having difficulty reselling any shares of our common stock.



	 






	Our
	common stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of several factors, including a limited public float.






	 




	The
	market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly
	volatile in the future. You may not be able to resell shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the
	market’s adverse reaction to volatility.




	 




	Other
	factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things:




	 






	 




	●




	actual
	or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	the
	absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	we
	may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	overall
	stock market fluctuations;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	announcements
	concerning our business or those of our competitors;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	actual
	or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	conditions
	or trends in the industry;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	litigation;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	changes
	in market valuations of other similar companies;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	future
	sales of common stock;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	departure
	of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	general
	market conditions.






	 




	Any
	of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market
	in general has at times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to
	the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our
	common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.

	Our
	common stock has been in the past, and may be in the future, a “penny stock” under SEC rules. It may be more difficult
	to resell securities classified as “penny stock.”






	 




	In
	the past, our common stock has been a “penny stock” under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange
	traded stock with a per-share price below $5.00). Unless we maintain a per-share price above $5.00, these rules impose additional
	sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those
	who qualify as “established customers” or “accredited investors.” For example, broker-dealers must determine
	the appropriateness for non-qualifying persons of investments in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must also provide, prior to a transaction
	in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about
	penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer
	quotations for the penny stock, disclose the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, furnish
	monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account, provide a special
	written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchaser’s written
	agreement to the transaction.




	 




	Legal
	remedies available to an investor in “penny stocks” may include the following:




	 






	 




	●




	If
	a “penny stock” is sold to the investor in violation of the requirements listed above, or other federal or states
	securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel the purchase and receive a refund of the investment.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	If
	a “penny stock” is sold to the investor in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and
	firms that committed the fraud for damages.






	 




	However,
	investors who have signed arbitration agreements may have to pursue their claims through arbitration.




	 




	These
	requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that
	becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage
	broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our
	securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability
	to resell our common stock.




	 




	Many
	brokerage firms will discourage or refrain from recommending investments in penny stocks. Most institutional investors will not
	invest in penny stocks. In addition, many individual investors will not invest in penny stocks due, among other reasons, to the
	increased financial risk generally associated with these investments.




	 




	For
	these reasons, penny stocks may have a limited market and, consequently, limited liquidity. We can give no assurance that our
	common stock will not become classified as a “penny stock” in the future.




	 






	If
	we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the price of our securities may be adversely affected.






	 




	Our
	internal control over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the
	disclosure of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate
	internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established,
	could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.
	In addition, management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions
	that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors.
	Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or
	disclosure of management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the
	price of our common stock.




	 






	We
	are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and if we fail to continue to comply,
	our business could be harmed and the price of our securities could decline.






	 




	Rules
	adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require an annual assessment of internal control over financial
	reporting, and for certain issuers (but not us) an attestation of this assessment by the issuer’s independent registered
	public accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting
	as effective are evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed
	standards. We expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is
	difficult for us to predict how long it will take or costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our
	internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial
	reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In the event
	that our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not
	effective as defined under Section 404, we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our securities
	will be affected; however, we believe that there is a risk that investor confidence and the market value of our securities may
	be negatively affected.

	Our
	Chief Executive Officer has voting control, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions,
	including a change in control.






	 



	As of January 12, 2017,
	Mr. Mathieson beneficially owned 6,900,000 shares of our common stock, which represents 71.03 % of our outstanding common
	stock. As a result, Mr. Mathieson controls a majority of our voting power and therefore is able to control all matters submitted
	to our stockholders for approval. Mr. Mathieson may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you
	disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated voting power may have the effect of delaying, preventing
	or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their
	capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.



	 




	As
	a board member, Mr. Mathieson owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
	believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Mathieson is entitled to vote his shares in his
	own interest, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.




	 






	Shares
	eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.





	 


	From time to time, certain
	of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions
	in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant
	to Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months, subject only to the current public information requirement.
	Affiliates may sell after six months, subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information,
	and notice requirements. Of the approximately 9,714,186 shares of our common stock outstanding as of January 12, 2017,
	approximately 2,759,986 shares are tradable without restriction. Given the limited trading of our common stock, resale of even
	a small number of shares of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or an effective registration statement may adversely affect
	the market price of our common stock.







	 






	Provisions
	of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a takeover which may
	not be in the best interests of our stockholders.






	 




	Provisions
	of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and our amended and restated bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover
	effects, which include when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a
	takeover attempt. In addition, certain provisions of the Florida Business Corporations Act also may be deemed to have certain
	anti-takeover effects which include that control of shares acquired in excess of certain specified thresholds will not possess
	any voting rights unless these voting rights are approved by a majority of a corporation’s disinterested stockholders. Further,
	our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred
	stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors in their sole discretion.
	Our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue series of preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion,
	voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.




	 






	As
	an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.






	 




	We
	qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely
	on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required
	to:




	 






	 




	●




	have
	an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	comply
	with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation
	or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial
	statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);






	 







	 


	 

	12



	 







	 





	 




	 






	 




	●




	submit
	certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency”;
	and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	disclose
	certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons
	of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.






	 




	In
	addition, Section 102 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
	period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words,
	an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply
	to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our consolidated financial
	statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.




	 




	We
	will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
	fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated
	filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that
	is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter
	or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.




	 




	Until
	such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.
	If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common
	stock and the price of our securities may be more volatile.





	 









	USE
	OF PROCEEDS





	 




	We
	will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders in this offering. See “Selling Stockholders.”





	 







	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 


	The shares being offered
	by the selling stockholders will be sold at a fixed price of $10.00 for the duration of this offering. The offering price of the
	shares bears no relation to book value, assets, earnings, or any other objective criteria of value. It has been arbitrarily determined
	by the selling stockholders.





	 










	PLAN
	OF DISTRIBUTION





	 




	This
	prospectus relates to 9,038,520 shares of our common stock offered by the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders and any
	of their respective pledges, donees, assignees and other successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all
	of their shares of common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private
	transactions.




	 



	These shares
	shall be sold at a fixed price of $10.00 for the duration of this offering. The offering price of the shares bears no
	relation to book value, assets, earnings, or any other objective criteria of value. It has been arbitrarily determined by the
	selling stockholders. The selling stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:



	 






	●




	 




	ordinary
	brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;






	 




	 




	 






	●




	 




	block
	trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent, but may position and resell a portion of the block
	as principal to facilitate the transaction;






	 




	 




	 






	●




	 




	purchases
	by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;






	 




	 




	 






	●




	 




	an
	exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;






	 




	 




	 






	●




	 




	privately
	negotiated transactions;






	 




	 




	 






	●




	 




	short
	sales;






	 




	 




	 






	●




	 




	broker-dealers
	may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;






	 




	 




	 






	●




	 




	through
	the writing of options on the shares;






	 




	 




	 






	●




	 




	a
	combination of any such methods of sale; and






	 




	 




	 






	●




	 




	any
	other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.






	 







	 


	 

	13



	 







	 





	 




	The
	selling stockholders or any of their respective pledgees, donees, transferees or other successors-in-interest, may also sell the
	shares directly to market makers acting as principals and/or broker-dealers acting as agents for themselves or their customers.
	Such broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling stockholders
	and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agents or to whom they sell as principal or both, which
	compensation as to a particular broker-dealer might be in excess of customary commissions. Before any such agent, or broker-dealer
	sells any of the shares that are the subject of this prospectus, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement of which
	this prospectus forms a part will be filed to name anyone receiving compensation for selling the shares before any sales take
	place. Market makers and block purchasers purchasing the shares will do so for their own account and at their own risk. It is
	possible that a selling stockholder will attempt to sell shares of common stock in block transactions to market makers or other
	purchasers at a fixed price which may be below or above the then market price. The selling stockholders and any brokers, dealers
	or agents, upon effecting the sale of any of the shares offered in this prospectus, are “underwriters” as that term
	is defined under the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations under such acts. In such event, any commissions
	received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting
	commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.




	 




	Discounts,
	concessions, commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, attributable to the sale of shares will be borne by the respective
	selling stockholder. A selling stockholder may agree to indemnify any agent, dealer or broker-dealer that participates in transactions
	involving sales of the shares if liabilities are imposed on that person under the Securities Act.




	 




	The
	selling stockholders may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of common stock owned
	by them and, if a selling stockholder defaults in the performance of its secured obligations, the pledgee or secured parties may
	offer and sell the shares of common stock from time to time under this prospectus after we have filed an amendment to this prospectus
	under Rule 424(b)(3) or any other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending the list of selling stockholders to include
	the pledgee, transferee or other successors-in-interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus.




	 




	The
	selling stockholders also may transfer their shares of common stock in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees
	or other successors-in-interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus and may sell the shares
	of common stock from time to time under this prospectus after we have filed an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3)
	or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee
	or other successors-in-interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus.




	 




	We
	are required to pay all fees and expenses incident to the registration of the shares of common stock. We have agreed to indemnify
	the selling stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.




	 




	The
	selling stockholders acquired the securities offered hereby in the ordinary course of business and have advised us that they have
	not entered into any agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriters or broker-dealers regarding the sale of
	their shares of common stock, nor is there an underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with a proposed sale of
	shares of common stock by any selling stockholder. If we are notified by any selling stockholder that any material arrangement
	has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of shares of common stock, if required, we will file a supplement to this
	prospectus.




	 




	If
	a selling stockholder uses this prospectus for any sale of the shares of common stock, it will be subject to the prospectus delivery
	requirements of the Securities Act.




	 




	The
	anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act may apply to sales of our common stock and activities
	of the selling stockholders.





	 









	DIVIDEND
	POLICY





	 




	Historically,
	we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We expect to change our dividend policy in 2017, however, and intend
	to pay a small dividend to stockholders in April 2017 after our first quarter 2017 results are released. We expect to pay ongoing
	regular quarterly dividends thereafter. Payment of future dividends on our common stock, if any, will be at the discretion of
	our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial
	condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We may determine to retain
	future earnings, if any, for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business.

	Market
	Information





	 




	Our
	common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets under the symbol “IEGH.” The OTC Market
	is a network of security dealers who buy and sell stock. The dealers are connected by a computer network that provides information
	on current “bids” and “asks”, as well as volume information.




	 




	The
	following table sets forth the range of high and low closing bid quotations for our common stock for each of the periods indicated
	as reported by the OTC Markets. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission
	and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. As of June 17, 2015, we effected a 1-for-100 reverse stock split of our
	outstanding shares. We also completed a 1-for-100 reverse stock split and a 100-for-1 forward stock split, both effective March
	28, 2016, and a net 1-for-10 reverse stock split effective October 27, 2016. All prices in the following table reflect post- split
	prices.

	The
	volume of our shares traded on the OTC Markets was insignificant and therefore, we do not believe the prices represent a reliable
	indication of the fair market value of these shares. We sold shares of common stock in private placements during 2014 at prices
	ranging from $5.00 per share to $20.00 per share, during 2015 at prices ranging from $10.00 per share to $50.00 per share, and
	in 2016 at prices ranging from $10.00 to $50.00 per share.




	 





	Holders
	of Common Stock





	 




	As
	of January 12, 2017, there were approximately 675 record holders of our common stock. The number of record holders
	does not include beneficial owners of common stock whose shares are held in the names of banks, brokers, nominees or other fiduciaries.




	 




	We
	have no securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans.





	 









	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION






	AND
	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 




	The
	following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
	financial statements and the Notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our discussion
	includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives,
	expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
	statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Risk Factors, Cautionary Statement Regarding
	Forward-Looking Statements and Business sections in this prospectus. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,”

	Overview





	 




	We
	are a consumer finance company providing responsible online personal loan products to customers in 17 states via our website and
	online application portal. We provide unsecured loans to individuals. Our $5,000 and $10,000 online personal loans range from
	19.9% to 29.9% APR and all are unsecured over a five-year term. We have a 6-year track record of high quality origination, underwriting
	and servicing of personal loans to underbanked consumers. We leverage our experience and knowledge in the consumer finance industry
	to achieve a meaningful return on our investment in the loan portfolio.




	 




	We
	have the ability to finance our businesses from a diversified source of capital and funding, including financings in the capital
	markets. During 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, we demonstrated the ability to attract capital markets funding for our
	core personal loans by completing private placements of common stock and preferred stock.




	 




	We
	operate in one business segment: Consumer Loans.




	 






	Nine
	Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015






	 





	Interest
	Revenue





	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest revenue increased to $1,586,723, compared to $1,298,112 for the nine months
	ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to the growth in our interest-earning loan book of consumer receivables. We expect
	our interest revenue to grow significantly in future periods as we continue to grow our loan book.




	 





	Other
	Revenue





	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other revenue increased to $41,156, compared to $29,217 for the nine months ended September
	30, 2015. Other revenue consisted of decline lead revenue, late/dishonor fees, loss recovery and stock application/processing
	fees. The increase was attributable to an increase in loss recovery.




	 





	Salaries
	and Compensation Expenses





	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, salaries and compensation expenses decreased to $1,207,124, compared to $1,551,382 for
	the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the cessation of employment for our VP Corporate
	Finance and zero payment of bonuses in Q3 2016 compared to payments in Q3 2015.




	 







	Other
	Operating Expenses





	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other operating expenses increased to $1,134,836, compared to $905,721 for the nine
	months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was attributable to the higher legal and accounting costs associated with our SEC
	filings in the period.




	 





	Consulting
	Fees





	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consulting fees decreased to $867,723, compared to $905,002 for the nine months ended
	September 30, 2015. The decrease was attributable to timing of capital raising fees incurred with less new equity being raised
	in the period.




	 





	Provision
	for Credit Losses





	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for credit losses expense increased to $1,000,344, compared to $793,619
	for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We carry a provision for credit losses which is estimated collectively based on
	our loan portfolio and general economic conditions. The increase in provision for credit losses from prior year was due to the
	larger loans receivable outstanding balance at September 30, 2016 compared to loans receivable outstanding at September 30, 2015
	and an increase in loans charged off during the first quarter of 2016.




	 





	Advertising





	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, advertising expenses decreased to $313,902, compared to $527,452 for the nine months
	ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was attributable to the reduction in customer acquisition costs incurred to grow the loan
	book, including online advertising, direct mail, and lead generation costs.

	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, rent expense decreased to $154,838, compared to $187,975 for the nine months ended September

	Meals and Entertainment





	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, travel, meals and entertainment expenses increased to $139,253, compared to $101,628
	for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Travel, meals and entertainment expenses include corporate travel for meetings and
	investor presentations, as well as other investor related expenses. The increase was due to the significant increase in investor
	roadshows conducted by the CEO in the period compared to the previous period.

	and Amortization





	 




	For

	Other
	Revenue





	 




	For
	the three months ended September 30, 2016, other revenue increased to $10,000, compared to $9,894 for the three months ended September

	For
	the three months ended September 30, 2016, consulting fees increased to $414,443, compared to $282,189 for the three months ended

	For
	the three months ended September 30, 2016, travel, meals and entertainment expenses decreased to $13,085, compared to $25,718
	for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Travel, meals and entertainment expenses include corporate travel for meetings

	For
	the three months ended September 30, 2016, depreciation and amortization marginally decreased to $3,212, compared to $4,192 for

	Financial
	Position





	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	We
	had cash and cash equivalents of $924,552 as of September 30, 2016, compared to $485,559 as of December 31, 2015. The increase
	was due to increased equity capital raised in the period.




	 





	Loans
	Receivable





	 




	We
	had net loan receivables of $7,250,691 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $7,124,702 as of December 31, 2015. The increase
	was due to greater loan originations in the period versus repayment of loan principal by customers.




	 





	Other
	Receivables





	 




	We
	had other receivables of $141,325 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $76,262 as of December 31, 2015. Other receivables
	comprised outstanding invoices for decline lead revenue due from marketing partners and accrued interest receivable on our consumer
	loans at September 30, 2016. The increase in other receivables is primarily due to the refund of unused research services and
	increase in accrued interest receivable.




	 





	Property
	and Equipment





	 




	We
	had net property and equipment of $20,895 as of September 30, 2016 as compared to $28,511 as of December 31, 2015. The minimal
	movement was in line with expectations and a direct result of recording depreciation expense for the period plus a loss of $571
	on disposal of assets.

	had accounts payable and accrued expenses of $66,119 as of September 30, 2016, compared to $96,441 as of December 31, 2015. The
	decrease was due to management’s decision to pay a number of September expenses in full in the current period so accrual
	was not required for those expenses.

	the year ended December 31, 2015, interest revenue increased to $1,789,701, compared to $521,018 for the year ended December 31,

	decline lead revenue through improved decline lead monetization processes combined with increased loan application volumes.




	 





	Salaries
	and Compensation Expenses





	 




	For
	the year ended December 31, 2015, salaries and compensation expenses increased to $2,126,243, compared to $1,889,136 for the year

	significantly larger net loans receivable outstanding balance of $7,124,702 at December 31, 2015 compared to net loans receivable
	outstanding of $4,316,316 at December 31, 2014.

	had net property and equipment of $28,511 as of December 31, 2015 as compared to $36,100 as of December 31, 2014. The minimal
	movement was in line with expectations.




	 





	Loan
	Costs





	 




	Our
	net loan costs decreased from $77,781 as of December 31, 2014 to $0 as of December 31, 2015 due to the full amortization of capitalized
	loan cost upon the full repayment of the BFG loan facility in August 2015.




	 





	Accounts
	Payable and Accrued Expenses





	 




	We
	had accounts payable and accrued expenses of $96,441 as of December 31, 2015, compared to $172,139 as of December 31, 2014. The
	decrease was due to management’s decision to pay a number of December expenses in full in the current period so no accrual
	required.




	 





	CEO
	Accrued Wages





	 




	We
	had CEO accrued wages of $0 as of December 31, 2015, compared to $106,588 as of December 31, 2014. The reduction in accrued wages
	is due to CEO wages being paid in full in the current period and so no accrual required.




	 





	Senior
	Debt





	 




	We
	had senior debt of $0 as of December 31, 2015 and $2,230,000 as of December 31, 2014. This senior debt comprised advances from
	our $10 million revolving facility. This credit facility was converted into a term loan in July 2015 and was fully repaid on August
	21, 2015.





	 







	Financial
	Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources





	 




	We
	continue to incur operating expenses in excess of net revenue but cash flow from our existing loan receivables repayments plus
	net revenue exceed budgeted cash operating expenses for the next 12 months. To expand operations we will require capital infusions
	until operating results improve. We may not be able to obtain such capital in a timely manner and as a result may incur liquidity
	imbalances.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 





	Nine
	Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015





	 




	We
	used cash in operations of $2,095,725 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,948,727 during the nine
	months ended September 30, 2015, and this decrease is in line with expectations due to the continued growth of our revenue. We
	used cash in investing activities of $1,126,332 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3,256,639 of cash
	used during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a
	decrease in loans receivable originated.




	 




	We
	were provided $3,661,050 of net cash from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7,469,636
	during the same period in 2015. The funds were attributable to proceeds from preferred stock and common stock received and was
	a decrease from the corresponding period in 2015.




	 




	At
	September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $924,552, which when added to budgeted cash inflows from loans receivable repaid and
	budgeted cash inflows from revenues, is sufficient to meet our operating needs for the next 12 months.




	 




	The
	principal conditions/events that raise substantial doubt of the company’s ability to meet its obligations are i) the Company
	has reported recurring losses and ii) the Company has not yet generated positive net cash flows from operations. However, the
	Company has increased its revenue, management’s plans for the next 12 months alleviate the substantial doubt and management
	evaluates that as a result of these plans the Company can meet all its obligations through October 2017. Without raising additional
	debt or equity capital, management’s plans include reducing advertising costs to significantly reduce loan originations
	and related loan processing costs. There would also be a significant reduction in consulting and professional fees without additional
	capital being raised. Management’s plans also include utilizing the funds received from loan principal repayments for operating
	expenses rather than investing in loan origination. In addition, significant core operating costs have been cut from the Company
	in 2016 including reducing the number of employees from 12 to 7 due to increased automation of loan origination processes and
	reducing the number of office leases from 4 to 1 in the past quarter as old leases expired. While the Company has sufficient cash
	on hand at September 30, 2016 combined with anticipated cash flow from loan repayments to continue operations for at least 12
	months, the Company intends, over the next 12 months, to seek additional capital via unsecured notes to expand operations and
	the Company has shown the capacity to raise substantial equity capital over the past few years and, although not the current plan,
	could seek additional equity capital if required.

	On
	August 21, 2015, we, through certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries, paid an aggregate of $1,676,954, representing all principal
	and accrued interest under the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended (the “Loan Agreement”), among BFG and certain
	of our wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, there is currently no outstanding balance under the Loan Agreement. However, the
	Loan Agreement continues in effect and we are subject to a net profit interest under which we are required to pay BFG 20% of the
	“Net Profit” of its subsidiary, IEC SPV, LLC, until 10 years from the date the loan is repaid in full (August 2015).
	Net Profit is defined as the gross revenue less (i) interest paid on the loan, (ii) payments on any other debt incurred as a result
	of refinancing the loan through a third party, as provided in the Loan Agreement, (iii) any costs, fees or commissions paid on
	the existing credit facility, and (iv) charge-offs to bad debt resulting from consumer loans and reduced by servicing fee. The
	Net Profit arrangement can be terminated by us upon a payment of $3,000,000 to BFG. Net profit interest for the nine months ended
	September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $96,083 and $69,297, respectively. All loans receivable of the Company were pledged as collateral
	at September 30, 2016 for the fulfillment of the Net Profit calculation. As of September 30, 2016, $58,885 has been paid and $37,198
	was fully accrued for.




	 





	Year
	Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014





	 




	We
	used cash in operations of $3,959,568 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $3,302,159 during the year ended December
	31, 2014, and this increase is in line with expectations due to the continued growth or our loan book and associated higher operating
	expenses. We used net cash from investing activities of $4,057,025 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $4,513,954
	during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to an increase in
	loans receivable repaid from the larger loan book.




	 




	We
	were provided $8,068,440 of net cash from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $7,967,946
	during the year ended December 31, 2014. The funds were attributable to proceeds from preferred stock and proceeds from common
	stock received in the year ended December 31, 2015 and was a minimal change from the corresponding period in 2014.




	 




	At
	December 31, 2015, we had cash on hand of $485,559, which is not sufficient to meet our operating needs for the next 12 months.
	We plan to continue to raise the required capital to meet our operating needs via equity capital raisings.




	 




	On
	April 13, 2015, the Company secured a $200,000 working capital loan to expand from Dr. L. Prasad, an investor in the Company.
	On June 24, 2015, the Company repaid $230,000 which comprised $200,000 principal and a $30,000 facility fee which was recorded
	as interest expense.




	 




	On
	April 13, 2015, the Company secured a $100,000 working capital loan to expand from Domenic Tacca, an investor in the Company.
	On June 24, 2015, the Company repaid $115,000 which comprised $100,000 principal and a $15,000 facility fee which was recorded
	as interest expense.




	 




	On
	April 13, 2015, the Company secured a $100,000 working capital loan to expand from CT Super, an investor in the Company. On June
	24, 2015, the Company repaid $115,000 which comprised $100,000 principal and a $15,000 facility fee which was recorded as interest
	expense.




	 




	The
	Company had a credit facility that provided for borrowings of up to $10 million with $0 outstanding at December 31, 2015 and $2,230,000
	outstanding at December 31, 2014, subject to a borrowing base formula. The Company could borrow, at its option, at the rate of
	18% with a minimum advance of $25,000. Proceeds from this credit facility were used to fund loans to consumers. In July 2015,
	the credit facility was converted to a term loan, to be repaid monthly, with payments equal to 100% of the consumer loan proceeds,
	with the balance due June 1, 2016. The credit facility was repaid in full on August 21, 2015.




	 




	The
	credit facility remains subject to a net profit interest under which the Company will pay BFG Loan Holdings, LLC, 20% of its subsidiary
	IEC SPV’s “Net Profit” until 10 years from the date the loan was repaid in full. Net Profit is defined as the
	gross revenue less (i) interest paid on the loan, (ii) payments on any other debt incurred as a result of an approved Refinance
	Event, (iii) any costs, fees or commissions paid on the existing credit facility, and (iv) charge-offs to bad debt resulting from
	consumer loans. If the Refinance event shall be approved by BFG Loan Holdings, LLC and occur as set forth in the agreement, the
	net profit percentage shall be reduced to 10%. The Net Profit arrangement can be terminated by the Company upon a payment of $3,000,000.
	Net profit interest for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $107,340 and $0, respectively. All loans receivable of the
	company are pledged as collateral at December 31, 2015 for the fulfillment of the Net Profit calculation.

	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	As
	of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
	to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
	operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term “off-balance sheet
	arrangement” generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated
	with us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest
	or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity
	or market risk support for such assets.




	 





	Basis
	of Accounting





	 




	These
	consolidated financial statements include the operations of IEG Holdings Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Investment
	Evolution Corporation and IEC SPV, LLC (collectively, the “Company”). All inter-company transactions and balances
	have been eliminated in consolidation.




	 




	The
	Company’s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform
	to general practices within the consumer finance industry.




	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect any possible future
	effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities.




	 




	The
	principal conditions/events that raise substantial doubt of the company’s ability to meet its obligations are i) the Company
	has reported recurring losses and ii) the Company has not yet generated positive net cash flows from operations. However, the
	Company has increased its revenue, management’s plans for the next 12 months alleviate the substantial doubt and management
	evaluates that as a result of these plans the Company can meet all its obligations through October 2017. Without raising additional
	debt or equity capital, management’s plans include reducing advertising costs to significantly reduce loan originations
	and related loan processing costs. There would also be a significant reduction in consulting and professional fees without additional

	in 2016 including reducing the number of employees from 12 to 7 due to increased automation of loan origination processes and

	months, the Company intends, over the next 12 months, to seek additional capital via unsecured notes to expand operations and
	the Company has shown the capacity to raise substantial equity capital over the past few years and, although not the current plan,
	could seek additional equity capital if required.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies





	 




	We
	have identified the following policies below as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted
	by the application of the following accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments.
	These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact
	quarterly or annual results of operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly
	as expected, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies
	are described in the following paragraphs.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Management
	uses its historical records and knowledge of its business in making these estimates. Accordingly, actual results may differ from
	these estimates.




	 







	 


	 

	23



	 







	 





	 





	Loans
	Receivable and Interest Income





	 




	The
	Company offers its loans at or below the prevailing statutory rates. Loans are carried at the unpaid principal amount outstanding,
	net of an allowance for credit losses.




	 




	The
	Company calculates interest revenue using the interest yield method. Charges for late payments are credited to income when collected.




	 




	Accrual
	of interest income on loans receivable is suspended when no payment has been received on account for 91 days or more on a contractual
	basis, at which time a loan is considered delinquent. Payments received on nonaccrual financing loans are first applied to the
	unpaid accrued interest and then principal. Loans are returned to active status and accrual of interest income is resumed when
	all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current; at which time management believes future payments
	are reasonably assured. At September 30, 2016, 97 loans with a total balance of $433,781 were delinquent or in default. At December
	31, 2015, 111 loans with a total balance of $543,054 were delinquent or in default.




	 





	Allowance
	for Credit Losses





	 




	The
	Company maintains an allowance for credit losses due to the fact that it is probable that a portion of the loans receivable will
	not be collected. The allowance is estimated by management based on various factors, including specific circumstances of the individual
	loans, management’s knowledge of the industry, and the experience and trends of other companies in the same industry.




	 




	Our
	portfolio of loans receivable consists of a large number of relatively small, homogenous accounts. The allowance for credit losses
	is determined using a systematic methodology, based on a combination of historical bad debt of comparable companies and industry
	index. Impaired loans are considered separately and 100% charged off.




	 




	The
	allowance for credit losses is primarily based upon models that analyze specific portfolio statistics and also reflect, management’s
	judgment regarding overall accuracy. We take into account several factors, including the customer’s transaction history,
	specifically the timeliness of customer payments, the remaining contractual term of the loan, and the outstanding balance of the
	loan.




	 





	Concentration
	of Credit Risks





	 




	As
	of September 30, 2016, the Company’s portfolio of finance receivables is with consumers living throughout Alabama, Arizona,
	California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas,
	Utah, and Virginia and consequently such consumers’ ability to honor their installment contracts may be affected by economic
	conditions in these areas.




	 




	The
	Company maintains cash at financial institutions which may, at times, exceed federally insured limits.




	 





	Impaired
	Loans





	 




	The
	Company assesses loans for impairment individually when a loan is 91 days past due. The Company defines impaired loans as bankrupt
	accounts and accounts that are 184 days or more past due. In accordance with the Company’s charge-off policy, once a loan
	is deemed uncollectible, 100% of the remaining balance is charged-off. Loans can also be charged off when deemed uncollectable
	due to consumer specific circumstances.




	 




	The
	Company does not accrue interest on impaired loans and any recoveries of impaired loans are recorded to the allowance for credit
	losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying statement of operations.




	 







	Property
	and Equipment





	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are being provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
	useful lives of the assets as follows:




	 






	Classification




	 




	Life






	Computer
	equipment




	 




	3-5
	years






	Furniture
	and fixtures




	 




	8
	years







	 







	 


	 

	24



	 







	 





	 




	The
	Company amortizes its leasehold improvements over the shorter of their economic lives, which are generally five years, or the
	lease term that considers renewal periods that are reasonably assured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
	as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated
	depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.




	 





	Operating
	Leases





	 




	The
	Company’s office leases all expire (unless renewed) during 2016.




	 





	Loan
	Costs





	 




	Loan
	costs consisted of broker success fees and legal fees related to the credit facility. These costs were amortized over the period
	of the credit facility.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	We
	account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	740 “Income Taxes”. To date, no current income tax liability has been recorded due to our accumulated net losses.
	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
	of assets and liabilities and the amounts that are reported in the income tax returns. Our net deferred income tax assets have
	been fully reserved by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income and to recover
	our net deferred income tax assets.




	 





	Advertising
	Costs





	 




	Advertising
	costs are expensed as incurred.




	 





	Earnings
	and Loss per Share





	 




	The
	Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10 that establishes standards for computing and presenting
	net earnings (loss) per shares. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average
	number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share
	except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
	the potential common shares, if any, had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Basic and diluted loss
	per share has been adjusted retroactively for the 1-for-100 reverse split that occurred on June 17, 2015 and for the net 1-for-10
	reverse split that occurred on October 27, 2016.




	 





	Reclassifications





	 




	Certain
	numbers from the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.




	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	Carrying
	amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value
	because of their immediate or short-term nature. The fair value of borrowings is not considered to be significantly different
	than its carrying amount because the stated rates for such debt reflect current market rates and conditions.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	The
	recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require
	adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

	DESCRIPTION
	OF BUSINESS





	 





	Business
	Overview





	 




	We
	provide unsecured online consumer loans under the brand name “Mr. Amazing Loans” via our website and online application
	portal at

	www.mramazingloans.com

	. We started our business and opened our first office in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2010. We
	currently offer $5,000 and $10,000 unsecured consumer loans that mature in five years. We are currently licensed and originating
	direct consumer loans in 19 states – Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,
	Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia. We provide loans
	to residents of these states through our online application portal, with all loans originated, processed and serviced out of our
	centralized Las Vegas head office, which eliminates the need for physical offices in all of these states.




	 




	Our
	strategy is to address the funding needs of “under-banked” consumers that tend to be ignored by mainstream institutional
	credit providers such as traditional banks and credit unions, and charged high advanced fees and interest by fringe lenders such
	as payday lenders. In the current economic environment, we believe there is a substantial need for the small personal loans that
	we offer.




	 




	All
	of our personal loans are offered at less than prevailing maximum statutory rates with fixed repayments and no prepayment penalties.
	We conduct full underwriting on all applications, including credit checks and review of bank statements to ensure customers have
	the capacity to repay their loans.




	 




	We
	plan to continue expanding our state coverage by obtaining state lending licenses in an additional six states, increasing
	our coverage to 25 states by mid-2017. As soon as we receive new state licenses, we are prepared to re-focus our existing online
	marketing and distribution channel resources to those states, which we expect will continue to lower our average customer acquisition
	cost.




	 




	For
	the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we generated revenue of $1,835,165 and $529,225, respectively, and had net losses
	of $5,698,198 and $5,401,754, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated revenue of $1,627,879
	and $1,327,329, respectively, and had net losses of $3,185,760 and $4,239,353, respectively.




	 




	We
	were organized as a Florida corporation on January 21, 1999, originally under the name Interact Technologies, Inc. In February
	2013, we changed our name to IEG Holdings Corporation. We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, IEC, our U.S. operating entity that
	holds all of our state licenses, leases, employee contracts and other operating and administrative assets, and IEC SPV, a bankruptcy
	remote special purpose entity that holds our U.S. loan receivables.




	 





	Market





	 




	We
	operate in the consumer finance industry serving the large and growing population of consumers who have limited access to credit
	from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 7.7% (1 in 13) of
	households in the United States were unbanked in 2013. This proportion represented nearly 9.6 million households. According to
	the Center for Financial Services December 2015 report, the rapid rise of short term credit, which grew 37% from 2012 to 2014,
	while single payment credit grew only 0.1% over the same period, is starkly apparent. With anticipated regulatory changes likely
	to alter the feasibility of offering loans due in one lump sum, many companies are investing more heavily in installment-based
	credit products, while new players are seeking to upend the economics of small-dollar loans through online channels and alternative
	underwriting. The strong marketing and new account approval rates of subprime credit cards have also provided consumers with increased
	access to funds available on a short-term basis. Together, these shifts in the consumer lending industry suggest that total revenue
	for short term credit products, sized at $29 billion in 2014, will soon outpace that of single payment credit products, sized
	at $38 billion for the same year. In fact, short term credit products already generate nearly twice as much annual revenue as
	single payment credit products.




	 




	Installment
	lending to non-prime consumers is one of the most highly fragmented sectors of the consumer finance industry. We are a state-licensed
	Internet-based personal loan company serving in the consumer installment lending industry. Our online lending platform provides
	the distribution network to efficiently address this growing market of consumers without the significant costs and overhead associated
	with an extensive branch network. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant growth and expansion opportunity
	created by the continued shift of consumers to online services, such as online banking and in our case online personal loans.




	 



	We are currently licensed
	and providing loans online to residents of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
	Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia, with plans to continue
	to expand across the United States by acquiring additional state lending licenses. The following is a breakdown of our cumulative

	Business
	Strategy





	 




	Our
	business strategy is to lower the cost of providing consumer loans by leveraging our online lending platform and distribution
	network, while continuing to obtain additional state licenses to enable further loan book growth and portfolio diversification.
	Our strategy includes a number of key elements:




	 






	 




	●





	State-Licensed
	Model:

	Our state-licensed business model is a key element of our business strategy. We are currently licensed in Alabama,
	Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico,
	Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia and plan to continue expanding across the United States by acquiring
	additional state lending licenses.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	Online
	Distribution:

	We launched online lending in March 2013 and commenced online advertising in July 2013. Upon fulfillment
	of state regulatory requirements, we received approval from regulators in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia,
	Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas,
	Utah and Virginia to operate solely online in these states. This allows us to fully service all 19 states from our
	centralized Las Vegas headquarters, which we believe is a key competitive advantage over brick and mortar lenders.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	Cost-Effective
	Customer Acquisition:

	Our customer acquisition costs have been reduced significantly since we launched online lending
	and marketing. While traditional forms of direct advertising such as radio and television typically resulted in an 8% to 10%
	acquisition cost, online search engine advertising has averaged 4% to 6%.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	Continue
	to Grow Loan Book:

	Total cumulative loan originations as of September 30, 2016 have increased 147% to $13,684,023 since
	our January 2015 total of $5,549,023. This growth in lending is attributable to launching online lending and joint venturing
	with a number of new marketing partners, however, such past growth is not necessarily indicative or predictive of our future
	results of operation. We also plan to obtain an additional six state lending licenses by mid-2017.






	 





	Competitive
	Strengths





	 




	We
	believe our competitive strengths are:




	 






	 




	●





	Large
	Market and Scope for Growth:

	Large personal and payday loan market in the United States presents opportunity for significant
	growth and expansion.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	Proven
	Business Model:

	Our founder, Chairman and CEO, Paul Mathieson, established a similar business in Australia that forms
	the foundation of our United States business model.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	Regulation:

	We are materially compliant with state lending licenses in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
	Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia,
	and are well positioned for current and future regulatory changes due to ongoing compliance and conservative business model.






	 







	 


	 

	27



	 







	 





	 






	 




	●





	Customer
	Proposition:

	Our unsecured $5,000 and $10,000 installment loans are all offered over five years and feature affordable
	weekly repayments. Rates range from 19.9% - 29.9% APR which make us a low cost alternative to payday loans which have an average
	APR of over 400%.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	Online
	Distribution:

	Special approval has been granted by the Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
	Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia
	regulators to operate our business without a physical office location in each state. As a result, we have closed offices in
	Arizona, Illinois and Florida and moved to full online loan distribution, enabling us to offer loans to residents in all 19
	of our licensed states from our Las Vegas headquarters. We will apply for the same regulatory approval for our six
	additional planned states by mid-2017.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	Customer
	Acquisition:

	We launched online advertising in July 2013 with positive results from search engine cost per click advertising
	and online lead generation. In addition, we engaged a number of new marketing partners in 2014 and 2015, including online
	lead generators and direct mail. All of these avenues provide opportunities for strong growth at low customer acquisition
	costs.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	Barriers
	to Entry:

	We believe that state licensure acts as a barrier to entry into our segment of the consumer loan market. We
	are strongly positioned with approval to operate under 19 state licenses from one centralized head office.






	 





	Products





	 




	We
	currently provide $5,000 and $10,000 online consumer loans unsecured over a five-year term with rates ranging from 19.9% to 29.9%
	annual percentage rate. Our current loan portfolio also includes loans remaining from our previous product offerings which were
	$2,000 to $10,000 loans unsecured over a three- to five-year term.




	 




	Our
	personal loan products are fully amortizing, fixed rate, unsecured installment loans and all loans are offered at prevailing statutory
	rates, with our standard loan product being a 29.9% interest rate and annual percentage rate, fully amortizing, five-year unsecured
	personal loan. The variations from this standard loan product in certain states is due to individual state requirements and to
	comply with our state lending licenses; for example, Florida requires a blended rate which caps the maximum rate on a $5,000 loan
	at 24%.

	We
	commenced originating personal loans online in July 2013. Prior to that, we provided loans to customers via our office network,
	which comprised one office in each state as required by state licensing regulations. Our online loan origination platform now
	means that a qualifying customer can obtain a loan from us without having to come into an office location. We have maintained
	our full underwriting processes, identity verifications and fraud checks to ensure that online customers are verified to the same
	degree that customers were when they obtained a loan in an office. We expect our website and application portal,

	www.mramazingloans.com

	,
	to be a key driver of customer conversions and loan book growth.

	Customer
	Acquisition





	 




	Since
	launching online lending in July 2013, our marketing efforts have been focused on online customer acquisition. We saw significant
	increases in loan applications and inquiries as a result of search engine advertising and commenced banner advertising, remarketing
	and search engine optimization in 2014. We commenced online video advertising in 2015. We have also engaged numerous online lead
	generators who provide personal loan leads on a daily basis with a combination of cost per funded loan and cost per application
	expense. We are continuing to develop relationships with additional lead generation partners to drive further growth. We also
	supplement our online marketing efforts with traditional direct mail advertising.




	 





	Loan
	Underwriting





	 




	Applicants
	apply online providing income, employment and banking information in the pre-approval process. The pre-approval process utilizes
	a soft credit pull, electronic review of 60-90 day banking history and if the applicant successfully meets the minimum pre-approval
	criteria they are invited to proceed. Upon accepting the conditional pre-approval, the applicant authorizes a full credit report
	from Experian and verification of employment. Applicants are provided disclosures and privacy statements during this process.

	the application has been transmitted, a full credit report is obtained and the automated preliminary underwriting is completed
	based on stated income and expense data obtained from the credit report. The automated preliminary underwriting includes, but
	is not limited to, credit score, number of credit inquiries, outstanding unpaid collections, length of credit history, length
	of employment, debt to income ratio and internet protocol, or “IP,” address to verify location of applicant.




	 




	The
	second step in the underwriting process for those applicants that are conditionally approved based on stated income, credit score,
	number of credit inquires, outstanding unpaid collections, length of credit history and length of employments, debt to income
	ratio, IP address, is to validate the actual income (current pay invoices and prior year W-2) and a review of the 60-90 day read-only
	statements from the applicant’s primary bank for satisfactory money management. During this process the pay invoices are
	reviewed for garnishments, hardship loans and other legal liens allowed on wages. Bank statements are transmitted electronically
	directly to underwriting to ensure the integrity of the information. This process allows the underwriter to review the money management
	of every applicant and to assess the ability to take on additional expense. It also provides the underwriter with additional debt
	not found on traditional credit reports such as payday loans, title loans and IRS payments that could affect the ability of the
	applicant to assume additional debt. If all conditions are met as it relates to money management, maximum debt to income, minimum
	length of employment, and satisfactory credit history the underwriter recommends final approval and request to draw documents.




	 




	The
	final step in the underwriting process is to present the completed file to the Chief Credit Officer for final approval and order
	to draw documents. The file is then reviewed for any exceptions to policy, compliance with the underwriting policies and to ensure
	the loan system is reflective of what has been presented by the underwriter. The applicant is then approved for a $5,000 or $10,000
	loan based on income, ability to repay and credit strength. Rate and loan terms are fixed (fixed rate and fixed term can vary
	based on regulatory state maximums) as we do not utilize risk based variable pricing models eliminating the risk of discrimination
	and other compliance related issues.




	 




	The
	closing process is completed by contacting the applicant, communicating the lending decision and reviewing loan terms and conditions.
	Upon acceptance an identity check using Experian’s Precise Identity Screening is completed and if successful loan documents
	are emailed for electronic signature, and returned to us for final verifications, document review and funding.




	 





	Servicing





	 




	All
	of our loan servicing is handled in our centralized Las Vegas head office. All servicing and collection activity is conducted
	and documented using an industry standard loan service software system which handles and records all records and transactions
	of loan originations, loan servicing, collections and reporting.




	 




	Our
	primary third-party servicing arrangement is with CyberRidge, LLC, a company that licenses its consumer loan software to us. We
	use this software for our loan management system. We have a servicing agreement with CyberRidge, LLC which renews automatically
	unless either party notifies the other, at least 60 days prior to the end of the renewal term. We believe the risk of termination
	is low as we are a paying customer of CyberRidge, LLC and have maintained a positive working relationship since 2012. In the unlikely
	event that the agreement was terminated, we believe 60 days’ notice would be sufficient to find a suitable replacement with
	minimal disruption to our business.

	Regulation





	 




	Consumer
	loans in the United States are regulated at both the federal and state level. National oversight is provided by the Federal Trade
	Commission, which enforces the following credit laws that protect consumers’ rights to get, use and maintain credit:




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Truth in Lending Act promotes the informed use of consumer credit, by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost to standardize
	the manner in which costs associated with borrowing are calculated and disclosed.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Fair Credit Reporting Act promotes the accuracy and privacy of information in the files of the nation’s credit reporting
	companies. If a company denies an application, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act consumers have the right to the name and
	address of the credit reporting company they contacted, provided the denial was based on information given by the credit reporting
	company.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Equal Opportunity Credit Act prohibits credit discrimination on the basis of sex, race, marital status, religion, national
	origin, age, or receipt of public assistance. Creditors may ask for this information (except religion) in certain situations,
	but they may not use it to discriminate against consumers when deciding whether to grant you credit.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Fair Credit Billing Act and Electronic Fund Transfer Act establish procedures for resolving mistakes on credit billing and
	electronic fund transfer account statements.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”) applies to personal, family, and household debts. The FDCPA prohibits
	debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices while collecting these debts.






	 




	In
	addition, the CFPB, a federal oversight body organized in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act has broad authority over our business.
	The CFPB is a new agency which commenced operations in 2011, and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the agency’s
	actions or the actions of any other new agency could impact our business or that of our issuing banks. The CFPB has the authority
	to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity
	Act, and to enforce those laws against and examine financial institutions for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent “unfair,
	deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. To assist in its
	enforcement, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer
	finance products, including the loan products we facilitate. This system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its
	regulatory, enforcement or examination focus.




	 




	We
	are subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction, including its enforcement authority, as a servicer and acquirer of consumer credit.
	The CFPB may request reports concerning our organization, business conduct, markets and activities. The CFPB may also conduct
	on-site examinations of our business on a periodic basis if the CFPB were to determine, through its complaint system, that we
	were engaging in activities that pose risks to consumers.




	 




	There
	continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s strategies and priorities, including in both its examination and enforcement
	processes, will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements
	to alter or cease offering affected loan products and services, making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer
	them.

	Competition





	 




	We

	include:




	 






	 




	●




	large,
	publicly-traded, state-licensed personal loan companies,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	peer-to-peer
	lending companies, such as Lending Club and Prosper,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	online
	personal loan companies, such as Avant,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	“brick
	and mortar” personal loan companies, including those that have implemented websites to facilitate online lending, and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	payday
	lenders, tribal lenders and other online consumer loan companies.






	 




	We
	believe we compete based on affordable repayment terms, favorable interest rates and low overhead due to on-line distribution.
	We believe that in the future we will face increased competition from these companies as we expand our operations. Most of the
	entities against which we compete, or may compete, are larger and have greater financial resources than us. No assurance can be
	given that increased competition will not have an adverse effect on our company.




	 




	Tender Offer for Shares of OneMain Holdings, Inc. Common
	Stock



	 


	On January 5, 2017,
	we commenced the OneMain Tender Offer, which is scheduled to expire at 12:00 Midnight Eastern time on Monday, February 6, 2017
	unless it is extended or earlier terminated. Complete terms and conditions of the OneMain Tender Offer are set forth in the Tender
	Offer Statement on Schedule and in the registration statement on Form S-4, which we filed with the SEC on January 5, 2017. This
	description and other information in this prospectus regarding the OneMain Tender Offer is included in this prospectus solely
	for informational purposes. Nothing in this prospectus should be construed as an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of an offer
	to buy, any shares in connection with the OneMain Tender Offer.



	 





	Office
	Location





	 




	Our
	executive office, which also serves as our centralized operational headquarters and Nevada branch, is located at 6160 West Tropicana
	Ave, Suite E-13, Las Vegas, Nevada 89103. This facility occupies a total of approximately 2,125 square feet under a lease that
	expires in September 2017. Our annual rental cost for this facility is approximately $56,313, plus a proportionate share of operating
	expenses of approximately $12,112 annually. We believe this facility is adequate for our current and near term future needs due
	to our online strategy and our ability to operate 7 days a week with unrestricted hours of operation from this location.





	 







	Employees





	 




	As
	of January 12, 2017, we had six full-time employees and one part-time employee. None of our employees is represented by
	a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.




	 





	Corporate
	History





	 




	We
	were organized as a Florida corporation on January 21, 1999, under the name Interact Technologies, Inc. (“Interact”).
	Interact was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain medical technology. On February 18, 1999, we changed our name to Fairhaven
	Technologies, Inc. (“Fairhaven”). Fairhaven’s business plan continued to involve the acquisition of certain
	medical technology. By June 1999, Fairhaven abandoned its business plan and had no operations until December 2001. On December
	14, 2001, we changed our name to Ideal Accents, Inc. Ideal Accents, Inc. was engaged primarily in the business of accessorizing
	cars and trucks at the new vehicle dealer level. Ideal Accents, Inc. ceased operations in 2005. IEC, our wholly owned subsidiary,
	commenced operations in 2010 and in February 2013, we changed our name to IEG Holdings Corporation.




	 




	In
	2005, Mr. Mathieson, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, founded IEG in Sydney, Australia. IEG
	launched the Amazing Loans business in Australia in 2005 and the Mr. Amazing Loans business in the United States via IEGC in 2010.
	From 2005 until 2012, Mr. Mathieson operated the Amazing Loans business through IEG in Australia. IEG ceased doing business in
	Australia in 2012. On January 28, 2013, IEGC entered into a stock exchange agreement (the “Stock Exchange Agreement”)
	among IEGC, its sole stockholder, IEG, and our company. Under the terms of the Stock Exchange Agreement, we agreed to acquire
	a 100% interest in IEGC for 272,447 shares of our common stock after giving effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split (also adjusted
	for the 1-for-100 reverse stock split that took effect June 17, 2015 and the net 1-for-10 reverse stock split that was effective
	on October 27, 2016). On February 14, 2013, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary
	of State of Florida which had the effect of:

	changing
	our name from Ideal Accents, Inc. to IEG Holdings Corporation,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	increasing
	the number of shares of our authorized common stock to 1,000,000,000, $0.001 par value,

	●




	effecting
	the Reverse Stock Split pursuant to the terms of the Stock Exchange Agreement.






	 




	FINRA
	approved the amendment to our articles of incorporation, as amended, on March 11, 2013.




	 




	On
	March 13, 2013, we completed the acquisition of IEGC under the terms of the Stock Exchange Agreement and issued to IEG 272,447
	shares of our common stock after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split whereby we acquired a 100% interest in IEGC. The stock
	exchange agreement between IEGC, IEG and IEG Holdings resulted in a reverse acquisition with a public shell, with IEGC being the
	accounting acquirer. IEG Holdings issued 90 shares of its common stock to the stockholders of IEG (IEG transferred its ownership
	in IEGC to its stockholders, which is why the shares were issued to the ultimate stockholders of IEG rather than to IEG itself)
	for each share of IEGC, in exchange for 100% ownership interest in IEGC. We determined that IEGC was the accounting acquirer because
	of the following facts and circumstances:




	 






	 




	1.




	After
	consummation of the transaction, the ultimate stockholders of IEGC own 99.1% of the outstanding shares of IEG Holdings;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	2.




	The
	board of directors of IEG Holdings immediately after the transaction is comprised exclusively of former directors of IEGC;
	and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	3.




	The
	operations of IEG Holdings immediately after the transaction are those of IEGC.






	 




	In
	August 2015, IEGC assigned all of its tangible and intangible assets to IEG Holdings and IEGC was dissolved.




	 




	On
	May 1, 2015, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary
	of State of Florida. The amendment was approved by FINRA, and became effective, on June 17, 2015. The articles of amendment effected
	(i) a 1-for-100 reverse stock split, and (ii) an increase in our authorized capital stock from 2,550,000,000 shares to 3,050,000,000
	shares, of which 3,000,000,000 shares are common stock and 50,000,000 are preferred stock.




	 




	On
	September 10, 2015, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the
	Secretary of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio
	of the Series H preferred stock, from 1,333/100,000 (0.01333) to 2,666/100,000 (0.02666) shares of common stock for each Series
	H preferred share, to account for the Company’s offering to existing stockholders of the Company commenced August 3, 2015.




	 




	On
	December 1, 2015, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary
	of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio of the Series
	H preferred stock, from 2,666/100,000 (0.02666) to 5,332/100,000 (0.05332) shares of common stock for each Series H preferred
	share, to account for the Company’s offering to existing stockholders of the Company commenced December 1, 2015.




	 




	On
	January 8, 2016, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary
	of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio of the Series
	H preferred stock, from 5,332/100,000 (0.05332) to 0.1 shares of common stock for each Series H preferred share, to account for
	the Company’s offering to existing stockholders of the Company commenced January 8, 2016.

	March 22, 2016, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended. The amendment
	had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock from 0.1 shares to 0.2 shares
	of common stock for each Series H preferred share, to account for our offering to existing stockholders commenced March 16, 2016.




	 




	Effective
	April 1, 2016, we amended our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, in order to effect a 1-for-100 reverse
	stock split. No fractional shares were issued. Rather, we paid stockholders who would have received a fractional share an amount
	equal to the average closing price per share of our common stock on the OTCQB, averaged over the period of 30 consecutive calendar
	days ending on (and including) April 1, 2016. In addition, after the reverse stock split was effected on April 1, 2016, we amended
	our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, to effect (i) a 100-for-1 forward stock split, and (ii) a reduction
	in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 3 billion to 200 million.

	On
	May 16, 2016, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary
	of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect, among other things, of:




	 






	 




	(i)




	Reducing
	the dividend rate on our Series H preferred stock from 10% per annum to 8% per annum,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(ii)




	Extending
	the date after which we may redeem the unconverted outstanding shares of Series H preferred stock from June 30, 2016 to December
	31, 2016,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(iii)




	Extending
	the date on which the holders of our Series H preferred stock may convert their shares into shares of our common stock from
	June 30, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(iv)




	Removing
	the requirement to adjust the Series H preferred stock conversion ratio when we conduct a rights offering to our existing
	stockholders.






	 




	On
	October 12, 2016, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary
	of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect of:




	 






	 




	(i)




	Adjusting
	the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock, from two to 0.2 shares of common stock for each Series H preferred share,
	to account for Company’s reverse/forward split effective October 27, 2016, and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(ii)




	Amending
	the redemption date of the Series H preferred stock from “[a]ny time after the December 31, 2016” to “[a]ny
	time after 6:00 p.m. Eastern time on December 31, 2016.”






	 




	Effective
	October 27, 2016, we effected a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock, at the ratio of 1-for-1,000. No
	fractional shares were issued. Rather, we paid stockholders who would have received a fractional share an amount equal to the
	average closing price per share of our common stock on the OTCQX, averaged over the period of 30 consecutive calendar days preceding
	the reverse stock split. Immediately following the completion of the reverse stock split, we effected a forward stock split of
	our common stock on a 100-for-1 share basis and a reduction of the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200,000,000
	to 40,000,000.




	 




	Effective
	December 5, 2016, we increased our number of authorized shares of common stock from 40,000,000 to 300,000,000.




	 




	On
	December 31, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Series H preferred stock, holders of an aggregate of 246,000 Series
	H preferred shares exercised their rights to convert their Series H preferred shares into 49,200 shares of our common stock. Also
	on December 31, 2016, following such conversions, the Company exercised its right to redeem all of the unconverted outstanding
	shares of Series H preferred stock. As a result, we redeemed an aggregate of 2,825,000 shares of Series H preferred stock for
	an aggregate amount of $2,825,000. Following the redemption of the unconverted shares of Series H preferred stock, no shares of
	Series H preferred stock were outstanding.

	are no family relationships between any of the executive officers and directors.




	 





	Director
	Qualifications





	 




	Mr.
	Mathieson was appointed to our board in March 2013 following the reverse merger with IEGC described in this prospectus. Given
	his role in the founding and/or operations of IEGC, we believe he remains a good fit for our current needs. Mr. Mathieson has
	significant operational experience in our industry and brings both a practical understanding of the industry and as well as hands-on
	experience in our business sector to our board and a greater understanding of certain of the challenges we face in executing our
	growth strategy.





	 






	Code
	of Ethics and Business Conduct





	 




	We
	have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to our board of directors, our executive officers and our employees.
	A copy of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our corporate website at

	www.investmentevolution.com

	,
	and any amendments to the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct or any waivers of its requirement related to certain matters, will
	be disclosed on our website and reported to the SEC, as may be required.





	 







	Director
	Compensation





	 




	During
	2016, each of our non-employee directors received an annual cash retainer of $36,000. We also reimbursed our non-employee
	directors for reasonable travel expenses incurred in attending board and committee meetings. We currently do not have any non-employee
	directors. Mr. Mathieson, our sole director, does not receive any compensation for his services as a director.

	following table summarizes all compensation recorded by us, including IEG Holdings, in the past two fiscal years for each of our

	In
	September 2015, Mr. Mathieson purchased 220,079 shares of common stock from us for an aggregate purchase price of $220,079.
	The full amount of the purchase price was offset by $220,079 of his $225,000 September 2015 discretionary bonus declared by
	the Board to him in September 2015 (for the period January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015) with the $4,921 balance offset against
	CEO advance. On December 31, 2015, Mr. Mathieson was paid $75,000 for his 2015 discretionary bonus declared by the Board to
	him (for the period October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015). The material factors considered by our board in awarding the total
	bonus to Mr. Mathieson were the substantial expansion in the loan book and the significant increase in revenues of the business
	in the relevant period.

	Mr.
	Mathieson serves as principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.

	IEGC entered into a professional consulting contract with Mr. Mathieson on September 30, 2014 with an effective
	date of January 1, 2014 (the “2014 Consulting Contract”), pursuant to which Mr. Mathieson agreed to provide regulatory

	August 2015, IEGC assigned all of its tangible and intangible assets to IEG Holdings and IEGC was dissolved.




	 




	On

	Limitation
	on Liability





	 




	The
	Florida Business Corporation Act permits the indemnification of directors, employees, officers and agents of Florida corporations.
	Our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and our amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify
	our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Florida Business Corporation Act.




	 







	 


	 

	38



	 







	 





	 




	The
	provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act that authorize indemnification do not eliminate the duty of care of a director,
	and in appropriate circumstances equitable remedies such as injunctive or other forms of non-monetary relief will remain available
	under Florida law. In addition, each director will continue to be subject to liability for:




	 






	 




	●




	violations
	of criminal laws, unless the director had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause to
	believe his conduct was unlawful,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	deriving
	an improper personal benefit from a transaction,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	voting
	for or assenting to an unlawful distribution, and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	willful
	misconduct or conscious disregard for our best interests in a proceeding by or in the right of a stockholder.






	 




	The
	statute does not affect a director’s responsibilities under any other law, such as the Federal securities laws. The effect
	of the foregoing is to require our company to indemnify our officers and directors for any claim arising against such persons
	in their official capacities if such person acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
	to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe
	his conduct was unlawful.




	 




	Insofar
	as the limitation of, or indemnification for, liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers,
	or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing, or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such
	limitation or indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.






	 










	CERTAIN
	RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS





	 




	We
	do not have a written policy for the review, approval or ratification of transactions with related parties or conflicted transactions.
	When such transactions arise, they are referred to our board of directors for its consideration.

	DESCRIPTION
	OF CAPITAL STOCK






	 





	The
	following description of our capital stock is based upon our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, our amended
	and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of law, in each case as currently in effect. This discussion does not purport to
	be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and
	our amended and restated bylaws, copies of which are filed with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement of which this
	prospectus is a part.




	 





	Authorized
	Capital Stock





	 




	As
	of the date of this prospectus, our authorized capital stock consists of (i) 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001
	per share, and (ii) 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. At January 12, 2017, we had 9,714,186
	shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of January 12, 2017, we had no shares of Series H preferred
	stock issued and outstanding. Effective June 17, 2015, the Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E preferred stock were cancelled.
	Effective January 1, 2016, the Series F and Series G preferred stock were entirely converted and/or redeemed. Effective March
	31, 2016, the Series A preferred stock was entirely converted. Effective May 16, 2016, the Series A, Series F and Series G preferred
	stock were cancelled. Effective December 31, 2016, all shares of Series H preferred stock were converted or redeemed.




	 





	Common
	Stock





	 




	The
	holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election
	of directors. There is no right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. The holders of common stock are entitled to any
	dividends that may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available for payment of dividends subject to the
	prior rights of holders of preferred stock and any contractual restrictions we have against the payment of dividends on common
	stock. In the event of our liquidation or dissolution, holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining
	after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of common stock
	have no preemptive rights and have no right to convert their common stock into any other securities.




	 





	Preferred
	Stock





	 




	The
	preferred stock is issuable in one or more series with such designations, voting powers, if any, preferences and relative, participating,
	optional or other special rights, and such qualifications, limitations and restrictions, as are determined by resolution of our
	board of directors. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control
	of our company without further action by stockholders and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights,
	of the holders of common stock.





	 







	Description
	of Series H Preferred Stock





	 




	Our
	amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, authorize 10,000,000 shares of Series H preferred stock, of which
	no shares are outstanding as of January 12, 2017. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to our Series
	H preferred stock.




	 





	Ranking.

	The Series H preferred stock ranks

	pari passu

	with any other series of preferred stock subsequently designated by IEG
	Holdings and not designated as senior securities or subordinate to the Series H preferred stock.




	 





	Liquidation
	Preference.

	In the event of a liquidation or winding up of IEG Holdings, a holder of Series H preferred stock will be entitled
	to receive $1.00 per share of Series H preferred stock.




	 





	Dividends.

	The Series H preferred stock is entitled to receive 8% per annum dividends, paid quarterly.




	 





	Conversion.

	Holders of Series H preferred shares have the following rights with respect to the conversion of Series H preferred shares
	into shares of our common stock:




	 






	 




	●




	On
	December 31, 2016 and upon notice provided by the holder to us, a holder has the right to convert, at face value per share,
	all or any portion of their Series H preferred shares into shares of our common stock on the basis of 0.2 shares of common
	stock for each share of Series H preferred stock so converted (the “Series H Conversion Ratio”). Effective December
	31, 2015, holders of an aggregate of 160,000 shares of Series H preferred stock notified the Company of their intent to convert
	their Series H shares into shares of common stock. On December 31, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of 8,531 shares of
	common stock to such Series H holders.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	If
	at any time after the date of issuance of the Series H preferred stock, in the event IEG Holdings (i) makes or issues a dividend
	or other distribution payable in common stock (other than with respect to the Series H preferred stock); (ii) subdivides outstanding
	shares of common stock into a larger number of shares; or (iii) combines outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller
	number of shares, the Series H Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately.






	 







	 


	 

	42



	 







	 





	 






	 




	●




	Except
	as otherwise provided in the amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, if the common stock issuable upon
	the conversion of the Series H preferred stock shall be changed into the same or different number of shares of any class or
	classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise, then in each such event, the holder of
	each share of Series H preferred stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares
	of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such capital reorganization, reclassification or other change by
	holders of the number of shares of common stock into which such shares of Series H preferred stock might have been converted
	immediately prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification or other change.






	 





	Voting.

	On all matters to come before our stockholders, holders of Series H preferred stock have that number of votes per share (rounded
	to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of: (a) the number of shares of Series H preferred stock held on the record date
	for the determination of the holders of the shares entitled to vote, or, if no record date is established, at the date such vote
	is taken or any written consent of stockholders is first solicited, and (b) 13/100. The holders of Series H preferred shares vote
	together with the holders of the outstanding shares of all other capital stock of IEG Holdings (including and any other series
	of preferred stock then outstanding), and not as a separate class, series or voting group.




	 





	Redemption
	and Call Rights.

	Any time after 6:00 p.m. Eastern time on December 31, 2016, we have the right, but not the obligation, to
	redeem all of the unconverted outstanding shares of Series H preferred stock by paying in cash an amount per share equal to $1.00.




	 





	Anti-Takeover
	Effects of Certain Provisions of Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as Amended, and Our Amended and Restated
	Bylaws





	 




	Provisions
	of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and our amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult
	to acquire us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest, open market purchases, removal of incumbent directors and otherwise.
	These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover
	bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased
	protection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure
	us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging takeover or acquisition proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result
	in an improvement of their terms.




	 





	Calling
	of Special Meetings of Stockholders.

	Our amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may
	be called only by the board of directors or by the president, and shall be called by the president or the secretary at the request
	in writing of record stockholders owning at least 10% of shares outstanding and entitled to vote.




	 





	Removal
	of Directors; Vacancies.

	Our amended and restated bylaws provide that a director may be removed from office with or without
	cause, at any time, by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote for
	the election of directors, at a special meeting of the stockholders called and held for that purpose. A vacancy on the board of
	directors may be filled only by stockholders at such meeting, or if the stockholders fail to fill such vacancy, by a majority
	of the directors then in office.




	 





	Amendment
	of Bylaws.

	Our amended and restated bylaws provide that our board of directors may amend or repeal the amended and restated
	bylaws, or new bylaws may be adopted by the board of directors, at any time without stockholder approval. Allowing the board to
	amend our amended and restated bylaws without stockholder approval enhances board control over our bylaws.




	 





	Preferred
	Stock.

	Our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of
	preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors in their sole
	discretion. Our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue series of preferred stock with dividends, liquidation,
	conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.

	●




	the

	Information
	on beneficial ownership of securities is based upon a record list of our shareholders and we have determined beneficial ownership

	in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own,
	subject to applicable community property laws. Based on the information provided to us by or on behalf of the selling stockholders,
	no selling stockholder, and no entity listed in the footnotes to the table below, is a broker-dealer or an affiliate of a broker-dealer.




	 




	The
	selling security holders may sell some or all of the securities owned by them, and there are currently no agreements, arrangements
	or understandings with respect to the sale of any of the securities. The table below assumes that the selling stockholders sell
	all of the shares offered for sale. The business address of each person listed is in care of IEG Holdings Corporation, 6160 West
	Tropicana Ave, Suite E-13, Las Vegas, NV 89103.

	DISCLOSURE
	OF COMMISSION’S POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES





	 




	Our
	directors and officers are indemnified as provided by Florida law, our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended,
	and our amended and restated bylaws. We have agreed to indemnify each of our directors and certain officers against certain liabilities,
	including liabilities under the Securities Act. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may
	be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions described above, or otherwise, we have
	been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
	and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than our payment
	of expenses incurred or paid by our director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
	is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless
	in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
	the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed
	by the final adjudication of such issue.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 




	To
	the Board of Directors and Shareholders of IEG Holdings Corporation:




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IEG Holdings Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015
	and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then
	ended. IEG Holdings Corporation’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.




	 




	We
	conducted our audit in accordance with the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
	statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
	basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
	that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
	financial position of IEG Holdings Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results
	of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and negative
	cash flows from operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
	concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements
	do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	DECEMBER
	31, 2015 AND 2014




	 




	1.
	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 





	Nature
	of Business





	 




	The
	principal business activity of the Company is providing unsecured $5,000 consumer loans over a five-year term through its subsidiaries
	Investment Evolution Corporation and IEC SPV, LLC. The loans are offered under the consumer brand “Mr. Amazing Loans”.
	The Company is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada and originates consumer loans in the states of Alabama, Arizona, California,
	Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah,
	and Virginia via its online platform and distribution network. The Company is a licensed direct lender with state licenses and/or
	certificates of authority to lend in these 17 states and offers all loans within the prevailing statutory rates.




	 





	Basis
	of Accounting





	 




	These
	consolidated financial statements include the operations of IEG Holdings Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Investment
	Evolution Corporation and IEC SPV, LLC (collectively, the “Company”). All inter-company transactions and balances
	have been eliminated in consolidation.




	 




	In
	August 2015, the Company dissolved redundant subsidiary companies Investment Evolution Philippines Corporation, Investment Evolution
	Global Corporation and Investment Evolution Canada, LLC, as it no longer has plans to pursue international expansion.




	 




	The
	Company’s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform
	to general practices within the consumer finance industry.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has reported recurring losses
	and has not generated positive net cash flows from operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
	ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is increasing its revenue and management intends to seek additional capital
	sufficient to continue operations. If the Company is not successful in raising sufficient capital, it may have to delay or reduce
	expenses, or curtail operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
	the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
	that could result should the Company not continue as a going concern.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Management
	uses its historical records and knowledge of its business in making these estimates. Accordingly, actual results may differ from
	these estimates.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	For
	the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers cash equivalents to include short-term, highly liquid investments
	with an original maturity of three months or less.




	 





	Loans
	Receivable and Interest Income





	 




	The
	Company is licensed to originate consumer loans in the states of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
	Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. During fiscal 2015, the
	Company originated $5,000 and $10,000 loans over a five-year term and during fiscal 2014, the Company originated $2,000, $3,000,
	$5,000 and $10,000 loans with terms ranging from three to five years. In June 2015, the Company streamlined its product offering
	to $5,000 loans over a five-year term. The Company offers its loans at or below the prevailing statutory rates. Loans are carried
	at the unpaid principal amount outstanding, net of an allowance for credit losses.

	DECEMBER

	The
	Company calculates interest revenue using the interest yield method. Charges for late payments are credited to income when collected.




	 




	Accrual
	of interest income on loans receivable is suspended when no payment has been received on account for 91 days or more on a contractual
	basis, at which time a loan is considered delinquent. Payments received on nonaccrual financing loans are first applied to the
	unpaid accrued interest and then principal. Loans are returned to active status and accrual of interest income is resumed when
	all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current; at which time management believes future payments
	are reasonably assured. At December 31, 2015, 111 loans with a total balance of $543,054 were delinquent or in default.




	 





	Allowance
	for Credit Losses





	 




	The
	Company maintains an allowance for credit losses due to the fact that it is probable that a portion of the loans receivable will
	not be collected. The allowance is estimated by management based on various factors, including specific circumstances of the individual
	loans, management’s knowledge of the industry, and the experience and trends of other companies in the same industry.




	 




	Our
	portfolio of loans receivable consists of a large number of relatively small, homogenous accounts. The allowance for credit losses
	is determined using a systematic methodology, based on a combination of historical bad debt of comparable companies. Impaired
	loans are considered separately and 100% charged off.




	 




	The
	allowance for credit losses is primarily based upon models that analyze specific portfolio statistics and also reflect, management’s
	judgment regarding overall accuracy. We take into account several factors, including the customer’s transaction history,
	specifically the timeliness of customer payments, the remaining contractual term of the loan, and the outstanding balance of the
	loan.




	 





	Impaired
	Loans





	 




	The
	Company assesses loans for impairment individually when a loan is 91 days past due. The Company defines impaired loans as bankrupt
	accounts and accounts that are 184 days or more past due. In accordance with the Company’s charge-off policy, once a loan
	is deemed uncollectible, 100% of the remaining balance is charged-off. Loans can also be charged off when deemed uncollectable
	due to consumer specific circumstances.




	 




	The
	Company does not accrue interest on impaired loans and any recoveries of impaired loans are recorded to the allowance for credit
	losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying statement of operations.




	 







	Property
	and Equipment





	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are being provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
	useful lives of the assets as follows:




	 






	Classification




	 




	Life






	Computer
	equipment




	 




	3-5
	years






	Furniture
	and fixtures




	 




	8
	years







	 




	The
	Company amortizes its leasehold improvements over the shorter of their economic lives, which are generally five years, or the
	lease term that considers renewal periods that are reasonably assured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
	as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated
	depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.




	 





	Operating
	Leases





	 




	The
	Company’s office leases all expire (unless renewed) during 2016.




	 





	Loan
	Costs





	 




	Loan
	costs consisted of broker success fees and legal fees related to the credit facility. These costs were amortized over the period
	of the credit facility. Accumulated amortization of loan costs amounted to $205,485 and 127,704 at December 31, 2015 and 2014,
	respectively. The loan costs were fully amortized at December 31, 2015 as the credit facility was repaid in full on August 21,
	2015.

	Income
	Taxes





	 




	We
	account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	740 “Income Taxes”. To date, no current income tax liability has been recorded due to our accumulated net losses.
	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
	of assets and liabilities and the amounts that are reported in the income tax returns. Our net deferred income tax assets have
	been fully reserved by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income and to recover
	our net deferred income tax assets.




	 





	Advertising
	Costs





	 




	Advertising
	costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $950,905 and $459,804 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.




	 





	Earnings
	and Loss per Share





	 




	The
	Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10 that establishes standards for computing and presenting
	net earnings (loss) per shares. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) attributed to common
	shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed
	similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares
	that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares, if any, had been issued and if the additional common shares were
	dilutive. Basic and diluted loss per share has been adjusted retroactively for the 1-for-100 reverse split that occurred on June
	17, 2015 and the net 1-for-10 reverse split that occurred on October 27, 2016.




	 





	Reclassifications





	 




	Certain
	numbers from the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.




	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	The
	Company has adopted guidance issued by the FASB that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance
	with existing generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Assets and liabilities
	recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the
	inputs used to measure their fair value. The categories are as follows:




	 








	 




	Level
	I




	Inputs
	are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	Level
	II




	Inputs,
	other than quoted prices included in Level I, that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market
	data at the measurement date.







	 




	 




	 






	 




	Level
	III




	Unobservable
	inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
	at the measurement date.






	 




	At
	December 31, 2015 and 2014, the only financial instruments that are subject to these classifications are cash and cash equivalents,
	which are considered Level I assets.




	 




	Carrying
	amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for other receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate
	fair value because of their immediate or short-term nature. The fair value of borrowings is not considered to be significantly
	different than its carrying amount because the stated rates for such debt reflect current market rates and conditions.

	SENIOR DEBT




	 




	The
	Company had a credit facility that provided for borrowings of up to $10 million with $0 and $2,230,000 outstanding at December
	31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, subject to a borrowing base formula. The Company could borrow, at its option, at
	the rate of 18% with a minimum advance of $25,000. Proceeds from this credit facility were used to fund loans to consumers. In
	July 2015, the credit facility was converted to a term loan, to be repaid monthly, with payments equal to 100% of the consumer
	loan proceeds, with the balance due June 1, 2016. The credit facility was repaid in full on August 21, 2015.




	 




	The
	credit facility remains subject to a net profit interest under which the Company will pay BFG Loan Holdings, LLC, 20% of its subsidiary
	IEC SPV, LLC’s “Net Profit” until 10 years from the date the loan is repaid in full. Net Profit is defined as
	the gross revenue less (i) interest paid on the loan, (ii) payments on any other debt incurred as a result of an approved Refinance
	Event, (iii) any costs, fees or commissions paid on the existing credit facility, and (iv) charge-offs to bad debt resulting from
	consumer loans. If the Refinance event shall be approved by BFG Loan Holdings, LLC and occur as set forth in the agreement, the
	net profit percentage shall be reduced to 10%. The Net Profit arrangement can be terminated by the Company upon a payment of $3,000,000.
	Net profit interest for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $107,340 and $0, respectively. All loans receivable of
	the company are pledged as collateral at December 31, 2015 for the fulfillment of the Net Profit calculation.

	TAXES






	 




	The
	difference between income tax expense attributable to continuing operations and the amount of income tax expense that would result
	from applying domestic federal statutory rates to pre-tax income (loss) is mainly related to an increase in the valuation allowance.
	Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
	Deferred income tax assets are mainly related to net operating loss carryforwards.

	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	DECEMBER
	31, 2015 AND 2014




	 




	Management
	has chosen to take a 100% valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset until such time as management believes that
	its projections of future profits make the realization of the deferred income tax assets more likely than not. Significant judgment
	is required in the evaluation of deferred income tax benefits and differences in future results from management’s estimates
	could result in material differences.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2015, the Company has a net loss carryforward of approximately $16 million that may potentially be used to offset
	future Federal taxable income. This net loss carryforward will expire through 2035. In the event of statutory ownership changes,
	the amount of net operating loss carryforward that may be utilized in future years is subject to significant limitations.




	 




	The
	Company has adopted guidance issued by the FASB that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
	enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement process
	for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In making
	this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination,
	based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by taxing authorities.
	The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Interest
	and penalties totaled $0 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The Company files income tax returns with the Internal
	Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the states of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,
	Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia. All of the Company’s tax filings
	are still subject to examination. The Company’s net operating loss carryforwards are subject to IRS examination until they
	are fully utilized and such tax years are closed.




	 




	We
	utilize FASB ASC 740-10, “Income Taxes” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
	the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.




	 




	Under
	this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases
	of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates
	applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established,
	when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The provision for income taxes represents
	the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

	The
	Company’s portfolio of finance receivables is with consumers living throughout Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia,
	Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Virginia and consequently

	COMMITMENTS
	AND CONTINGENCIES






	 





	Operating
	Leases





	 




	The
	Company leases its operating facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire through September 2016. Total rent expense
	for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $244,621 and $250,744, respectively. The Company is responsible for certain
	operating expenses in connection with these leases. The future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating
	leases as of December 31, 2015 is $125,192 to be paid within the next twelve months.




	 




	The
	Company subleased the Chicago office in September 2014 and is currently looking to sublease the remaining two unused offices which
	could reduce future required rental payments.




	 





	Legal
	Matters





	 




	From
	time to time, the Company may be involved in legal proceedings in the normal course of its business. The Company is not involved
	in any legal proceedings at the present time.




	 





	Professional
	Consulting Contract





	 




	The
	Company has a professional consulting contract with its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), according to which, the Company
	paid $1 million and health insurance plus a bonus of $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 ($220,079 of the bonus was
	offset against common stock subscription and $4,921 offset against CEO advance). The Company is obligated to pay its CEO $1,000,000
	annually plus health insurance, with a discretionary bonus to be determined by the IEG Holdings Corporation Board on December
	31, 2015. The Board amended the contract as of September 30, 2015 and elected to pay $225,000 of the yearly discretionary bonus
	on September 30, 2015. In addition, the IEG Holdings’ board of directors authorized a final portion in the amount of $75,000
	of the 2015 bonus to be paid to Mr. Mathieson on December 31, 2015 for services previously rendered by Mr. Mathieson from October
	1, 2015 to December 31, 2015.




	 





	Regulatory
	Requirements





	 




	State
	statutes authorizing the Company’s products and services typically provide state agencies that regulate banks and financial
	institutions with significant regulatory powers to administer and enforce the law. Under statutory authority, state regulators
	have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements
	in different ways, or issue new administrative rules. In addition, when the staff of state regulatory bodies change, it is possible
	that the interpretations of applicable laws and regulations may also change.

	SUBSEQUENT
	EVENTS






	 




	On
	January 1, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Series G preferred stock, the Company exercised its right to redeem
	all of the unconverted outstanding shares of Series G preferred. On December 24, 2015, the Company early paid the holders of the
	160,000 unconverted shares of Series G preferred stock an aggregate of $160,000. Following the redemption of the unconverted shares
	of Series G preferred stock, no shares of Series G preferred stock were outstanding.




	 




	On
	January 8, 2016, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary
	of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect of adjusting the conversion ratios of the Series A and Series H
	preferred stock to account for the Company’s offering to existing stockholders of the Company commenced January 8, 2016:




	 






	 




	(i)




	Adjusting
	the conversion ratio of the Series A preferred stock from 1.6 to 3.2 shares of common stock for each Series A preferred stock;
	and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(ii)




	Adjusting
	the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock from 5,332/100,000 (0.05332) to one share of common stock for each Series
	H preferred stock.






	 




	On
	January 14, 2016, we filed a Preliminary Schedule 14C Information Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in connection
	with the approval of articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, by our Board of
	Directors and the holder of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company, to, on
	the Effective Date (as defined below), (i) effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock,
	at the ratio of 1-for-100, (ii) immediately after the reverse stock split, effect a forward stock split on a 100-for-1 share basis
	of the issued and outstanding common stock and reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock from 3,000,000,000 to 200,000,000,
	and (iii) immediately prior to the reverse stock split, pay in cash to those shareholders holding fewer than 100 shares of common
	stock, instead of issuing fractional shares, an amount per share equal to the average closing price per share of the common stock
	on the OTCQB, averaged over a period of 30 consecutive calendar days ending on (and including) the date of the Effective Date,
	without interest. The articles of amendment will be effective upon their filing with the Secretary of State of Florida which will
	occur approximately, but not less than, 20 days after the definitive information statement is mailed to the shareholders of the
	Company (“Effective Date”).




	 




	On
	January 22, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 370 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $50.00 per share
	to certain of its existing stockholders for receipt of an aggregate of $18,500. These securities were issued in reliance upon
	the exemptions provided by Regulation S promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act. The issuances involved offers and sales of
	securities outside the United States. The offers and sales were made in offshore transactions and no directed selling efforts
	were made by the issuer, a distributor, their affiliates or any persons acting on their behalf.




	 




	On
	January 25, 2016, the Company filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement to offer to the public up to 100,000 common shares at $50.00
	per share.

	 SUBSEQUENT EVENT – RESTATEMENT FOR THE REVERSE/FORWARD STOCK SPLIT




	 




	On
	October 27, 2016, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock, at the ratio of 1-for-1,000
	(the “Reverse Split”). Also on October 27, 2016, immediately following the completion of the Reverse Split, the Company
	effected a forward stock split on a 100-for-1 share basis. On the same date, the Company also reduced the number of authorized
	shares of common stock from 200,000,000 to 40,000,000. The financial statements at December 31, 2015 and 2014 have been retroactively
	restated to reflect this split.

	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	SEPTEMBER
	30, 2016




	 




	1.
	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	General




	 




	The
	quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 should be read in conjunction with the Company’s
	financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 18,
	2016. As contemplated by the SEC under Article 8 of Regulation S-X, the accompanying financial statements and footnotes have been
	condensed and therefore do not contain all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. The interim financial
	data are unaudited, however in the opinion of IEG Holdings Corporation (“we, “our”, “us”) the interim
	data includes all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of results for
	the interim periods. Results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those to be expected for the full year.




	 




	Nature
	of Business




	 




	The
	principal business activity of the Company is providing unsecured $5,000 and $10,000 consumer loans over a five-year term through
	its subsidiaries Investment Evolution Corporation and IEC SPV, LLC. The loans are offered under the consumer brand “Mr.
	Amazing Loans”. The Company is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada and originates consumer loans in the states of Alabama,
	Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
	Texas, Utah, and Virginia via its online platform and distribution network. The Company is a licensed direct lender with state
	licenses and/or certificates of authority to lend in these 17 states and offers all loans within the prevailing statutory rates.




	 




	Basis
	of Accounting




	 




	These
	consolidated financial statements include the operations of IEG Holdings Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Investment
	Evolution Corporation and IEC SPV, LLC (collectively, the “Company”). All inter-company transactions and balances
	have been eliminated in consolidation.




	 




	The
	Company’s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform
	to general practices within the consumer finance industry.




	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect any possible future
	effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities.




	 




	Liquidity




	 




	The
	principal conditions/events that raise substantial doubt of the company’s ability to meet its obligations are i) the Company
	has reported recurring losses and ii) the Company has not yet generated positive net cash flows from operations. However, the
	Company has increased its revenue, management’s plans for the next 12 months alleviate the substantial doubt and management
	evaluates that as a result of these plans the Company can meet all its obligations through October 2017. Without raising additional
	debt or equity capital, management’s plans include reducing advertising costs to significantly reduce loan originations
	and related loan processing costs. There would also be a significant reduction in consulting and professional fees without additional
	capital being raised. Management’s plans also include utilizing the funds received from loan principal repayments for operating
	expenses rather than investing in loan origination. In addition, significant core operating costs have been cut from the Company
	in 2016 including reducing the number of employees from 12 to 7 due to increased automation of loan origination processes and
	reducing the number of office leases from 4 to 1 in the past quarter as old leases expired. While the Company has sufficient cash
	on hand at September 30, 2016 combined with anticipated cash flow from loan repayments to continue operations for at least 12
	months, the Company intends, over the next 12 months, to seek additional capital via unsecured notes to expand operations and
	the Company has shown the capacity to raise substantial equity capital over the past few years and, although not the current plan,
	could seek additional equity capital if required.

	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	SEPTEMBER

	Use
	of Estimates




	 




	The
	preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Management
	uses its historical records and knowledge of its business in making these estimates. Accordingly, actual results may differ from
	these estimates.




	 




	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents




	 




	For
	the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers cash equivalents to include short-term, highly liquid investments
	with an original maturity of three months or less.




	 




	Loans
	Receivable and Interest Income




	 




	The
	Company is licensed to originate consumer loans in the states of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
	Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. During the nine months ended
	September 30 2016 and 2015, the Company originated $5,000 and $10,000 loans over a five year term. The Company offers its loans
	at or below the prevailing statutory rates. Loans are carried at the unpaid principal amount outstanding, net of an allowance
	for credit losses.




	 




	The
	Company calculates interest revenue using the interest yield method. Charges for late payments are credited to income when collected.




	 




	Accrual
	of interest income on loans receivable is suspended when no payment has been received on account for 91 days or more on a contractual
	basis, at which time a loan is considered delinquent. Payments received on nonaccrual financing loans are first applied to the
	unpaid accrued interest and then principal. Loans are returned to active status and accrual of interest income is resumed when
	all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current; at which time management believes future payments
	are reasonably assured. At September 30, 2016, 97 loans with a total balance of $433,781 were delinquent or in default.




	 




	Allowance
	for Credit Losses




	 




	The
	Company maintains an allowance for credit losses due to the fact that it is probable that a portion of the loans receivable will
	not be collected. The allowance is estimated by management based on various factors, including specific circumstances of the individual
	loans, management’s knowledge of the industry, and the experience and trends of other companies in the same industry.




	 




	Our
	portfolio of loans receivable consists of a large number of relatively small, homogenous accounts. The allowance for credit losses
	is determined using a systematic methodology, based on a combination of historical bad debt of comparable companies. Impaired
	loans are considered separately and 100% charged off.




	 




	The
	allowance for credit losses is primarily based upon models that analyze specific portfolio statistics and also reflect, management’s
	judgment regarding overall accuracy. We take into account several factors, including the customer’s transaction history,
	specifically the timeliness of customer payments, the remaining contractual term of the loan, and the outstanding balance of the
	loan.




	 




	Impaired
	Loans




	 




	The
	Company assesses loans for impairment individually when a loan is 91 days past due. The Company defines impaired loans as bankrupt
	accounts and accounts that are 184 days or more past due. In accordance with the Company’s charge-off policy, once a loan
	is deemed uncollectible, 100% of the remaining balance is charged-off. Loans can also be charged off when deemed uncollectable
	due to consumer specific circumstances.




	 




	The
	Company does not accrue interest on impaired loans and any recoveries of impaired loans are recorded to the allowance for credit
	losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying statement of operations.

	Property
	and Equipment




	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are being provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
	useful lives of the assets as follows:




	 






	Classification




	 




	 




	Life




	 






	Computer equipment




	 




	 




	5
	years




	 






	Furniture and fixtures




	 




	 




	5-8
	years




	 







	 




	The
	Company amortizes its leasehold improvements over the shorter of their economic lives, which are generally five years, or the
	lease term that considers renewal periods that are reasonably assured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
	as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated
	depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.




	 




	Operating
	Lease




	 




	The
	Company’s office lease in Las Vegas expires (unless renewed) on September 30, 2017.




	 




	Income
	Taxes




	 




	We
	account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	740 “Income Taxes”. To date, no current income tax liability has been recorded due to our accumulated net losses.
	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
	of assets and liabilities and the amounts that are reported in the income tax returns. Our net deferred income tax assets have
	been fully reserved by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income and to recover
	our net deferred income tax assets.




	 




	Advertising
	Costs




	 




	Advertising
	costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $313,902 and $527,452 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
	and 2015, respectively. Advertising costs amounted to $92,593 and $211,828 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
	respectively.




	 




	Earnings
	and Loss per Share




	 




	The
	Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10 that establishes standards for computing and presenting
	net earnings (loss) per shares. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) attributed to common
	shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed
	similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares
	that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares, if any, had been issued and if the additional common shares were
	dilutive. Basic and diluted loss per share has been adjusted retroactively for the 1-for-100 reverse split that occurred on June
	17, 2015 and for the net 1-for-10 reverse split that occurred on October 27, 2016.




	 




	Reclassifications




	 




	Certain
	numbers from the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.




	 




	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments




	 




	The
	Company has adopted guidance issued by the FASB that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance
	with existing generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Assets and liabilities
	recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the
	inputs used to measure their fair value. The categories are as follows:




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	I – Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	II – Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level I that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration
	with market data at the measurement date.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	III – Unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing
	the asset or liability at the measurement date.

	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	SEPTEMBER
	30, 2016




	 




	At
	September 30, 2016 and 2015, the only financial instruments that are subject to these classifications are cash and cash equivalents,
	which are considered Level I assets.




	 




	Carrying
	amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for other receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate
	fair value because of their immediate or short-term nature. The fair value of borrowings is not considered to be significantly
	different than its carrying amount because the stated rates for such debt reflect current market rates and conditions.

	Depreciation of property and equipment amounted to $3,212 and $4,192 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
	respectively. Depreciation costs are included in the accompanying statements of operations in operating expenses.




	 




	4.
	SENIOR DEBT




	 




	The
	Company had a credit facility that provided for borrowings of up to $10 million with $0 and $0 outstanding at September 30, 2016
	and December 31, 2015, respectively, subject to a borrowing base formula. The Company could borrow, at its option, at the rate
	of 18% with a minimum advance of $25,000. Proceeds from this credit facility were used to fund loans to consumers. In July 2015,
	the credit facility was converted to a term loan, to be repaid monthly, with payments equal to 100% of the consumer loan proceeds,
	with the balance due June 1, 2016. The credit facility was repaid in full on August 21, 2015.




	 




	The
	credit facility remains subject to a net profit interest under which the Company will pay BFG Loan Holdings, LLC, 20% of its subsidiary
	IEC SPV, LLC’s “Net Profit” until 10 years from the date the loan is repaid in full (August 2015). Net Profit
	is defined as the gross revenue less (i) interest paid on the loan, (ii) payments on any other debt incurred as a result of an
	approved Refinance Event, (iii) any costs, fees or commissions paid on the existing credit facility, and (iv) charge-offs to bad
	debt resulting from consumer loans and reduced by servicing fee. If the Refinance event shall be approved by BFG Loan Holdings,
	LLC and occur as set forth in the agreement, the net profit percentage shall be reduced to 10%. The Net Profit arrangement can
	be terminated by the Company upon a payment of $3,000,000. Net profit interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
	2015 were $96,083 and $69,297, respectively. All loans receivable of the Company were pledged as collateral at September 30, 2016
	for the fulfillment of the Net Profit calculation. As of September 30, 2016, $58,885 has been paid and $37,198 was fully accrued
	for.




	 




	5.
	STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY




	 




	On
	January 1, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Series G preferred stock, the Company exercised its right to redeem
	all of the unconverted outstanding shares of Series G preferred stock. On December 24, 2015, the Company early paid the holders
	of the 160,000 unconverted shares of Series G preferred stock an aggregate of $160,000. Following the redemption of the unconverted
	shares of Series G preferred stock, no shares of Series G preferred stock were outstanding.




	 




	On
	January 22, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 370 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $50.00 per share
	to a total of two existing stockholders, each of whom resided in Australia, for receipt of an aggregate of $18,500. These securities
	were issued in reliance upon the exemptions provided by Regulation S promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act. The issuances
	involved offers and sales of securities outside the United States. The offers and sales were made in offshore transactions and
	no directed selling efforts were made by the issuer, a distributor, their affiliates or any persons acting on their behalf. An
	offering circular was used in connection with this offering.




	 




	On

	Item
	14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers





	 




	The
	Florida Business Corporation Act allows us to indemnify any person made a party to any lawsuit by reason of being a director or
	officer of the Company, or serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
	partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and
	amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted
	in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
	respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.




	 




	Our
	amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, provide that our directors and officers shall be indemnified and the
	Company shall advance expenses on behalf of its officers and directors to the fullest extent not prohibited by law either now
	or hereafter.




	 




	Our
	amended and restated bylaws require us to indemnify directors and officers against, to the fullest extent permitted by law, liabilities
	which they may incur under the circumstances described above.




	 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
	of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.





	 







	Item
	15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

	 




	 






	The
	following is a summary of transactions by us within the past three years involving sales or our securities that were not registered

	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
	of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
	SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the
	event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
	or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
	is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant
	will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
	jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will
	be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.




	 






	(a)




	Rule
	415 Offering. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:

	(ii)




	To
	reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most
	recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information
	set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered
	(if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low
	or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant
	to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate
	offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(iii)




	To
	include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement
	or any material change to such information in the registration statement;






	 






	(2)




	That,
	for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be
	deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities
	at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.






	 




	 






	(3)




	To
	remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold
	at the termination of the offering.

	Re:
	IEG Holdings Corporation Amendment Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-215239 )




	 




	Gentlemen:




	 




	We
	have acted as counsel for IEG Holdings Corporation, a Florida corporation (the “Company”), in connection with the
	registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) of 9,038,520 shares of common stock (the “Registered
	Shares”) offered for resale by certain selling stockholders (the “Selling Stockholders”) named in the Company’s
	registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-215239 ) (the “Registration Statement”), filed by the Company
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission.




	 




	We
	have examined originals or certified copies of such corporate records of the Company and other certificates and documents of officials
	of the Company, public officials and others as we have deemed appropriate for purposes of this letter. We have assumed the genuineness
	of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to authentic original documents
	of all copies submitted to us as conformed and certified or reproduced copies.




	 




	Subject
	to and in reliance upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Registered Shares have been validly authorized and are validly
	issued, fully paid and non-assessable.




	 




	We
	express no opinion with regard to the applicability or effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than, as in effect on the date
	of this letter, (a) the internal laws of the State of Florida; and (b) the federal laws of the United States.




	 




	We
	hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Amendment and to the reference to our firm under the caption
	“Legal Matters” in the Amendment. In so doing, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent
	is required under Section 7 of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder.

LendingClub brushes off unsolicited offer from IEG for stake
Online lender LendingClub Corp.  said Friday it received a letter last week from consumer-lending company IEG Holdings Corp.  stating IEG's intention to buy up to 9.99% of the LendingClub's shares on the basis of two shares of IEG stock for each share of LendingClub stock, a 38% discount to the current price of LendingClub's stock. There's no "rational economic basis" for LendingClub stockholders to accept the exchange offer, which "appears intended to mislead investors into mistakenly tendering into a deeply discounted offer," LendingClub said in a statement. The offer is "grossly inadequate," and LendingClub urged stockholders "not to be misled into tendering into the offer, if and when it is made," it said. Shares of LendingClub were recently down 0.6% after ending the regular session up 1.1%.

LendingClub brushes off unsolicited offer from IEG for stake
Online lender LendingClub Corp.  said Friday it received a letter last week from consumer-lending company IEG Holdings Corp.  stating IEG's intention to buy up to 9.99% of the LendingClub's shares on the basis of two shares of IEG stock for each share of LendingClub stock, a 38% discount to the current price of LendingClub's stock. There's no "rational economic basis" for LendingClub stockholders to accept the exchange offer, which "appears intended to mislead investors into mistakenly tendering into a deeply discounted offer," LendingClub said in a statement. The offer is "grossly inadequate," and LendingClub urged stockholders "not to be misled into tendering into the offer, if and when it is made," it said. Shares of LendingClub were recently down 0.6% after ending the regular session up 1.1%.
