Early life[edit]
Joe Kiani was born in Shiraz, Iran, and emigrated to the United States at the age of nine.[1] Kiani's father was an engineer and his mother was a nurse.[2] Despite not speaking more than three words in English when he arrived in the United States, he graduated from high school at the age of 15 and, by the time he was 22, had earned both his bachelor's (B.S.E.E) and master's (M.S.E.E) degrees in electrical engineering from San Diego State University.[3] In 2005, Kiani was awarded the Monty Distinguished Alumni Award by San Diego State University.[4]
Career at Masimo[edit]
Kiani founded the medical technology company Masimo in 1989 and was later joined by partner Mohammed Diab.[5] The company is now publicly traded and employs more than 3,000 people worldwide.[6] Masimo technologies are used to monitor over 100 million patients per year.[7] According to industry watchers, "...while that accomplishment alone puts him in the same breath as business legends like Apple's Steve Jobs or Microsoft's Bill Gates, Kiani's contribution to the world of medicine may be even more profound."[8] In 2011, Forbes named Masimo to its list of top 20 public companies under a billion dollars in revenue, based on earnings growth, sales growth, and return on equity.[9][10]
Pulse oximetry is one of the most common monitoring technologies used in healthcare. Masimo makes a pulse oximetry technology known as Signal Extraction Technology (SET), which is known as being the first pulse oximemtry technology to reliably measure-through motion and low perfusion conditions.[11] Masimo's additional industry-first technologies include rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry, which noninvasively and continuously measures blood constituents and physiological parameters that previously required invasive procedures, such as total hemoglobin (SpHb), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO), methemoglobin (SpMet), and pleth variability index (PVI).[12] Masimo also makes rainbow Acoustic Monitoring, which measures respiration rate (RRa),[13] and recently debuted Halo Index in their SafetyNet system, combining multiple physiologic parameters into one number to help clinicians assess overall patient status.[14]
Kiani and Masimo have over 575 issued and pending patents worldwide.[15] Under Kiani's leadership, Masimo won a patent infringement award of more than $300 million in damages when it settled a lawsuit against the Nellcor division of Tyco Healthcare (now known as Covidien) for infringing on its patents for measure-through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry in 2006.[16] Kiani and Masimo also won a 2004 lawsuit against Tyco for violating antitrust laws specifically related to the sale of its Nellcor pulse oximetry products and was ultimately awarded $43.5 million.[17] The Medical Device Manufacturing Association called the victory "a critical step in addressing the anticompetitive and other questionable practices by certain dominant manufacturers".[18]
Industry reform[edit]
In 2002, Kiani was interviewed for a New York Times article titled "Medicine's Middleman" that focused on the practices of Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) and dominant medical suppliers.[19] The article was followed by a series of 18 additional New York Times stories on GPOs over the next two years. After the Times article appeared, The United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights held four hearings regarding these practices, at which Kiani testified twice.[20] Kiani's efforts led media to call Masimo "the poster child for small medical device manufacturers" and observe that Kiani "almost single-handedly galvanized the rancorous debate over the GPO industry's purported role in locking out innovative technologies from the marketplace."[21]
Kiani is active in efforts to reform U.S. health care and encourage medical innovation. In 2010, Kiani and Masimo provided $10 million in funding to create the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation, and Competition in Healthcare, which is dedicated to encouraging and promoting activities that improve patient safety and deliver advanced healthcare worldwide.[22] Masimo Foundation supports third-party research, development initiatives, and clinical studies with an emphasis on transformative projects that seek to truly enhance patient safety and outcomes; helping to forge a world free of sickness, disease and inhumanity.




Joe Kiani testifies at the U.S. Senate HELP Committee.


In 2013 Kiani founded the Patient Safety Movement Foundation through the support of the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation, and Competition in Healthcare. More than 200,000 preventable patient deaths occur each year in U.S. hospitals.[23][24] The Patient Safety Movement is committed to reducing these deaths to zero by 2020. The Foundation also convenes the action-oriented annual Patient Safety, Science & Technology summit.
On September 24, 2013, Kiani appeared before the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee and laid out five steps to help eradicate preventable patient deaths. Senator Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said the hearing was "The most important hearing this committee would hold all year."[citation needed]
Also on September 24, 2013, the Patient Safety Movement announced its Commitment to Action to reduce preventable patient deaths in U.S. hospitals to zero by 2020 at the 2013 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting in New York.[citation needed]
In March 2014, Forbes interviewed Kiani in an article called "Re-Engineering Healthcare To Eliminate Preventable Deaths".[25]
On April 1, 2014, Kiani was named by Becker's Hospital Review as one of "50 Experts Leading the Field of Patient Safety".[26] Kiani was the only patient safety expert named who is also a medical technology company CEO.
Awards and distinctions[edit]
Kiani and Masimo have received more than 50 awards and honors, including:

2015 SafeCare Person of the Year Award that recognizes and applauds the one individual who has contributed significantly towards improving patient safety and healthcare quality across the globe[27]
The Newborn Foundation's Hubert H. Humphrey "Dawn of Life" Award, an award previously reserved for members of the United States Congress. Hubert Humphrey IV, the former Vice President's grandson, presented the award to Kiani as a "visionary leader who has been dedicated to increasing the role of technology and innovation in improving health" of newborns around the world.[28]
Society for Critical Care Medicine Technology Excellence Award (the only recipient of this award to come from industry)[29]
Frost and Sullivan CEO of the Year Award[30]
Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year - 2012 Life Sciences[31]
Argyros Medal for his entrepreneurship, outstanding business accomplishments, service on behalf of patient safety, and dedication and support of Chapman University[32]

Kiani and Masimo have over 575 issued and pending patents worldwide.[15] Under Kiani's leadership, Masimo won a patent infringement award of more than $300 million in damages when it settled a lawsuit against the Nellcor division of Tyco Healthcare (now known as Covidien) for infringing on its patents for measure-through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry in 2006.[16] Kiani and Masimo also won a 2004 lawsuit against Tyco for violating antitrust laws specifically related to the sale of its Nellcor pulse oximetry products and was ultimately awarded $43.5 million.[17] The Medical Device Manufacturing Association called the victory "a critical step in addressing the anticompetitive and other questionable practices by certain dominant manufacturers".[18]
Industry reform[edit]
In 2002, Kiani was interviewed for a New York Times article titled "Medicine's Middleman" that focused on the practices of Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) and dominant medical suppliers.[19] The article was followed by a series of 18 additional New York Times stories on GPOs over the next two years. After the Times article appeared, The United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights held four hearings regarding these practices, at which Kiani testified twice.[20] Kiani's efforts led media to call Masimo "the poster child for small medical device manufacturers" and observe that Kiani "almost single-handedly galvanized the rancorous debate over the GPO industry's purported role in locking out innovative technologies from the marketplace."[21]
Kiani is active in efforts to reform U.S. health care and encourage medical innovation. In 2010, Kiani and Masimo provided $10 million in funding to create the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation, and Competition in Healthcare, which is dedicated to encouraging and promoting activities that improve patient safety and deliver advanced healthcare worldwide.[22] Masimo Foundation supports third-party research, development initiatives, and clinical studies with an emphasis on transformative projects that seek to truly enhance patient safety and outcomes; helping to forge a world free of sickness, disease and inhumanity.




Joe Kiani testifies at the U.S. Senate HELP Committee.


In 2013 Kiani founded the Patient Safety Movement Foundation through the support of the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation, and Competition in Healthcare. More than 200,000 preventable patient deaths occur each year in U.S. hospitals.[23][24] The Patient Safety Movement is committed to reducing these deaths to zero by 2020. The Foundation also convenes the action-oriented annual Patient Safety, Science & Technology summit.
On September 24, 2013, Kiani appeared before the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee and laid out five steps to help eradicate preventable patient deaths. Senator Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said the hearing was "The most important hearing this committee would hold all year."[citation needed]
Also on September 24, 2013, the Patient Safety Movement announced its Commitment to Action to reduce preventable patient deaths in U.S. hospitals to zero by 2020 at the 2013 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting in New York.[citation needed]
In March 2014, Forbes interviewed Kiani in an article called "Re-Engineering Healthcare To Eliminate Preventable Deaths".[25]
On April 1, 2014, Kiani was named by Becker's Hospital Review as one of "50 Experts Leading the Field of Patient Safety".[26] Kiani was the only patient safety expert named who is also a medical technology company CEO.
Awards and distinctions[edit]
Kiani and Masimo have received more than 50 awards and honors, including:

2015 SafeCare Person of the Year Award that recognizes and applauds the one individual who has contributed significantly towards improving patient safety and healthcare quality across the globe[27]

Early life[edit]
Joe Kiani was born in Shiraz, Iran, and emigrated to the United States at the age of nine.[1] Kiani's father was an engineer and his mother was a nurse.[2] Despite not speaking more than three words in English when he arrived in the United States, he graduated from high school at the age of 15 and, by the time he was 22, had earned both his bachelor's (B.S.E.E) and master's (M.S.E.E) degrees in electrical engineering from San Diego State University.[3] In 2005, Kiani was awarded the Monty Distinguished Alumni Award by San Diego State University.[4]
Career at Masimo[edit]
Kiani founded the medical technology company Masimo in 1989 and was later joined by partner Mohammed Diab.[5] The company is now publicly traded and employs more than 3,000 people worldwide.[6] Masimo technologies are used to monitor over 100 million patients per year.[7] According to industry watchers, "...while that accomplishment alone puts him in the same breath as business legends like Apple's Steve Jobs or Microsoft's Bill Gates, Kiani's contribution to the world of medicine may be even more profound."[8] In 2011, Forbes named Masimo to its list of top 20 public companies under a billion dollars in revenue, based on earnings growth, sales growth, and return on equity.[9][10]

On September 24, 2013, Kiani appeared before the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee and laid out five steps to help eradicate preventable patient deaths. Senator Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said the hearing was "The most important hearing this committee would hold all year."[citation needed]
Also on September 24, 2013, the Patient Safety Movement announced its Commitment to Action to reduce preventable patient deaths in U.S. hospitals to zero by 2020 at the 2013 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting in New York.[citation needed]
In March 2014, Forbes interviewed Kiani in an article called "Re-Engineering Healthcare To Eliminate Preventable Deaths".[25]
On April 1, 2014, Kiani was named by Becker's Hospital Review as one of "50 Experts Leading the Field of Patient Safety".[26] Kiani was the only patient safety expert named who is also a medical technology company CEO.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Masimo's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. The company's press release is available at www.masimo.com. At this time, all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
I'm pleased to introduce Eli Kammerman, Masimo's Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Eli Kammerman - Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations
Hello, everyone. Joining me today are Chairman and CEO, Joe Kiani; and Executive Vice President of Finance and CFO, Mark de Raad.
This call will contain forward-looking statements which reflect Masimo's current judgment, including certain of our expectations regarding fiscal 2016 financial performance. However, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections and forecasts are discussed in detail in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. You will find these in the Investor section of our website.
I'll now pass the call to Joe Kiani.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Eli.
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Masimo's second quarter 2016 earnings call. We're happy to again report results that surpassed our projections.
As in the first quarter, we continue to see strong worldwide adhesive sensor growth, which we believe was attributable both to increase in hospital census and our growing base of new customers as evidenced by the prior two quarters' growth and another strong quarter of driver shipments as we shipped 45,300 additional SET and rainbow SET oximeters in Q2, excluding our handheld and finger (sic) [fingertip] (01:56) pulse oximeters.
Here are some of other highlights from our second quarter. Our product sales grew by nearly 12%. Our second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings per share was $0.55, including an $0.08 per share gain related to the new accounting rules for gains realized on stock option exercises, and an approximate $0.04 FX benefit. This is a 58% increase from our GAAP earnings a year ago – 57%, excuse me.
Important new clinical studies (02:32) were published during Q2 continuing to validate the growing list of Masimo technologies and products that are reducing costs and improving patient care. And we received two important FDA clearances, which will expand our domestic product portfolio and on which, I will discuss later in today's call.
We're encouraged that our 10-year plan to achieve strong earnings growth built on a solid foundation of breakthrough products and strong and broad service has continued to become more visible and consistent over the last two years. Encouragingly, our results for the first half of 2016 have exceeded our original projections; and as a result we are very happy to be able to once again increase our financial guidance for the rest of 2016.
Next, Mark will review our second quarter financial results in more detail and also provide you with our new 2016 financial guidance. I will then discuss some additional second quarter business, product, and clinical highlights. Mark?
Mark P. de Raad - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon everybody.
Our second quarter 2016 total revenues were $172.6 million, which was up 10.9% from $155.7 million in the prior year period. Total product revenues rose by 11.5% or 11.1% on a constant currency basis versus the second quarter of 2015.
Product revenues for Q2 exceeded our expectations due, as Joe noted, to both continued strength in attracting new customers, notably in some of our key OUS regions, as well as an increase in U.S. hospital census.
rainbow product revenues for Q2 totaled $14.9 million, which was up 10.6% from $13.5 million in the prior year period. This increase is consistent with our projected total annual rainbow growth of approximately 10%.
Our Q2 SpHb revenues declined to $3.6 million from $4.4 million in the prior year period. This decline was due primarily to a difficult comparison involving two large license orders last year, as well as the slight delay in the shipment of an OUS order, which will now be realized in Q3.
Our worldwide end-user or direct business, which includes sales through just-in-time distributors, grew 12.7% in the second quarter to $140.9 million versus $125.1 million in the year ago period. Our direct business represented approximately 86% of total product revenue in the quarter versus 85% in the prior year period.
OEM sales comprised the remaining 14% and rose by 5.1% versus the prior year period to $23.7 million.
By geography, total U.S. product revenue increased by 10.2% to $117 million compared to $106.2 million in the same quarter of 2015. Our total OUS product revenues of $47.6 million rose by 15% versus $41.4 million in the same prior year period, and were up 13.6% on a constant currency basis. OUS revenues represented approximately 29% of total Q2 product revenues, up from 28% in the prior year quarter.
Our second quarter 2016 GAAP product gross margin was 65.1%, up by 90 basis points from the previous year, 64.2%. This improvement is attributable to a number of factors including a more favorable product mix, the continuing benefits from our value engineering efforts and other manufacturing cost initiatives, as well as favorable FX movements, including the year-over-year decline in the value of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar.
Reported second quarter 2016 total operating expenses were $78.7 million, an increase of $3.6 million or 4.9% versus $75.1 million in the prior year period. Our SG&A expenses were $63.9 million, an increase of $2.2 million or 3.6%, while our R&D spending was $14.8 million, an increase of 10.6% versus the year ago period. The increase in R&D expenses related to additional engineering resources to support both ongoing Masimo new product development efforts, as well as additional staffing related to our commitment to reinvest the medical device tax savings.
Second quarter 2016 operating income was $36.4 million compared to $27.8 million in the prior year period. This significant increase in year-over-year operating income is a result of a combination of factors, including strong product revenue growth, improved product gross margins and continued operating expense control. Encouragingly for the third quarter in a row, our operating income margin has exceeded 21% and in fact was up over 300 basis points above the same prior year quarter.
Q2 2016 non-operating income was approximately $500,000 compared to non-operating expense of $1.1 million in the prior year period. The $500,000 in Q2 non-operating income includes approximately $1 million in net interest expense, related to borrowings under our line of credit, less other interest income. This interest expense was more than offset by approximately $1.5 million in favorable foreign exchange translation gains, resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from April 2, 2016 to July 2, 2016, on our OUS local currency denominated balance sheets.

Our second quarter 2016 effective tax rate fell to 18.6%, down from 30% in the same period last year and well below our expected rate of approximately 30%. This lower than expected Q2 effective tax rate was due to a $4.1 million benefit we recognized related to our adoption of ASU 2016-09, the new accounting rule regarding the reporting of tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options.
As you'll recall, the new accounting rules require that the tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options are reported as a discrete benefit to the current quarter effective tax rate as part of the profit and loss statement. In the past, these tax benefits were reported directly to equity.
Without this discrete item, our adjusted Q2 effective tax rate would have been 29.7%, very close to our 30% projection. As a result of this new accounting rule, our Q2 2016 fully diluted EPS was increased by $0.08 per diluted share, following a $0.02 increase in Q1 2016.
Our average shares outstanding for Q2 were 52.7 million, down from 53.7 million in the year ago period, but up from 51.9 million in Q1 2016. During the Q2 quarter, we repurchased an additional 400,000 shares increasing our year-to-date purchases to 1.5 million shares.
The sequential increase in our Q2 weighted share count was primarily due to the impact that a higher stock price has on the dilutive value of stock options outstanding under the treasury stock method.
Second quarter GAAP net income increased by approximately 55% to $30 million or $0.57 per diluted share, including the $0.08 per diluted share benefit related to the discrete Q2 accounting change and the 4% benefit from movements in foreign exchange rates.
As of July 2, 2016, our DSO was 47 days compared to 52 days as of April 2, 2016, and compared to 46 days as of January 2, 2016.
Our inventory turns remained at 3.7%, consistent with the April 2, 2016, level and were down from 4.2% as of January 2, 2016.
Total cash and cash equivalents as of July 2, 2016, were $116.1 million compared to $132.3 million as of January 2, 2016. During the first six months of the year, we have generated approximately $56.7 million in cash from operations and $19 million from the exercise of stock options. These funds were used in part to repurchase 1.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $63.4 million, and to repay approximately $10 million in our line of credit borrowings and to fund our operations.
During the most recent second quarter alone in addition to the repurchase of approximately 400,000 shares at a cost of approximately $20.5 million, we also repaid $50 million on our line of credit, lowering our total borrowings outstanding from $225 million at the end of Q1 to $175 million at the end of Q2.
Now, I'd like to take just a moment to update our fiscal 2016 financial guidance, which is based on the best information we have available to us. We are now projecting that our total fiscal 2016 GAAP revenues will be approximately $689 million, including $658 million in product revenues, up from our prior estimate of $647 million, which was then up (12:58) from our original fiscal 2016 guidance of $640 million in product revenues.
We now expect our annual GAAP 2016 product gross profit margins to be approximately 65%, up from our prior guidance of 64.7%. We now also expect our fiscal 2016 operating expenses to be approximately $314 million, which is up slightly from our prior guidance of approximately $312 million.
We continue to expect that our tax rate for the remaining six months of fiscal 2016 will be approximately 30%. We are projecting that our average quarterly weighted shares outstanding for the rest of fiscal 2016 to be between $53 million and $54 million. And as a result of these changes, we are now expecting our 2016 GAAP EPS to be approximately $2.01, up from our prior estimate of $1.83 per diluted share, and our original projection at the start of the year of $1.69 per diluted share.

And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Mark.
I want to congratulate our team for our performance through the first half of the year. We intend to continue to achieve results that exemplify our greater growth potential stemming from our breakthrough technologies that have had a profound impact on patient care and cost of care.
As Mark just described, we have once again boosted our full year forecast to incorporate a more positive outlook for 2016. We are realizing higher revenues per drivers across our installed base as utilization has risen.
In addition, steady growth for rainbow and recent regulatory clearances where important new products provide us with greater confidence that we'll exceed our prior target set at the beginning of this year.
We're consistently winning new hospital conversions for Masimo SET and rainbow SET oximeters. During Q2 we received two noteworthy product clearances from the FDA. First, we received FDA clearance for our O3 Regional Oximetry monitor, enabling us to participate in an estimated $125 million market that is growing by 10% annually.
Given the accuracy and ease-of-use of O3 compared to competitive monitors in the field, we hope to capture meaningful share in this market in the next few years. In fact, one of the world's leading centers for cardiovascular medicine and transplantation, DHZB, the German Heart Center in Berlin has adopted our O3 Regional Oximetry and SedLine Brain Function Monitoring technologies to monitor their patients in the operating room and intensive care unit.
DHZB is a specialized hospital dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular and thoracic diseases, implantation of mechanical circulatory support systems, and heart and lung transplantations, and treats more than 7,200 inpatients and 24,000 outpatients annually.
The second novo (16:28) FDA clearance we received in Q2 was for our wearable, tetherless Radius-7 monitor with rainbow measurement capabilities. The rainbow version of Radius-7 allows for patient mobility within the hospital, and includes continuous hemoglobin measurement as an option, which may be useful for detecting post-operative internal hemorrhage.
We also recently initiated the launches of next-generation SedLine and next-generation SpHb products in Europe, both of which incorporate substantially improved technology that increases their clinical utility.
On a related note, we are happy to report that the rollout of rainbow parameters within both low-acuity and high-acuity monitors made by Philips have commenced. GE is also now selling rainbow, and its low-acuity monitor line.
Unfortunately, we've recently learned that GE's rollout of rainbow in their high-acuity monitors would likely be delayed by two years to three years.
On the clinical front, two papers were recently published that support the clinical utility of Masimo's innovative technologies. In a study utilized using the first-generation Pronto Pulse CO-Oximeter to non-invasively measure total hemoglobin and 114 patients, SpHb was successfully measured 89% of the time. With being (18:03) lab-based hemoglobin values of 12.6 plus and minus 1.9 grams per deciliter and mean non-invasive SpHb value of 12.3 plus or minus 1.6 grams per deciliter.
The authors Dr. Ryan and colleagues at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital found that non-invasive and invasive measurements correlated well and that the rapid availability of results and the lack of requirement of venipuncture, noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring may be a valuable adjunct in the initial evaluation and monitoring of pediatric trauma patients.
They also noted that noninvasive SpHb testing may be most effective in determining when invasive testing of hemoglobin is warranted.

A paper just published in Transplantation Proceedings authored by Dr. Lee and colleagues at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan investigated the utility of PVI and concluded that PVI may serve as a reliable estimate of cardiac preload status in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation as higher PVI values correlated with lower right ventricular end-diastolic volume value (19:31), so that an increase in ventricular preload status could be inferred from a decrease in PVI during OLTs.
They also noted that right ventricular end-diastolic volume was better correlated with PVI than with other static filling pressure such as central venous pressure or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; therefore, giving a safer, faster and better estimate of fluid responsiveness.
These two papers are just the latest examples of the high clinical value that our technologies provide to clinicians as they strive to improve patient care.
In fact, we estimate that the use of SET pulse oximeter, rainbow SpHb and PVI will save an average hospital $1.3 million a year. In the age (20:27) of both the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of ACOs, technologies that help clinicians get it right the first time are what hospitals want.
In closing, our focus on delivering on our 10-year plan is based on our guiding principles of remaining faithful to our promises and responsibilities. We are encouraged that our first half of 2016 financial performance has exceeded our original 2006 guidance, and in doing so has allowed us to, once again, increase our financial guidance for the year.
We are looking forward to what will be a record year in 2016 as we head into the final stretch of our 10-year plan in 2017. As always, we remain focused on our mission to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications with our breakthrough noninvasive monitoring technologies.
With that, we'll open the call to questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Lawrence Keusch from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hello.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good afternoon, everyone. Hi, this is – hey, Joe. This is John Shu in for Larry. How are you?
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Oh, good. Hi, John. How are you?
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Doing well, thanks. Doing well. Hey. So, obviously, a very nice quarter, obviously, looking at Mark's comments on the strong operating margin expansion, maybe we could start there, three straight quarters at 21%. Obviously, you want to get up closer to 25% over the next year couple of years. So, again, can you just remind us outside of the gross margin opportunity on the product side with value engineering, kind of what gets us there, and your confidence around the timing for that?
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Certainly. Certainly value engineering work that we've been doing the last few years is resulting in some of those gains. Our value based – our pricing (22:51) with our customers and our discipline with that, along with the expansion of the new products. Obviously, we've been talking about rainbow for a while, but we're seeing excellent growth with SedLine, excellent growth with capnography, and now O3.
So, adding SET, rainbow and now Root, which have these new modalities together along with the open connectivity and creating the connective hub for the hospitals, we think will help us drive strong revenue gains as we manage our expenses to what we believe are sustainable, given the initial investment we made in the first 60%, 70% period of the 10-year plan.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just kind of shifting gears to international. I guess, two quick ones for you. One, the sizing, if you could provide us with the size of the international order in hemoglobin that shifted (24:04) to the third quarter? And then also any updates regarding the size of – and timing for the Middle East tender? Thank you.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, not to get too much into the minutia, all I can say, had we had that order in Q2, our revenues for hemoglobin would have grown 10% instead of being in decline; also given some of the factors of the last (24:33) same quarter a period ago.
But what I can tell you on the Middle East, we're working really well with them. The run rate of sales have been excellent. We did regain the tender that we had won last year. And in fact, the hospitals' run rate for that was probably two times, three times of what we did last year with them.
However, there is pressure from the finance minister for these hospitals to not automatically get what they asked for, so they will be working towards getting what they want, but instead of it being preapproved for the whole year, they'll have to seek it on a regular basis.
So, while all of that will mean not much for this year for us because we've already projected worst case anyway and we are more than happy to meet that with the new projections we gave you, we'll have to track what really happens on the Street in Q3 and Q4 and then hopefully Q1 of next year we can tell you what to expect for the rest of the year based on their historical usage pattern because, unfortunately, we can't rely on the tender request and tender win that we had, given the way the finance minister has, I guess, rammed in (25:58) that freedom from the hospitals, and we'll request additional demands on a regular basis.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, the royalty revenues have, obviously, actually been doing a little bit better versus the prior year. And you did raise guidance by $1 million for the year. So, just any update you can provide us on the status of discussions with Medtronic on royalty agreement?
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We haven't reached any new agreement, but we still remain optimistic that the royalties will continue till October 2018. Given that we won the IPR on two of the patents that they went (26:46) to try to eliminate, the one that we won goes till October 2018. The one that we partially lost expires next month, so that – obviously, the royalties haven't changed. So, we think things will remain till October 2018. And if we can do something more with Medtronic, we'll be announcing it as soon as we have it.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you so much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Great. Hi. Thanks.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hello, Bill.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, Joe.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
How are you doing, Mr. Quirk?
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Doing very well, sir. And it sounds like, based on the quarter, I think you guys are as well.
Quick question, I guess, for perhaps Mark. If I'm doing the math correctly here, Mark, when I net out the change from the accounting treatment, as well as FX and of course, your organic EPS upside in the quarter, it looks like you're assuming – again, outside of accounting and outside of FX – that the incremental upside is going to be driven by the core business. It looks like it's a couple of pennies over the next two quarters relative to previous guidance. Am I doing the math right there?

Mark P. de Raad - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. Yeah. Directionally, that's exactly right.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Okay.
Mark P. de Raad - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
The success we had in the second quarter made us confident enough to take up our projected revenue guidance for both Q3 and Q4 in the range of about $2 million. We also, though, because of the higher amount of weighted shares, ended up essentially you could say effectively losing $0.01, because of the impact of the now projected higher share number for Q3 and Q4. So, the combination of that, the higher revenue of about $2 million each quarter, offset by slightly higher weighted share numbers resulted in a net increase of about $0.01 for both Q3 and Q4.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Okay. Got it, very clear. And just to be clear, Mark, that's obviously organic, I mean, it sounds like any of this change related to tax treatment is obviously going to be triggered upon exercise of options, correct, and doesn't sound like you really have anything dialed in in terms of expectations there?
Mark P. de Raad - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Correct. Yeah. We actually can't, because of the discrete nature of those. We can't even include those in any kind of forward guidance, number one, because it's very difficult, of course, to project what kind of stock option exercises might occur; and secondly, because it simply isn't allowed as part of your forward effective tax rate guidance.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Understood. Okay, thank you. And then a couple for Joe, if I may.
Joe, the comment around the GE high-acuity monitor delay, could you add a little bit of color there? And then separately, just curious, we got the update around Medtronic in the previous question, anything to say on with respect to Philips? Thanks.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure, sure. On the GE, given that, of course, we are in possession of confidential information that I cannot disclose, all I can tell you this delay had nothing to with us. It's something that is an internal issue for them, but with their permission, we wanted to share with you where they are.
The good news is Philips has fully rolled out. Dräger has been out there for a while with rainbow technology. Welch Allyn, ZOLL, and many other OEMs. So, we're anxious to get GE out there, but I know they're doing everything they can, but fortunately, things like this sometimes happen in the product development cycle.
As far as our litigation with Philips, as you know, it's been broken up in four phases. We won phase one for $467 million verdict, which was not finalized, which actually may end up being a good thing with the (31:03) Supreme Court recently changed the standard for willful infringement. We think we have a great willful infringement case against Philips, which will be not only bringing up on the phase 2 coming up in January, but we'll seek to bring back on the phase one victory as well, where they have admitted that they infringed our technology, before even the trial began.
For us the (31:29) Phase 3 that will be the antitrust suit and patents used case (31:34) against us, that would happen in March of next year. And then Phase 4 is some additional patents we have against them along with our antitrust suit against them and that has not been scheduled yet.
So in summary, if I was going to tell you what I think will happen, I think, hopefully, assuming we win the antitrust and patent issues (32:02) in March probably about 18 months after that, I'm sure Philips will appeal it to the Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which we expect we should win. And so we think sometime in about two years from now, we'll have our first check from Philips. And maybe with the prejudgment interest, post-judgment interest, if there is willfulness found (32:32) made, it could be much bigger than the $467 million that we secured in the Phase 1 trial and post-judgment ruling by Judge Stark.

William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Very comprehensive. Thanks, Joe.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. Thank you, Bill. One more question.
Operator
We have a question from the line of Brian Weinstein from William & Blair (sic) [William Blair] (32:58). Your line is open.

Hi. And so...
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good. How are you?
Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC
Good, thanks. So, question for you on market share, where do you guys think you are in market share in pulse oximetry? And what percentage of the available market are you taking every year at this point?
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We don't really know what our market share is, those are difficult to assess. We do believe we are growing two times, three times the rate of growth in the pulse oximetry market given that we're now – we've been growing for almost two years at above 10% rate. So unfortunately, that's all I have for you. I know there is surveys that are done by independent surveying companies. I don't know how much I can trust those, so therefore I don't want to state what they say because I know there are ways of guessing at (33:54) those numbers is not a scientific as how sometimes they're truly done when economists get involved in big case trials and so forth.
Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Mark, question for you on operating expenses, and I guess, Joe, for you as well. You answered various questions, just talking about kind of controls there. But in general, what are you guys doing on the operating expense side to kind of make sure that you're going to continue to get that leverage? And what are the programs that you have in place, and can just give us any more color on how you think about managing OpEx?
Mark P. de Raad - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure, sure Brian. I think as we've been articulating for the past couple of years now actually, we changed really our direction towards planning our future level of total investment in operating expenses, and we changed it from a perspective of identifying various targeted opportunities and ways to expand the business and essentially determining whether to fund those kind of expenses to one in which we just simply said there's a fixed amount of operating expense that we're willing to invest each year and then we work very, very diligently internally to prioritize all of the various spending initiatives that we have. But at the end of the day, we're limiting ourselves to X amount of dollars of spending growth. So because of that approach, obviously there is a tremendous amount of control in terms of our ability to dictate essentially what level of spending we're going to be at. And that's something we started at the end of 2014. It's continued all the way through 2015, and is obviously continuing through this year. And as we look forward for the next couple of years, there is no intention to change that type of forced prioritization of investments in order to hit a fixed amount of aggregate spending dollars increase.
Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks for that answer. And my last question is on pricing. Is there any change here when you're signing new contracts? Joe, you talked about kind of pricing discipline. Are you seeing Medtronic use price or are (36:24) they still being a responsible player? Thank you.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So, I don't think anything has changed on pricing. We see Medtronic doing the same thing that Covidien was doing pricing-wise. Given that we, from clinical studies, have data that shows, we can say that average hospital of 250 beds about $1.3 million a year, we – not to mention the life-saving impact of our technology, the eye damage reduction in the NICU of our technology, we believe our pricing is just right and that's not too low, but consistent to wanting to help our customers reduce cost of care. We always calculate that into our pricing strategy.

So the good news is customers are willing to give us a small premium for the value that our technology brings to them that both saved them money, big money not small pennies, but also helped them take better care of their patients.
Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks.
Joe E. Kiani - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you so much, Brian.
And I want to just add one thing, the reason we can grow our expenses the way that Mark mentioned in a very disciplined fashion is because we had grown, as you know, our infrastructure a little bit ahead of plan, normal plans, the way we would do things given the royalties we were gaining from Covidien, Medtronic. And that has allowed us now – I guess, the last part of our 10-year plan to not have to grow our expenses, yet not be choking the company when it comes to both product that saves lives and helps people, as well as the number of people we need from an infrastructure perspective to treat our customers as they are accustomed to.
So, we're really happy that the 10-year plan is working. We're happy that our investors have stuck by us, and now are seeing the stock working. So we will do our best to continue this commitment to you and look forward to our next quarter results in a few months. Thank you all for joining us.

Joe E. Kiani

By: John Nank |  12:00am EDT January 1, 2007 






For many people, the perfect job is one that provides them with security and the means to a comfortable lifestyle, and actually enjoying what they do doesn’t always come with the package. But for Joe E. Kiani and the approximately 1,000 worldwide employees of
Masimo Corp., an Irvine-based medical technology developer, loving their work goes without saying. Kiani and his workers  whom he
calls “purists” for their love of the job  have ridden a wave of passion in their purpose to great success, with revenue expected to top
$150 million in 2006. Smart Business spoke with Kiani about the importance of integrity, maintaining the right culture and keeping all
your doors open.
Keep your focus.We have unpretentious leadership focused on our guiding principles, great products and great people.
Unpretentious leadership means not pretending to act a certain way you think someone in my role should act, but rather staying focused on what matters, which is great principles, great products and great people.
I see sometimes when I meet other executives that there is an air about them as though they’re playing some part out of a
movie. If you are playing that role, you’re spending more time wondering how people perceive you rather than just doing what
you’re supposed to do and trying to fulfill expectations.
Whether you’re making ice cream or, in our case, noninvasive blood monitors, you have to stay focused on good principles,
making a good product and hiring the best people you can. We’re here to exceed our customers’ expectations by making great
products and services.
The dangers of growing too fast are that, No. 1, you could disappoint your customers if you can’t maintain the quality of both
the product and the people. No. 2, you might bring on people too fast that might not be a great fit for the culture.
We’re very worried about that, so we’re watching those things very closely, and I spend a lot of time with operations and with
the teams to make sure everyone knows how important it is to not lose sight of those things. You have to keep making sure the
new people that come are acclimated to the culture, but it hasn’t been difficult and we’ve been able to do it because we made
sure the core of the people we had were cut from the same cloth.
Since we’ve gotten bigger, it’s those people  not me  that are teaching the new people what matters and why we’re all here.
Be available to your staff.That saying, ‘open-door policy,’ is a good way to say it because your door has to be open. If you close
that door too often, people will … just stop coming by because they know you don’t want to see them.
When someone does sneak their head in, unless you’re doing something that’s very, very important that’s got to be done in a
timely basis, you’ve really got to put it down, put a big smile on your face and react to whatever issues people are bringing to
you.
I have a lot of things I want to get done during a day, and I find I get very few of them done during the day. I do them after my
kids go to sleep and I do them until about midnight, because I don’t want to take away that time for anyone to walk in and talk
to me.
As I go around my executive team, if I see people don’t have that, in a friendly way I try to remind them to open their doors and
remind them that their job is to be a leader more than getting a particular job done. The most important thing is to make sure …
each level agrees on the same values and has the same culture, because they’re going to be the ones who are going to touch the
next level the most.
We’ve grown by 50 percent in the last year, so even if I wanted to, there’s no way I could meet with everybody and spend time
with everybody as much as I need to. 
Guide your company by your own principles.Business principles should be no different than an individual’s highest principles.
Before I started Masimo, I was involved in a company when I was 22 or 23 years old, and it was the first time I was at a high level
in a company.
The businesspeople there were about to sell the company to another company, and they were making false statements about
how far the product was. I had to really think about it, because at that point, I was wondering if maybe that was how business
was done.
It was a very painful process for me to step up and say no, and I wrote a letter to the CEO and the chairman of the board and
told them where the product actually was. It wasn’t pretty, but at that moment I realized that your personal principles  hopefully they’re good ones  have to be the company’s. The entity does not take on some ruthless, whatever-it-takes kind of principle; it’s got to be yours.
Integrity is the most important trait a business leader can have. I hope, whatever happens, to not lose sight of our principles. I
say that because our human nature sometimes goes against what we should be doing, so it’s a constant fight.
I hope I’m close enough to the customer and the technology that I can maintain the vision for the company and keep an appreciation for the talent, the people, because at the end of the day, you can have great vision and integrity, but if you don’t have the
people to execute, you’re not going to make it.
Success is being happy most of the time, which can only be attained if you live up to your own principles. Success for the company is the same; building a successful company based on principles and integrity, not greed and power.

Board of Directors

  

Joe E. Kiani, Chairman
As Chairman of the Board of Masimo Foundation, Mr. Kiani brings vision, expertise, and proven management capabilities to the Foundation. His responsibilities include serving as the Foundation's Chief Executive Officer, leading and overseeing the Board of Directors in the fulfillment of its duties, providing policy leadership, and presiding at meetings of the Board. He receives no compensation from the Foundation.
Mr. Kiani is also Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Masimo Corporation, a global medical technology company that develops and manufactures innovative non-invasive patient monitoring technologies. Masimo is the primary contributor to the Foundation. Mr. Kiani founded Masimo in 1989 as a private company to improve the accuracy of noninvasive patient monitoring. Under his leadership, Masimo has grown from a “garage start up” into a successful publicly traded medical technology company employing over 2,000 people worldwide and increasing product revenue four-fold in the last five years. Since 1998, Mr. Kiani has also been the CEO and Chairman of Masimo Labs, a research and development company focused on non-invasive monitoring. Mr. Kiani has served on the board of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association since 2002, and is the past Chair of MDMA. Mr. Kiani has testified before the US Senate and FTC on issues related to Group Purchasing Organizations, and the patent system. Mr. Kiani is also on the Board of Trustees of Chapman University, and an Advisor to the College of Engineering of San Diego State University. Mr. Kiani holds a B.S.E.E. and an M.S.E.E. from San Diego State University and is an inventor on more than 50 patents.





  
 Stephen C. Jensen, Director
Stephen C. Jensen is a partner at Knobbe, Martens, Olson & Bear LLP, one of the largest intellectual property law firms in the country.  He has been practicing law for over 25 years, with most of that representing innovative medical technology companies.  Mr. Jensen received his J.D., Order of the Coif, at the University of California - Los Angeles in 1990, and his B.S. in Electrical Engineering , magna cum laude, from Brigham Young University in 1987.  Prior to becoming a lawyer, he worked for Hughes Aircraft where he was involved in development of airborne radar systems.
He served on the Board of Directors of Sedline, Inc, a company that developed non-invasive brain function monitoring products.  He also served as the Senior Vice President of OEM Business and Business Development at Masimo Corporation, and currently serves on the board of directors of Cercacor Corporation, a company that is developing non-invasive monitoring technology.   He brings true passion for patient safety, particularly through innovation.  He believes that if we apply Voltaire’s principal of “no problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking,” and stop worrying about who gets credit, we can solve any patient safety problems presented.
Mr. Jensen, with his wife and five children have been serving the vision impaired community for over a decade, through their passion for raising seeing-eye dogs.  These dogs are provided to the vision impaired at no charge.  He also provided volunteer service overseas for about a year and a half before finishing his undergraduate degree.





 

Sarah Kiani, Director
Sarah has been a devoted  mother, wife and philanthropist since the age of 21.  She has served as a  member of the Board of Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation, and  Competition in Healthcare a year after its founding.   The foundation  has focused on improvement of patient care with many projects, including  the founding of Patient Safety, Science and Technology Summit  (patientsafetysummit.org).   She and her husband, Joe Kiani, have also  been involved in various international projects, including building  schools in Uganda with their support of Clinton Global Initiatives.
In addition, Sarah has been involved in many local programs, including the  Booster club at George White Elementary School, where she spearheaded  various programs including raising money to buy all Apple computers for  the computer lab.  She and her husband have also helped the school by improving  its image and communications with the entire school community.  In  addition, Sarah chaired the March of Dimes fundraising event in 2003, and together with her husband is leading this year’s MOD Walk, as they did for  Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in 2009 for their annual walk.
Sarah has also involved her daughters, Kayla and Nessa, in volunteerism as  they tutored students at a title 1 elementary school in Santa Ana.  Kayla  and Nessa have made gift bags for kids at CHOC hospital during holidays  and have taken care of families for the holidays sponsor meals.
Sarah has been a student of nutrition and its impact on  children and  has become an expert in proper diet and supplements to encourage a  healthy mind and body.





 

Mary Kiani, Director
Mary was a full-time dentist when her brother, Joe Kiani, founded Masimo. With a strong desire to help her brother launch the company, Mary pitched in whenever she could on whatever was needed—fundraising, conducting patent searches, organizing investor meetings, and even fielding calls on behalf of the company.  As the only member of the Board with medical credentials, Mary was Masimo’s original Director of Medical Affairs. With Mary’s invaluable contributions, it wasn’t long before the fledgling Masimo took flight.
Mary has always had a keen interest in all aspects of healthcare, especially patient safety. When Joe founded the Patient Safety Movement Foundation in 2012, Mary was eager to help. She was a key lieutenant in the army of volunteers that organized the inaugural Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summit in January 2013. She continues to help shepherd the Patient Safety Movement towards its ambitious goal of eliminating all preventable patient deaths by 2020.
Outside of her endeavors in healthcare, both with Masimo and as a practicing dentist, Mary has devoted her time to Orange County's public schools by participating in local Parent Teacher Association (PTA) chapters.  She has served on the PTA Council for four years and was the President of Laguna Beach Unified School District's middle school and high school.
Mary received her B.S. degree from San Diego State University at the age of 19. She earned her D.D.S. at the age of 23 from Creighton University in Omaha, NE.
