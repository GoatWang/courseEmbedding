This is a refurbished instrument. These guitars are sent directly from the manufacturer to the authorized refurbishing center where they are fully inspected and cleared by a certified technician. The guitars are sent there for many reasons, including: Cosmetic flaws, Minor repairs & Discontinued Models. Most of the Instruments that we sell have no flaws. For any that do, we will describe the flaw or repair in the listing and include a photo if it is visible. Some item specifics may vary from stock description above. "The actual guitar for sale is shown in the photographs" All of our guitars come with a new standard factory setup, but may require a small amount of fine tuning to fit the players personal taste. In order to prevent false warranty claims, the guitar is given a new serial number and the back of the headstock is lightly stamped "used" or "2nd" by the authorized refurbishing center. These guitars are the next best thing to buying new!
Condition: :  The authorized technician found no issues with the guitar. It has no flaws or repairs noted. Otherwise, It is in like new mint condition. The included case may have a few scuffs and/or scratches but is also in excellent condition. Save Big!
