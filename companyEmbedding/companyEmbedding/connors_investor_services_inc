Connors At A Glance

Founded by James M. Connors in 1969, son Peter J. Connors has been president since 2004.
One of the early adopters of utilizing option writing strategies to minimize the volatility associated with individual stock investing. The Chicago Board Options Exchange began trading in 1973.
Focused on utilizing both individual equity options and major index options—S&P500®, Russell 2000®, ETFs , etc.
Licensed to use BXM(SM) by Standard & Poor’s since 2004.
Options strategies available at some of the largest U.S. broker-dealers.
Strong family and community values.




At Connors Investor Services, Inc., we’re proud to serve a diverse set of clients – including institutions, financial advisors, and individual investors.
Founded in 1969, Connors originally focused on publishing research for financial advisors around the country. The Connors Report, Connors In-Depth Growth Studies, and Connors Option Service were some of the first research publications produced exclusively for investment advisory firms throughout the United States.
By 1974, that focus shifted solely to investment management. Today, we continue to do our own research and in-depth analysis, focusing our efforts on building tailored-made portfolios that will help clients best meet their objectives.
Our depth of knowledge, the credentials of our associates, and the company’s unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional service are all at the root of helping our clients achieve their financial goals. It’s how we’ve always worked since 1969, and always will.
If you’d like to work with us—a registered investment advisory firm with over 40 years of experience – we invite you to get to know us. And see if this is the right relationship for you.
Please Note: Connors Investor Services, Inc. does not serve as an attorney, accountant or insurance agent. Connors Investor Services, Inc. does not prepare estate planning documents or tax returns, nor does it sell insurance products.

31 Jan Quarterly Letter to Clients – January 2017

Posted at 21:04h
							in Connors News 
								by								Connors



0  Likes 

U.S. stocks showed strength in 2016 that surprised most analysts. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 3.2% in the fourth quarter and 9.5% for the entire year, not including dividends. Investors don’t like uncertainty, it is said, but November 8 removed that cloud, as the election of Donald Trump put an individual in the White House who has promised many steps to help businesses and increase their profits.
A number of recent economic reports have also helped investor optimism. While gross domestic product continues to show annual rates of increase of only 2.0% or less, hours worked have been increasing while unemployment decreased to a 4.6% rate in the fourth quarter. Particularly encouraging was the Department of Labor report that the productivity of American workers rose 3.1% in the third quarter, the fastest pace in two years, while labor costs slowed after a large increase in the spring. This improvement in productivity followed three quarterly declines and was the best increase since the one of 4.2% in the third quarter of 2014. We have often noted the importance of this measure since increased productivity can lead not only to higher corporate profits but also to an improved standard of living.
While time will tell which items Trump can accomplish from his lengthy to-do list, and at what pace, it is clear that voter desire for change, both here and elsewhere in the world, has substantially altered the political landscape. Since Barack Obama took office eight years ago with his promise of change at the time, the Democrats have lost over 80 House seats, 12 Senate seats and over 10 Governorships. Most recently, the swing to Republican control has continued even while Obama’s approval rating moved up to its highest level in four years. Of greater interest to investors are the prospects for change in 2017. We have entered the year with a strong but not dramatically growing economy, with both domestic product and inflation increasing at annual rates of about 2%. The Federal Reserve has instituted one small increase in interest rates, but has also indicated the likelihood of several more in the current year if the economy continues to strengthen with concurrent inflationary pressures. Good economic momentum and improving productivity are the right ingredients for the growth of corporate earnings – and therefore are positive factors for stock market performance as well. If the new Administration is successful in scrapping some corporate regulations and reducing taxes, earnings should benefit even more. While current stock prices as measured by the popular averages are not cheap by historic standards, neither are they wildly expensive. Thus, given our outlook for the economy overall and for corporate earnings in particular, we feel that a positive outlook for equities is in order, though corrections can certainly be expected from time to time. It is a particularly bad time, we believe, to chase stocks with high price/earnings multiples as they can be hit the hardest when corrections do occur.
Our very best wishes for the New Year.

About



Connors Investor Services, Inc. is a registered investment advisor managing portfolios for a wide range of individual and institutional clients. The firm was founded in 1969 as a publisher of in-depth securities research, and in 1975 discontinued its publications business to concentrate solely on investment management. Today, Connors manages each account individually, employing a variety of common stock and fixed income investments in response to each client's income and capital growth needs, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. The firm assumes discretionary management responsibility for these portfolios and, when appropriate, recommends other investment manager specialties beyond those offered in-house. Our objectives are to understand client goals and objectives, to design a mix of investment strategies which will best achieve those goals, to manage client investments as effectively as possible, and to communicate regularly and clearly what is being accomplished on our clients' behalf.The professional relationships we establish with our clients are personal. We begin every new assignment the same way: by taking the necessary time to know and understand the needs of the people for whom we manage assets.
