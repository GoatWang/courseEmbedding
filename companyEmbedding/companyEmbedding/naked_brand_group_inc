On January 18, 2017, Naked announced that it had entered into a letter of intent (“LOI”) with Bendon Limited (“Bendon”), for a proposed business combination (the “Business Combination”). The LOI was amended on February 9, 2017. Completion of the Business Combination is subject to the negotiation of a definitive agreement (the “Definitive Agreement”) between the parties, satisfaction of the conditions negotiated therein and approval of the Business Combination by Naked’s stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a Definitive Agreement will be entered into or that the proposed Business Combination will be consummated. Further, those portions of the previously announced LOI, as amended, that described the proposed Business Combination, including the consideration to be issued therein, is non-binding. Assuming Naked and Bendon enter into the Definitive Agreement, the parties will look to seek shareholder approval from Naked’s shareholders. In connection therewith, Naked intends to file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including a definitive proxy statement. Such documents are not currently available. Before making any voting or investment decision with respect to the Business Combination, investors and security holders of Naked are urged to read the definitive proxy statement and the other relevant materials filed or to be filed with the SEC carefully and in their entirety when they become available because they will contain important information about Naked, Bendon and the proposed Business Combination. The definitive proxy statement and other relevant materials (when they become available), and any other documents filed by Naked with the SEC, may be obtained free of charge at the SEC web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, investors and security holders of Naked may obtain free copies of the documents filed with the SEC by Naked by directing a written request to: Naked Brand Group Inc., 95 Madison Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10016, Attention: Investor Relations.Read MoreThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.Participants in the SolicitationNaked and its directors, executive officers and certain other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Naked in connection with the proposed Business Combination. Information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitation of the stockholders of Naked and a description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, will be contained in the definitive proxy statement regarding the proposed Business Combination and other relevant materials to be filed with the SEC by Naked when they become available. Additional information regarding the directors and executive officers of Naked is also included in Naked’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016, and the proxy statement for Naked’s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. These documents are available free of charge at the SEC’s web site (www.sec.gov) and from Investor Relations at Naked at the address described above.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this press release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections and statements relating to Naked’s, Bendon’s and/or the combined company’s business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in or incorporated by reference into this press release regarding strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected expenses, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. Examples of such statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the structure, timing and completion of the proposed Business Combination; Naked’s continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market until closing of the proposed Business Combination; the combined company’s listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market after closing of the proposed Business Combination; when Naked expects to seek shareholder approval of the Business Combination; expectations regarding the capitalization, resources and ownership structure of the combined company; the adequacy of the combined company’s capital to support its future operations; Naked’s, Bendon’s and combined company’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions; the nature, strategy and focus of the combined company; anticipated growth rates; potential future acquisitions; the executive and board structure of the combined company; and expectations regarding voting by Naked’s stockholders. Naked and/or Bendon may not actually achieve the plans, carry out the intentions or meet the expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and performance could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties associated with stockholder approval of and the ability to consummate the proposed Business Combination through the process being conducted by Naked and Bendon, the ability of Naked to enter into a definitive agreement regarding the Business Combination and to consummate such transaction, the ability to project future cash utilization and reserves needed for contingent future liabilities and business operations, the availability of sufficient resources of the combined company to meet its business objectives and operational requirements, the ability to realize the expected synergies or savings from the proposed Business Combination in the amounts or in the timeframe anticipated, the risk that competing offers or acquisition proposals will be made, the ability to integrate Naked’s and Bendon’s businesses in a timely and cost-efficient manner, the inherent uncertainty associated with financial projections, and the potential impact of the announcement or closing of the proposed Business Combination on customer, supplier, employee and other relationships. Naked disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170307005303/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKristin Beck, transgender Navy SEAL hero: 'Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy'Business InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredHighest ranking retired transgender officer slams new plan: I think Trump is ‘being influenced by Pence’Business InsiderTrump’s big Foxconn announcement will bring jobs — and robotsYahoo FinanceAmazon’s Echo rivaled by Xiaomi and Facebook: rptYahoo Finance VideoDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredAmazon earnings — What you need to know in markets on ThursdayYahoo FinanceFix My Finances: I borrowed from my 401(k)Yahoo FinanceFacebook shares hit record high as mobile ad sales soarReutersTrunk Club.

Naked® (http://www.thenakedshop.com) is one of the world''s most luxurious and environmentally conscious underwear brands Naked added Daymond John and his marketing firm as consultants and Daymond as one of its advisors - Daymond John took FUBU a well know clothing company from nothing to a 6 billion $ company http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/daymond-john-to-consult-on-naked-underwear-brand-6405218   "In an interview with  Business Vancouver back in May, 2012, Naked Brand Group's president stated that he planned to take the company public within the month via a reverse takeover with a shell company on the loosely regulated OTCBB exchange. (Accomplished) Primus continued by stating that  "His goal is to be on the junior Nasdaq exchange sometime in 2013."     Naked Brand Group Inc. (NAKD)  (the "Company" or "Naked") is pleased to announce it has shipped its products to 39 of Nordstrom''s best stores across the country and onnordstrom.com, giving Naked an immediate distribution channel through one of the nation''s most sought after department stores. The Nordstrom launch, which occurs this week, will be supported by a national public relations campaign and Nordstrom marketing campaign. Naked has the opportunity to expand into 117 Nordstrom full-line stores. "We are excited about partnering with Nordstrom, a prestigious retailer who has long focused on providing premium products and high-quality service to its customers. Naked''s expansion into the number one rated luxury department store in the United States is a significant milestone for the Company as it builds a department store brand with universal appeal," stated Joel Primus, President and CEO of Naked. He goes on to say, "Naked can now be found in two of North America''s top retail chains. We will continue to pursue additional distribution opportunities through other major US department stores." Nordstrom will carry all of Naked''s product lines including its underwear, undershirts and fashion t-shirts from its Naked® Cotton, Naked® Micromodal® and Naked® Microfibre collections. Naked''s Cotton collection is made with high gauge soft-to-the-touch Pima Cotton and its Naked® Micromodal® collection, made with imported fabric from Italy, is so luxurious and soft that it makes you feel like you''re wearing nothing at all. Nordstrom has grown from one downtown Seattle store into a nationwide fashion speciality chain with renowned service and a selection of the finest apparel, shoes and accessories for the entire family. This year Nordstrom announced that they would be expanding beyond the U.S. into Canada. Construction has now begun in Naked''s hometown of Vancouver on Nordstrom''s first BC location, featuring 230,000 sq. feet of shopping over three floors, which is expected to be their largest Canadian store. The initial order from Nordstrom will represent approximately 60% of year to date revenue for the Company at the time of shipment.   Naked® selects only the finest fabrics from around the world. Our Naked® micromodal fabric is spun on a 44 gauge machine and is softer than silk. Our Naked ® microfiber fabric is spun with distilled water from the Italian Alps and has a smooth, clean finish.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

WE ARE NAKED.Naked was founded on one basic desire: to create a new standard for 
how products worn close to the skin fit, feel and function. We have 
spent years developing designs and fabrics that feel like nothing else. 
Like you are wearing nothing at all. So you feel how you want to feel: 
free, unencumbered and empowered. We know because that’s how we feel 
when we wear them.
SHOP NAKEDOur CompanyEstablished in 2010 by founder Joel Primus in Vancouver, Naked (OTCQB: NAKDD) has
 a strong and growing footprint. We are strategically placed in some of 
the best online and department stores in North America. In 2014, 
renowned designer and sleepwear pioneer Carole Hochman joined as Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Creative Officer and Chairwoman.
Naked is intent on becoming a global lifestyle brand for both women 
and men. We are hard at work developing amazing women’s intimate 
apparel, sleepwear and loungewear—the kind of extraordinary products for
 which Carole Hochman has been admired for years. These women’s 
collections will be introduced in 2015. Meanwhile, we are committed to 
constantly optimizing and innovating our men’s collections. In the 
future, we see Naked moving into other apparel and product categories 
that exemplify the mission of our brand, such as activewear, swimwear, 
sportswear and beyond.

Management TeamCarole Hochman
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Creative Officer and ChairwomanCarole Hochman is a renowned designer and sleepwear pioneer. She is 
considered one of the single most influential women in the intimate 
apparel and sleepwear business in the United States. She has been 
creating intimate apparel for more than 30 years and was the driving 
force behind the Carole Hochman Design Group, for which she served as 
Chief Creative Officer until her departure in 2013 and for which she was
 previously CEO until its acquisition by the Komar in 2010. Under 
Carole’s leadership, Carole Hochman Design Group manufactured Carole

an innate ability to identify opportunities and trends and forecast 
successful endeavors that the rest of the industry quickly follows. She 
was one of the first designers to embrace the concept of QVC, 
recognizing the power of the home shopper, a customer who has proved 
loyal to her from the start.
“When I first met Joel Primus, I felt an immediate chemistry and 
synergy. The brand name lends itself to the creation of something 
dynamic and extraordinary, not only in the intimates industry, but 
beyond. Naked can be translated into all products that touch your skin 
and interact with your body, and I am thrilled to help the brand grow 
and expand into new directions.”  
	
Joel Primus
President and founderJoel is the founder and creative visionary behind Naked. Inspired by 
his exposure to performance apparel during his athletic career and 
luxurious fabrics while traveling South America, Joel sought to create 
Naked. His vision was to create an innovative apparel brand that would 
combine performance and luxury to redefine the way clothing worn close 
to the skin fits, feels and functions. In the promotion of Naked, Joel 
has appeared on CBC’s Dragons’ Den three times in addition to 
Entertainment Tonight Canada, eTalk in Canada, Urban Rush, Shaw TV’s The
 Express and The Fanny Kiefer Show. Joel was recently selected as one of
 BC Business’ Top 30 Under 30 entrepreneurs and has funded the creation 
of multiple computer labs in Ghana through his charity, Project World 
Citizen.
“What gets me excited to go to work every day is knowing that the
 sale of our products contributes to the empowerment and freedom of 
people through education-based charities. I also love knowing that when 
someone wears Naked, they feel the difference and it gives them an edge 
to take on their day
	—whatever it holds.”
“My favorite Naked underwear is our Microfiber Boxer Brief. I’ve 
been working out in them, traveling in them and wearing them under suits
 for over five years now. No matter what I do or where I go they 
function, feel and look good.”

Naked Shop Investors





























































WE ARE NAKED.Naked was founded on one basic desire: to create a new standard for how products worn close to the skin fit, feel and function. We have spent years developing designs and fabrics that feel like nothing else. Like you are wearing nothing at all. So you feel how you want to feel: free, unencumbered and empowered. We know because that’s how we feel when we wear them.













Our companyEstablished in 2010 by founder Joel Primus in Vancouver, Naked (OTCQB: NAKD) has a strong and growing footprint. We are strategically placed in some of the best online and department stores in North America. In 2014, renowned designer and sleepwear pioneer Carole Hochman joined as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Creative Officer and Chairwoman. Naked is intent on becoming a global lifestyle brand for both women and men. We are hard at work developing amazing women’s intimate apparel, sleepwear and loungewear—the kind of extraordinary products for which Carole Hochman has been admired for years. These women’s collections will be introduced in 2015. Meanwhile, we are committed to constantly optimizing and innovating our men’s collections. In the future, we see Naked moving into other apparel and product categories that exemplify the mission of our brand, such as activewear, swimwear, sportswear and beyond.
