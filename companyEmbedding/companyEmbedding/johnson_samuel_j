Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma and Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma is the nickname given to the world's vast and influential pharmaceutical industry and its trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Big Pharma and medical device companies make billions of dollars every year selling drugs and devices — including those that were recalled or involved in fraud or product liability lawsuits.Jump To TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryJump To TopicSelect TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryThe pharmaceutical industry — nicknamed Big Pharma — is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global revenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1 trillion in 2014. But nowhere else in the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and make as much money as in the U.S.
In fact, Americans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. By 2020, it will be $610 billion. Medical devices are also lucrative. The U.S. makes up about half of the world’s share of the market at about $148 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

US based big pharma companies
Meanwhile, drug prices continue to rise. Consulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices for Americans under age 65 to rise 11.6 percent in 2017. In contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent, leaving many American unable to afford their medications.
Big Pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through application fees (user fees) for its new products. Experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA’s budget.
Five of the top 10 pharma and medical device companies for 2016 are headquartered in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead and AbbVie.
The underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud, bribery, product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail.” Despite criminal charges and fines, the companies continue to do business.
Who is Big Pharma?
The majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies. Prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits. The biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices.
Pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices.


The most powerful drug and device companies are members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) — the industry’s U.S. lobbying organization.

With the help of staggering profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists, the industry spreads its influence on Capitol Hill. From 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses — more than any other industry. In 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million — more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined.

Fact
Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma.

Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact, they are the second most hated industry in the U.S. They are also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the False Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.
The Reputation Institute evaluated public perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies for products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship and financial performance. The Institute based its results on 16,800 ratings from the U.S., U.K., Canada and other countries.
Of all the countries, the U.S. had the lowest opinion of pharmaceutical companies. Older people had the most favorable view of the industry.

Medical Device Manufacturers
Medical devices can be anything from hospital diagnostic equipment to hip and knee implants. Several companies only produce medical devices, but some drug manufacturers, such as Johnson & Johnson, also manufacture devices.

Fact
Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).

Like Big Pharma, medical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group to pursue their interests in Washington.Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).
In 2016, it contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds. Its efforts concentrate on medical device friendly bills in Congress mostly related to how companies pay taxes.
Five of the top medical devices companies have their headquarters in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Baxter International, Abbott Laboratories, Stryker and Boston Scientific.

Big Pharma’s Influence
Critics contend that Big Pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, the FDA and the public to increase sales.
The public is exposed to Pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising. For example, critics say AbbVie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as AndroGel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men. They created a marketing campaign around the condition “Low T” that featured a quiz for men to self-diagnose Low T symptoms.

Androgel, above, was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up
The testosterone market soared into the billions as a result. But few studies back up drug-company claims that the drug significantly enhances mood, vitality and sexual performance. Studies also link these drugs to heart problems. The FDA added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk.
The American public is not the only sector of society influenced by Big Pharma’s techniques. Doctors, scientists and research organizations, medical journals, teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to Big Pharma.
Doctors conduct research with funds from Big Pharma. Private charities and foundations account for a mere 5 percent of the estimated $100 billion spent on biomedical research in the U.S. each year. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately 60 percent.
Big Pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout.

 The trade group PhRMA has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena, including:

36 who worked for a member of Congress
13 who worked for a federal agency
12 who worked for a congressional committee
Two who worked for the White House
One who worked in the court system


Using these connections to pursue industry goals, Big Pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest.
Marketing, Research and Development (R&D) and Drug Cost
Americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases, thousands of dollars more per prescription. Big Pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug.

Cost Facts
While companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.

The truth is that U.S. law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from free-market competition. Other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug. The true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery, with many unverifiable figures reported by Big Pharma.
Donald Light, a professor and expert on the pharma business model, said that while companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.
The industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing, which is almost double what it spends on research.
Big Pharma Sways Opinions
The large amount of cash Big Pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on direct-to-consumer advertising. The U.S. is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on TV (the other is New Zealand).


In 2015, Big Pharma spent $5.4 billion on direct-to-consumer ads and fired off about 80 ads an hour, according to Nielsen.

Big Pharma also employs doctors, researchers and institutions.
The industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting, paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal.

Paid copywriters were used in advertising Paxil,

Often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product. Big Pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs, including the antidepressant Paxil, the recalled weight loss drug Fen-Phen, the anti-epilepsy drug Neurontin, the antidepressant Zoloft and painkiller Vioxx, to name a few.
In addition, even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal, it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on Big Pharma’s payroll.
These slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence. Yet Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, says, “All journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry.”

Big Pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications. Consider the numbers:

Advertising instead of research: For every $1 spent on “basic research,” Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions and advertising.
Distribution of free drug samples: The U.S. has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five office-based physicians.
Sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions: Drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors, including covering meals, travel, seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations.


Many medical journals, including the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), actively vie for the attention of Big Pharma advertising dollars, billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership.
How Big Pharma Influences Doctors and Researchers
Part of Big Pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive, brand name drugs.

Fact
In 2012, Big Pharma spent $24 billion on physician advertising, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.

Drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty. One 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than $20 they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug.
According to ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs investigation, 1,866 companies paid $6.25 billion to doctors and hospitals from August 2013 to December 2015.

Drug and Device Company Payments to Doctors from Select Companies, August 2013 to December 2015:



Company
PAYMENTS




DePuy (Johnson & Johnson)
$167 million


Stryker Corporation
$153 million


AstraZeneca
$145 million


Pfizer
$128 million


Janssen Pharmaceuticals
$106 million


GlaxoSmithKline
$86.3 million


Boston Scientific
$77 million




Big Pharma and Researchers
Then there are medical researchers, who are hardly immune to Big Pharma’s financial power. Because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer, too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers.
Sponsors keep the data, analyze it, write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication. Drug companies also stage-manage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light.
Medical Schools and Big Pharma
Big Pharma has also infiltrated medical schools. Teachers, department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors. This influences educational content. Money from Big Pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals, and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs.


The result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drug-intensive style of medicine.

Sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer, more expensive drugs are always better than old ones.
In most states, doctors must also take accredited education courses, called continuing medical education (CME). The pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on CME annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool.
In addition, academic centers are able to receive royalties from Big Pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds.
Columbia University, for example, received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the 17-year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products.
Columbia University received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesBig Pharma Fraud Settlements
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud, according to Public Citizen’s 2013 report Pharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.

Fact
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud.

The most common charge involved drug-pricing scams against state Medicaid programs. This meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while Big Pharma made billions.
Unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements. But these investigations take many years to complete. By then, drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion, while the U.S. Department of Justice fine is typically only a few million.
This makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies, according to Michael Bobelian of Forbes Magazine.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersJohnson & JohnsonJohnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson is the largest healthcare company in the world and consistently remains at the top of the Big Pharma list of powerful corporations. With annual revenue of $71.89 billion, J&J ranked number one among drug companies by revenue in 2016. It easily outranked the second-largest company, Bayer, with revenue of $51.4 billion.Jump To TopicHistoryTylenol CrisisRisperdal ControversyProblematic Drugs & Medical DevicesMultibillion-dollar Drug PipelineJump To TopicSelect TopicHistoryTylenol CrisisRisperdal ControversyProblematic Drugs & Medical DevicesMultibillion-dollar Drug PipelineEstablished: 1886
Headquarters: New Brunswick, New Jersey
2016 Revenue: $71.89 billion
Founders: Robert, James and Edward Johnson
Size: 127,100 employees
Subsidiaries: Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Ethicon, DePuy Orthopaedics, McNeil Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co., Neutrogena and more
Since three Johnson brothers founded it in 1886, J&J has built a health care empire that includes prescription and over-the-counter drugs, orthopedic implants, surgical products and household products. The most popular brands include Band-Aids, Tylenol, Johnson’s Baby Power and Acuvue contact lenses.
While J&J is famous for its consumer health care products such as baby powder, 91 percent of its revenue comes from prescription drugs and medical devices.
The company is broken into three divisions: consumer health care, medical devices and diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals. The company has approximately 250 subsidiaries, including Cilag, DePuy, Ethicon, Janssen, McNeil and Neutrogena.
J&J is also one of the most admired drug companies. In 2017, it ranked 13 in Fortune’s Most Admired Companies list — the only drug company to crack the top 50.
Johnson & Johnson Headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey 
The heath care giant professes to put the people before profits. Its mission statement, called “Our Credo,” begins with, “We believe our first responsibility is to the doctors, nurses and patients, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services.”
But those harmed by the megacorporation’s products might question this credo.
Despite J&J’s accolades and its success, the company has also had its fair share of scandals, government investigations, drug and device recalls and lawsuits related to products that injured thousands of people.
In fact, a notable investigation by Steven Brill for Huffington Post Highline called J&J “America’s most admired lawbreaker.”
The History of Johnson & Johnson
The three Johnson brothers — Robert, James and Edward — founded the company in 1886 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Their initial focus was on bandages, sterile sutures, wound care and baby products. Their first-aid kits, originally sold to railroad workers, would later become a staple in nearly every household. They also sold women’s health products, including sanitary protection products and maternity kits with first-aid products to assist in home births. J&J celebrated its 130th anniversary in 2016.
Band-Aids and Baby Powder
J&J employee Earle Dickson invented Band-Aid adhesive bandages in 1920, the first self-applied dressing for small wounds sold commercially.
Frederick Kilmer, the director of J&J’s Scientific Affairs from 1889 to 1934, was renowned for pitching antiseptic methods for treating wounds. He distributed a booklet with a summary of doctor and surgeon views on wound care. Another of his accomplishments was marketing talcum powder to soothe skin and selling it as baby powder.
Birth Control Revolution
From 1963 to 1973, under the leadership of then-CEO Philip Hofmann, J&J sold birth control and personal care products and a treatment for schizophrenia. Early on, J&J subsidiary Ortho developed the first prescription contraceptive gel. And in 1963, Ortho manufactured birth control pills called Ortho-Novum, which helped launch the birth-control pill revolution in the United States.
The Birth of an Iconic Pain Reliever
J&J acquired two key companies in 1959: Cilag Chemie in Europe and McNeil Laboratories in the United States. McNeil developed the first aspirin-free pain reliever, Tylenol Children’s Elixir.

Tylenol comes in various pill and capsule forms
A year later, the medication was available over the counter and became the most recommended pain reliever by pediatricians.
The next year, J&J marketed the drug to adults. By the 1980s, Tylenol was the leading pain-killer medication in the U.S. The drug remains one of J&J’s most iconic, recognizable brands. Its active ingredient, acetaminophen, is included in a number of over-the-counter and prescription medications.
Janssen, Ethicon and DePuy Orthopaedics
In 1961, J&J acquired Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which had begun as a small research laboratory in Belgium in 1953. Dr. Paul Janssen and his team discovered new medications to treat pain, help with mental illness, fight infection and treat digestive problems. Janssen is known as one of the most innovative and prolific researchers of the 20th century. His discoveries include Fentanyl (an anesthetic), Reasec (diarrhea treatment) and Haldol (schizophrenia) — which enabled patients to live at home rather than in an institution.


J&J’s subsidiaries Ethicon and DePuy Orthopaedics allowed the company to expand into surgical products and orthopedic implants.

Janssen Pharmaceuticals became J&J’s marketer and manufacturer of blockbuster prescription drugs including Invokana (canagliflozin) for Type 2 diabetes, Risperdal (risperidone) an antipsychotic and Xarelto (rivaroxiban) a blood thinner.
J&J started Ethicon as a suture business in 1949. One of Ethicon’s innovative products was a disposable skin stapler which allowed the company to enter the mechanical wound closure business. Throughout the 1990s, Ethicon developed minimally invasive surgery techniques, where small incisions allow patients to heal quicker. One of these tools for minimally invasive surgery — the power morcellator — helped surgeons perform complex surgeries with less blood loss and shorter recovery times.
DePuy Orthopaedics joined the long list of J&J subsidiaries in 1998 when the drug maker bought the medical device company for $3.5 billion. DePuy manufactures hip and knee implants and other medical devices.
Stents and HIV Treatment
Another surgical endeavor J&J invested in was the Palmaz-Schatz stent, the first coronary stent. Julio Palmaz designed the stent and sold the patent to J&J. J&J provided the funds to finish developing the idea and then market it. This new product kept vessels open to allow blood to reach the heart, and revolutionized cardiology.
J&J purchased Pfizer’s consumer health care unit in 2006, bringing in products such as Listerine for bad breath, Lubriderm for dry skin, Rogaine for hair loss, Bengay for sore muscles and more.
The company remains focused on global concerns such as HIV/AIDS. It acquired Tibotec-Virco BVBA, a company dedicated to helping people with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, in 2002.
The Tylenol Crisis
The Tylenol Crisis of 1982 was one of J&J’s most challenging recalls. It also provided a blueprint for future mass recalls. The company showed it was a master at reputation management in the face of bad publicity. In 1982, seven people in Chicago died after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol laced with cyanide. According to reports, an unknown suspect took the product from shelves, added cyanide and returned the products to the shelves.

Tylenol Recall
J&J recalled 31 million bottles of Tylenol at a loss of more than $100 million.

J&J immediately recalled 31 million bottles of Tylenol at a loss of more than $100 million, but never discovered who had tampered with the seven bottles.
Tylenol had 37 percent of the pain reliever market prior to the crisis. After, it fell to 7 percent. To recover from the massive blow to its reputation, J&J reintroduced Tylenol with tamper-resistant packaging, offered discounts and sent an army of more than 2,200 salespeople to doctors’ offices to restore confidence in the product. After J&J’s efforts, Tylenol regained most of its market share, climbing to 30 percent.
Then CEO James E. Burke got credit for leading the company through the crisis and restoring Tylenol’s reputation.
The Risperdal Controversy
J&J’s antipsychotic Risperdal (risperidone) made billions for the company. It also saddled them with thousands of lawsuits, including a criminal fine of $334 million for questionable marketing tactics. Documents revealed in lawsuits show how the company encouraged and incentivized its sales staff to illegally target doctors and clinics that treated children and the elderly — knowing that the drug could kill seniors and wasn’t proven safe or effective in children.

J&J created Risperdal to make up for Haldol’s loss of patent
It all began in 1986 when J&J’s profitable antipsychotic Haldol (haloperidol) lost patent. The company needed another multibillion-dollar blockbuster drug to replace its lost revenue. Risperdal was the answer. However, the FDA only approved the drug for use in schizophrenic adults — a very small part of the population. In order for the drug to be successful, millions of people would have to use it.
J&J knew it had to sell its drugs for additional uses to the elderly and children.
The drug giant wanted to market Risperdal as superior to Haldol and include comparisons on Risperdal’s drug label. The FDA disagreed. Dr. Robert Temple, an FDA clinical trial specialist, called the strategy unacceptable because it would lead “to the conclusion that Risperdal has been shown to be superior to [Haldol] when, in fact, it has not.”
The FDAs stance didn’t stop J&J from continuing to propose Risperdal for use in the elderly and children. The FDA continued to refuse to allow these uses on the drug’s label. In fact, Risperdal’s early clinical trials in children and the elderly found a high number of side effects, some serious — including an increased risk of stroke and heart-related problems in the elderly.
Selling Risperdal to Doctors and Nursing Homes
If J&J couldn’t get FDA approval, it would make its sales goal by using doctors to recommend it to their patients. While manufacturers cannot legally market a drug for off label — a use not approved by the FDA — doctors are allowed to prescribe a drug for any use.
Then Risperdal Sales Manager Alex Gorsky led the sales team and provided strategy to sell Risperdal. Gorsky is now the company’s CEO.





"We started looking hard for ways to go after these customers — pediatricians, nursing home doctors, mental health facilities, even school guidance counselors. We had to."- a former Janssen salesman told journalist Steven Brill




J&J began paying doctors in 1995 to push Risperdal and get it put on preferred Medicaid drug lists, and it worked. For example, in Texas, Medicaid spent $250 per patient with generic Haldol. After J&J pushed Risperdal in 1999, it spent $3,000 per patient.
Risperdal salespeople then went into nursing homes and the offices of pediatric psychiatrists. They paid millions of dollars in rebates and fees to Omnicare pharmacists in return for Risperdal sales to nursing homes. Salespeople incentivized doctors to prescribe Risperdal in exchange for paid speaking engagements.
They distributed literature saying that Risperdal was safe and effective for “treating hostility in the elderly.” The company also minimized any mention of side effects including a large number of deaths.
By the end of 2000, Risperdal made $1.08 billion a year for J&J. About half of the sales came from selling the drug to children and the elderly.
J&J Guilty of Misbranding Risperdal
For over a decade, J&J reaped the benefits of misbranding Risperdal, raking in billions.
In 2013, the Department of Justice ordered J&J to pay more than $2.2 billion “to resolve criminal and civil liability arising from allegations relating to the prescription drugs Risperdal, Invega and Natrecor, including promotion for uses not approved as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and payment of kickbacks to physicians and to the nation’s largest long-term care pharmacy provider.”
J&J’s Janssen unit “Janssen admitted that it promoted Risperdal to health care providers for treatment of psychotic symptoms and associated behavioral disturbances exhibited by elderly, non-schizophrenic dementia patients.”
It did not admit guilt in pushing the drug to children, but it agreed to pay fines associated with the charge.
The company also faces close to 17,000 lawsuits filed by the families of children who say the drug caused gynecomastia — female breast growth in boys.
J&J’s Problematic Drugs and Medical Devices
Risperdal wasn’t the only problematic J&J product. Among the millions of products Johnson & Johnson sold over the years, several pose a serious risk to consumers. In lawsuits, internal documents surfaced showing J&J and its subsidiaries knew about problems but sold the products anyway.
After reports of complications from consumers and physicians, the FDA, legal experts and patients themselves have taken action against J&J. The company faces more than 100,000 lawsuits for its defective products.






Hip Implants




DePuy, J&J’s medical device subsidiary, was one of the first device manufacturers to use a metal-on-metal hip design. It introduced the Pinnacle Hip Replacement System in 2000, the ASR Hip Resurfacing System (sold internationally) in 2003 and the ASR XL Acetabular System in 2005. DePuy Pinnacle systems have been used in up to 40,000 U.S. patients, as have 37,000 ASR products.
But the metal ball and cup components rub together and can release metal ions into the bloodstream, causing metallosis, or metal poisoning. Patients may also experience loosening of the implant or joint dislocation, and may require additional surgeries.
Because of problems with the implants and serious injuries to patients, the FDA investigated ASR and Pinnacle implants. DePuy recalled the ASR implants and discontinued the Pinnacle implants.

Transvaginal Mesh




In the late 1990s, Ethicon and several other device manufacturers introduced vaginal mesh implants. These products were designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI), conditions experienced by older women following menopause, childbirth or a hysterectomy. In 2010, nearly 300,000 U.S. women received a transvaginal mesh implant.
Many women experienced debilitating side effects from the implants, including perforation of organs, vaginal bleeding and scarring, mesh erosion and severe pain. Ethicon stopped manufacturing several of its mesh products in August 2012, including its Gynecare Prolift Kit, Gynecare Prolift + M Kit, Gynecare TVT Secure and Gynecare Prosima Pelvic Floor Repair System Kit.
Internal documents unsealed as a result of litigation in 2012 suggest J&J sold its Prolift+M mesh in 2007 without proper FDA clearance. In fact, the FDA requested J&J stop selling the device, but the company left it on the market. The FDA finally cleared the device in 2008, but it did not take corrective action against the device maker, Bloomberg reported.

Power Morcellators




Ethicon is one of a number of companies that manufactured power morellators. The devices used during hysterectomies and fibroid surgeries in women can cause hidden uterine cancer to spread. The result can be a rapid development of the disease, which can be deadly.
The FDA warned the morcellators could increase the development of cancer in women in 2014, and J&J pulled its devices from the market the same year. In early 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began an investigation into the company’s knowledge of the device’s risks.
The Government Accountability Office also began an investigation into the FDA’s clearance of the devices after members of Congress claimed the devices may have harmed thousands of women.

Invokana, Invokamet and Invokamet XR




Janssen developed the Type 2 diabetes drug Invokana, the first sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to receive FDA approval.
Approved in 2013, the FDA began noticing problems with Invokana in 2015. The agency warned SGLT2 inhibitors can cause a deadly condition called ketoacidosis in which the body produces dangerous acids called ketones.
The FDA has since issued several more safety communications for Invokana including a black box warning for an increased risk of foot and leg amputations.

J&J’s Multibillion-dollar Drug Pipeline
Legal worries and controversy has not slowed the drug giant. In May 2017, J&J announced it had 11 new drugs in its development pipeline with billion-dollar potential.
Some of the diseases these drugs could treat include depression, prostate cancer, solid tumors, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and influenza.
The drugmaker says the FDA has not yet approved these drugs, but they could be well on their way to megadrug status by 2021.

The Treatment That's Helping Transform the Lives of Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia









We are actively developing treatments for our patients in six important therapeutic areas: Cardiovascular & Metabolism, Immunology, Infectious Diseases & Vaccines, Neuroscience, Oncology and Pulmonary Hypertension.




Immunology
Our vision is a world free from immune diseases. To achieve this, we will translate internal and external science to deliver products that address immune-mediated diseases. 






We have a strong history of delivering novel medicines for immunological diseases. We continue to build a pipeline of innovative biologic and oral therapies in core disease areas: rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis. Through our ongoing efforts in discovery, biomarkers, clinical research and external innovation, we are poised for continued leadership and growth, bringing transformational medicines to patients and healthcare professionals around the world.

Our vision is a world free from immune diseases. To achieve this, we will translate internal and external science to deliver products that treat, cure, intercept, and prevent immune-mediated diseases.

— Sue Dillon,
Global Therapeutic Head, Immunology, Janssen



















Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease 
Our vision is to improve the lives of the millions of people with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and to work tirelessly to eliminate these diseases.






Every year, more than 19 million people around the world die from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This tremendous global burden compels us to develop new therapies that will change the face of these diseases with the goal to eliminate them. We focus on finding and developing truly transformational therapies that target underlying disease pathways, important pathways, and novel mechanisms of action. We continue to seek and develop the next generation of transformational cardiovascular & metabolic therapies. 
Visit the Janssen Website












Our deep scientific expertise and demonstrated clinical development capabilities support our commitment to aggressively develop and launch transformational therapies for patients with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

— James List, M.D., Ph.D.,
Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular & Metabolism



















Pulmonary Hypertension
For almost two decades, Actelion, a Janssen Pharmaceutical Company of Johnson & Johnson, has been working to fundamentally change the way pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is treated. 






Pulmonary hypertension refers to high blood vessel pressure in the lungs, and PAH is a rare, progressive form of this often-debilitating condition. While the disease affects more women than men, it can also develop in children of any age and across all ethnicities. About 15 people out of every million are affected by PAH. Our understanding of the complex pathways and molecular mechanisms of PAH has enabled us to develop tailored medicines to improve patient outcomes and make a difference for people around the world living with this disorder.

We are actively developing treatments for our patients in six important therapeutic areas, including Infectious Diseases & Vaccines, Neuroscience, and Oncology.




Infectious Diseases & Vaccines
We strive to discover and develop novel therapeutics and vaccines to treat and cure infectious diseases worldwide, improving treatment outcomes and patients’ lives. 






Our vision is to advance human health by helping to achieve a world free of life-threatening infectious diseases. We will do this by discovering and developing transformational therapies and vaccines that prevent, treat and cure some of the world’s most life-threatening infectious diseases such as HIV, viral hepatitis, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and Ebola.
Visit the Janssen Website




11
11 of our prescription medicines are on the World Health Organization’s list of Essential Medications.












Neuroscience
Our mission is to reduce the burden, disability and devastation caused by serious neuro psychiatric diseases and pain conditions. 






The research priorities of our Neuroscience Therapeutic Area include Alzheimer’s Disease, Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia. Across neuroscience, our researchers are exploring the emerging science of synaptic plasticity and cellular resilience, with an emphasis on developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of severe mood disorders and neurodegenerative dementias. We are deeply committed to patients with these conditions and to the health care professionals and loved ones who care for them.
Visit the Janssen Website












Janssen is leading efforts to discover and develop innovative therapeutic solutions for people with brain disorders and to eliminate the social stigma about these diseases.

— Husseini Manji, M.D., F.R.C.P.C.,
Global Therapeutic Area Head, Neuroscience



















Oncology
We envision a world where cancer is a preventable chronic or curable disease. To get there, we’re focused on developing solutions that prolong and improve patient lives. 






Cancer claims millions of lives every year and the number continues to rise. We aim to transform cancer to a preventable or curable disease by delivering diagnostic and therapeutic solutions that prolong and improve patients’ lives. We are committed to delivering targeted therapies to fight the devastation of cancer. 
Visit the Janssen Website












We envision a world where cancer is a preventable or curable disease. To get there, we're focusing on transformational science that will allow patients to live longer and better lives.

Easy to use, industrial-grade smart cameras with advanced machine vision technology






In Thailand, the consumer products market continues to remain solid due primarily to a high level of government support and strong exports.  In order to leverage this market most effectively, global manufacturing companies need to find new ways to increase productivity and lower production costs while still delivering the highest quality consumer goods.US-based Johnson & Johnson, is one of the world’s largest producers of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) such as: baby care products, consumer health care products (Modess and Carefree), beauty care products (Clean & Clear and Neutrogena) and many others.  In addition to China and India, Johnson & Johnson chose Thailand to be a regional manufacturing hub. The company’s factory is located in the Lad Krabang Industrial Estate Zone and employs more than 500 people.Johnson & Johnson has an impeccable reputation for quality assurance (QA) because it has put the strictest standard of quality control in at every stage of production process. The company has made significant investments in technology and factory management systems, production process management, work safety and health standards, environmental impact analysis, and socially responsible activities. Migration from sensor technology to vision sensor system and applications Prior to adopting a vision system in the production line, the company used an existing sensor system to check the completeness of material layers and other components of sanitary napkin products.  However, when additional product features are incorporated into new product designs, the existing sensor system cannot read the new release paper pattern and color properly.  The existing sensor system triggers the shut down signal which caused the machine to stop. Every time the operation staff needed to adjust the sensor position, it resulted in significant production downtime and unnecessary waste. In order to overcome this problem, Johnson & Johnson decided to upgrade their existing sensor system to a vision system that uses image capture technology. The goal with changing technologies was to reduce expenses associated with an incomplete production process and increase the production efficiency and effectiveness of the factory.  More importantly, Johnson & Johnson deployed a vision system to maintain the standards of every product the company makes.  According to Johnson & Johnson’s company slogan, “We never pass defect to customers.”Servo Dynamics Company Limited, a Cognex Automation Solution Provider (ASP) in Thailand provides advice, assistance and the best vision system solution for companies both before and after installation.  Prior to installation, Servo Dynamics recommended that Johnson & Johnson conduct a feasibility study and evaluate several vision systems products including Cognex. The study provided a comparison of the detailed attributes of each vision system in terms of efficiency, functions and features, valuation speed, communication options with factory network and other back-end systems, and price.  The Cognex vision system was tested and approved by the working team because it completely met Johnson & Johnson’s requirements in terms of features, reading rate speed, and ease of setting up the software application. Cognex was the only company that offered a complete line of machine vision products that support different requirements in each production line.  In the end, the main differentiator for Johnson & Johnson was the fact that Cognex has invested heavily in its research and development of machine vision technology.Johnson & Johnson selected several Cognex products to meet its vision system needs on the production lines, including:In-Sight® Micro 1100, which is used for inspecting finished products.  In order to ensure that every piece of product meets the high Johnson & Johnson standard, the In-Sight Micro 1100 provided the final inspection check prior to the product being packaged for shipping. In-Sight 5600, which is used to capture the inner and outer rim of sanitary napkin to check if the materials in each layer are complete and there are not any missing layers.Checker® 202, which is used for vision capture of the glue strip and is the tool that replaced the original sensor system. In-Sight 5110, which is used to read the barcode on the talcum powder can on the production line. Systems Integration: Great teamwork speeds up the processThe engineering team of Johnson & Johnson worked in conjunction with the experts from Servo Dynamics to study and plan the implementation and integration of the vision system into the factory system. At the beginning, addressing the inconsistent value caused by light from the LED screen in various positions was a significant barrier to successful installation. The Servo Dynamics team solved this problem by programming the In-Sight Explorer software to put an adjustment on the installation position and the alignment of light and color value through the control body of the programmable logic controller (PLC) and ensuring this functionality can be easily applied and conveniently configured.  The installation of the vision systems took only two months to complete.  To date, Cognex vision systems are installed in eight Modess sanitary napkin production lines and one production line of Care Free sanitary napkins. Vision systems are also being installed in all four production lines of baby talcum powder. Instant benefits gained right after the new vision system is operationalJohnson & Johnson has been successful in solving the problem of sensor error, reducing the production downtime rate to 0%, and reducing waste from machine ramp up.  In the first year alone, the cost savings from preventing machine shutdown and reducing waste was valued at USD 27,905.04.“In the past we had to use many Quality Assurance officers in random inspections of products at 15 minute intervals, including the operation officers who had to align the sensor system or electrical system manually.  With Cognex vision systems in place, these jobs are easy and convenient as they only need to control the value alignment and make any adjustment right from the monitor screen.” stated Mr. Jenwich Mitravijarn, Engineer Leader of Johnson & Johnson.          “Moreover we experienced that Cognex vision systems are easy to set up and configure even for a first time user.  As our business requirements keep changing over time, the variety of Cognex products cater to those changes and truly meet our specific needs well.  Another significant factor is Cognex’s before and after sale service. Cognex provides prompt support and expertise that helps us find the best solutions at each stage. This really gives us more confidence to invest in the future.”Looking ahead, Johnson & Johnson is considering extending the installation of vision systems in the production lines of other products to cope with the higher market demand. Maintaining a high quality products has been, and continues to be, Johnson & Johnson’s first priority.About Johnson & JohnsonCaring for the world, one person at a time… inspires and unites the people of Johnson & Johnson.  We embrace research and science—bringing innovative ideas, products and services to advance the health and well-being of people. Our approximately 114,000 employees at more than 250 Johnson & Johnson companies work with partners in health care to touch the lives of over a billion people every day throughout the world.
