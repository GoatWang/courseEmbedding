Guernsey launches Manager Led Product (“MLP”)
31/05/2016
Guernsey has recently launched the MLP which in essence removes repeated regulatory requirements across associated parties in structures set up by an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”).  The regulations will only be for the AIFM and this will allow the quick and efficient launch of new Funds in Guernsey with established AIFMs able to launch new Funds by notification only to the Guernsey Financial Services Commission.
