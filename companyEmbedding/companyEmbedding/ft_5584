                    If you have been thinking about upgrading to a larger home or a different neighborhood but have been putting it off until the real estate market improves then it may be time to bite the bullet. The bull market is back in Ocala, but who knows for how long. Low inventory of homes for sale coupled with increasing buyer demand has created a seller's market once again. Even new construction has resumed, a tell tale sign that prices are up. Don't be fooled though, the market is not back to its record highs, but prices are up and houses are selling within days of being listed and frequently with multiple offers. This is fantastic news for the Ocala real estate market and for your if you are thinking about selling your home. The first step is to contact a local realtor who can perform a comparative market analysis of your home's value so that you know what to expect going forward. Don't let the seller's market pass you by. Seize the opportunity to sell your home today.
