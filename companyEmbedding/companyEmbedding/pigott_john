But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in MS, I'd be happy to help.Learn More 5 Tips for Insurance Shopping OnlineThe choices you make when selecting insurance coverages, limits and deductibles can affect what you'll pay for a policy. Learn about what to expect when you're shopping for car insurance online.Learn More What Is Renters Insurance?Renting a home can be great, particularly if you don't have to worry about regular maintenance and upkeep. But you, and your stuff, are still at risk — from things such as a fire, theft or a guest getting injured. Having renters insurance in place can help protect you and your belongings. Whether it's helping you replace stolen items, paying for damage that you caused to a neighbor's window or paying for a hotel if you can't live in your home because of a covered loss, renters insurance may help when the unexpected happens.Learn More Life Insurance CalculatorBuying life insurance is a very important decision, but I know it's one that can also be overwhelming — especially when it comes to figuring out how much you might want. You may want to consider things like your family's future expenses, income and life events, as well as the length and type of policy you are purchasing. It's a lot to think about, but this calculator is a great place to start. And once you get your results, I'm here to talk more in-depth as you choose the policy that may work best for you.Learn More Small Business Insurance NeedsYou know the ins and outs of your small business and what it takes to keep things running. But do you know how to help protect the business you've worked so hard to build? From merchandise to machinery to a home-based operation, there are a lot of coverage options available to choose from. This quick rundown of things you'll want to consider when insuring your small business is a great place to start. I know the effort a small business takes, and I'm here to help you protect your life's work.Learn More What is Event Liability Insurance?Whether it's a wedding, a sweet 16, a golden anniversary or a baby shower, life's milestones often come with a celebration. You've probably spent a lot of time planning every detail for your special event, but sometimes things happen that you just can't predict. For instance, what if you or your guests damage a reception hall or accidentally injure someone during the event? Learn how event liability insurance may help if your event doesn't go exactly as planned.Learn More Safety Vs. StyleThe choice between stylish riding gear and truly protective gear should be easy - whatever makes it more likely you'll walk away from an accident safely. Thankfully there is a lot of gear that is both safe and stylish these days. And while I certainly hope you're never in an accident, choosing your protective wear wisely can make a big different if you are. From helmet guidelines to leather jackets to armor, here are some helpful tips on choosing the right gear for your ride.Learn More Condo InsuranceYou found the perfect condominium, called about the utilities and have movers lined up. But before you move in, do you have the right coverage for your new home? Condos are unique in the way they are insured - both you and the condo association need policies. From common areas to personal property, it's important that you understand what your policy covers and what your condo association's insurance may help protect. Take a look at this overview of condominium insurance, and then let's make sure you have the coverage you need.Learn More Have Policy Questions? I Can Help!Whether you're moving, test driving a car or considering buying life insurance, an agent's expertise may come in handy. Certain life events and policy questions are best addressed with an insurance agent consultation.Learn More What's Umbrella Insurance?You have insurance to help protect your home and car, but what happens in situations where your standard insurance coverage is not enough? That's when a personal umbrella insurance policy (PUP) could help. If you're found legally responsible for damages resulting from an accident or if you're sued, a PUP may help prevent you from paying out of pocket for costs that exceed the limits of your homeowners or auto insurance. A PUP from Allstate may help cover attorney costs and lost wages, even if you're out of the country. If you're interested in increasing your protection, I'd be happy to talk to you about umbrella coverage today.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Picayune.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(601) 798-7005(601) 798-7005Fax(601) 798-7636(601) 798-7636Email:johnpigott@allstate.comjohnpigott@allstate.comAddress:915 Highway 43 NPicayune, MS 39466Get DirectionsLandmarks:I mile west of Exit 6, off of I-59..or 100 yards east of intersection of Hwy 11 and Hwy 43 North... between Coldwell Banker and Formby RealtyAreas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Picayune, MS, Carriere, MS, Poplarville, MS.

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in MS, I'd be happy to help.Learn More What Is Comprehensive Auto Insurance?When you hear the word "comprehensive," you might think "all-encompassing." But when it comes to insurance, the word has a different meaning. Simply put, comprehensive coverage helps protect you against damage to your car that is not the result of a collision - such as theft or a fallen tree branch. I'd be happy to talk to you about whether comprehensive coverage makes sense for you.Learn More Comparing Renters Insurance QuotesWhen comparing renters insurance quotes from different insurers, it's important to take more than price into consideration. Understanding what the policy covers and making sure it fits your needs may help give you the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have certain protections in place while you're living in a rented home or apartment.Learn More What Is An Annuity?Thanks to healthier living and great medical care, more people are living longer. Hopefully that means a longer retirement. But that prolonged retirement means you'll need to make your money last longer. One way of doing that is by investing in an annuity, which may provide you with regular income during your golden years. From tax deferred income to a lifetime income, annuities can offer some great benefits and may provide financial security during your retirement.Learn More Is Your Office Rental Covered?Renting an office for your business makes sense - you have the space you need without the costs or maintenance of owning the building. But relying on the landlord's insurance to cover your business if a fire or break-in should occur is not a savvy decision. The landlord's policy typically covers the building but not your company's equipment or the business if there is an accident in the office. Whether it's making sure your computers would be replaced or recouping potential losses after a disaster, let's talk about insuring your business before you sign that lease.Learn More Safety Vs. StyleThe choice between stylish riding gear and truly protective gear should be easy - whatever makes it more likely you'll walk away from an accident safely. Thankfully there is a lot of gear that is both safe and stylish these days. And while I certainly hope you're never in an accident, choosing your protective wear wisely can make a big different if you are. From helmet guidelines to leather jackets to armor, here are some helpful tips on choosing the right gear for your ride.Learn More Fire Damage To Your CondoLiving in a condominium has its perks, especially if the condo board manages upkeep of the building. But you're still at risk when things go wrong in common areas or neighboring units, especially when it comes to a fire. The damage can be hard enough to deal with, but you could also be left wondering whose insurance will cover the costs of repairs and replacing your belongings. While you hopefully never experience a fire in or near your condo, it is important to be familiar with not only your condo insurance's fire coverage but also with the association's coverage.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it.

Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Poplarville.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you.
