Pradux Privacy Policy



Effective as of February 2013
We at Pradux, Inc. ("Pradux," "we," "us," or "our") have created this privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Pradux in connection with our online services, which are made available to you through our website located at http://www.pradux.com (the "Website").
By visiting our Website, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service.
The Information We Collect
The information we collect is categorized as follows:

Application Information – information that you provide to us through our Website and through other means.  Examples include your physical address, zip code and phone number.
Transaction and Experience Information – information about your transactions with us, as well as information about our communications to you.  Examples include your account history, requests for information and responses.
Information provided via Facebook Connect.

We need this information to provide you (and to authorize our retail partners and affiliates to provide you) goods and services that you request and to let you know of additional goods and services about which you might be interested.  We also use this information to customize your experience using our website.
We may share the information we collect about with third parties from one or more of the following categories:

Retailers
Credit Card Companies
Advertisers

We may ask you for personally identifying information at other times, such as if you enter a promotion, communicate with us or complete a survey. If you opt-in to receive information regarding a promotion, you give us permission to share your name and e-mail address with the third party offering the promotion.
In addition, we automatically gather general statistical information about our Website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, e-mail address, home address, or telephone number.  We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our Website, so we can improve our Website.  We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so we do not provide personally identifying information without your permission.
The Way We Use Information
We use personally identifying information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Website’s content, layout and services.
We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions.  You can opt-out of receiving this information by emailing help@pradux.com. We may ask that you provide us voluntarily with additional information regarding your personal or business interests, experience or requests, which may be used to customize our service for you.
We use your e-mail address, your mailing address, and phone number to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications relevant to your use of the Website. You can opt out of receiving such contact by emailing help@pradux.com.
If you place a request for products or services, we use information to ship your order; if a product or service is from a retail partner or affiliate, we may provide your  relevant information to that retailer for purposes of the transaction.  If you establish a credit card account with us or our providers or affiliates, we collect additional information, including billing information, credit card number and expiration date and tracking information from checks or money orders.
We may also use or disclose information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Service.  We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or it we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service or improve our products or services.
We may, from time to time, share your information with other companies who may provide you information about the products and services they offer. However, to the extent required by law, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of such sharing.
We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include processing orders and providing marketing assistance, information technology support, and customer service. These other companies will have access to your information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.
We may share some or all of your information with any of our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage our website and to enhance our site based on the usage pattern data we receive.
Word of warning: If you post private information to any public forum, blog, public profile, or other public area of the site, all that information can be viewed by the public. You agree that Pradux shall not be responsible for the public's sharing of this information once you make it public via these or other methods.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who have an established business relationship with Pradux may choose to opt out of our sharing your personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and (1) you wish to opt out; or (2) you wish to request certain information regarding our disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for the direct marketing purposes, please send and e-mail to help@pradux.com or write us at:
Pradux, Inc.
    P.O. Box 1955
    Hoboken, NJ 07030
Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pradux uses cookies to help Pradux identify and track visitors, their usage of Pradux website, and their website access preferences. Pradux visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Pradux's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Pradux's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Security
We employ commercially reasonable security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information.
Your account information and profile are password protected.  We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail.  Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session.  This is to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place where others may have access to it.
Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online --- for example on message boards, through e-mail or in chat areas --- that information can be collected and used by others.  No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure.  As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
Children Under 13
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age or 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use or register to use our website. However, we have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our website, and so we carry the same privacy policy for individuals of all ages.  If a child has provided us with personally identifying information without consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information and opt out of any promotional opportunities.
Business Transfers
If Pradux, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pradux goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Pradux may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
Ads
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  The privacy policy of an advertiser or promotional service appearing on our site may differ from ours.  We encourage you to read that policy before responding to the offer.
Links
Our website contains links to other sites. In fairness, and as a matter of law, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or content of those other sites. That means, if privacy is a concern for you, and it should be, you should read the other site's privacy policy to make sure you are comfortable with it. What you are reading here and now, only applies to Pradux.
IMPORTANT NOTICE TO NON-U.S. RESIDENTS
The Website and its servers are all operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us and/or that we collect from you will be transferred to, processed, and used in the United States in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. By using the Website and/or providing us with any information, you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to such transfer, processing, and use in the United States.
Privacy Policy Changes
Pradux may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Pradux's sole discretion. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be communicated through our Website. By accessing the Website after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please refer back to this Policy on a regular basis.
