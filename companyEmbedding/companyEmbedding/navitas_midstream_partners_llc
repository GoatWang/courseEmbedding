THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Sept. 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC ("Navitas") announced today that it has acquired natural gas gathering and processing assets serving Martin, Midland and Glasscock counties in Texas from a subsidiary of Denver-based DCP Midstream, LLC.
The assets acquired include approximately 1,000 miles of low and high pressure natural gas gathering pipelines and a cryogenic processing plant, which has capacity in excess of 60 million cubic feet per day.
"We are excited to acquire such an extensive footprint, which is in the core of the Midland Basin and will provide the foundation for additional growth opportunities," said R.

THE WOODLANDS, Texas, May 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC ("Navitas") announced today the execution of a long-term gas purchase agreement with Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. ("Encana"). Under the agreement, Navitas will purchase Encana's gas from its substantial acreage position in Howard County, Texas.  Navitas will gather gas into a new system consisting of low-pressure gathering lines, multiple compressor stations and a 38-mile, 16-inch high-pressure pipeline, providing fully integrated services for both natural gas and natural gas liquids.








Navitas also announced plans to construct new cryogenic processing capacity near its existing Spraberry processing complex to accommodate Encana and other producers' gas from Howard, Glasscock, Martin, Midland and Upton Counties.  The new processing facilities will increase Navitas's combined processing capacity in the Midland Basin to approximately 155 MMcf per day and will have carbon dioxide treating and nitrogen rejection capabilities.  In addition to new gathering and processing facilities, Navitas will be looping a significant portion of its existing Spraberry system mainline with a new 20-inch high-pressure pipeline.  The entire project is expected to be completed early second quarter of 2017.
"Encana has accumulated a tremendous acreage position in western Howard County, and we are pleased to have been selected to work with them in this exciting area," said R. Bruce Northcutt, Chief Executive Officer of Navitas.  "We have seen tremendous well results from the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations in western Howard County, and our new infrastructure and producer-focused midstream services will bring competitive advantages to oil and gas operators in the area."
In addition to the announced expansion projects, Navitas continues installation of new, highly efficient field compression.  These upgrades are part of Navitas's continued focus on improving operating run-times, reducing losses and improving overall efficiencies of its facilities to the benefit of producers.

Acquisition from DCP gives Navitas Midstream large footprint in Midland Basin

1 / 1


Back to Gallery









  In one quick acquisition, Navitas Midstream Partners LLC has established a major foothold in the Midland Basin.
  Based in the Woodlands, Navitas has acquired natural gas gathering and processing assets from a subsidiary of DCP Midstream LLC. These assets, serving Martin, Midland and Glasscock counties, include approximately 1,000 miles of low- and high-pressure natural gas gathering pipelines and a cryogenic processing plant with capacity of more than 60 million cubic feet per day.
  “This is a foundational acquisition for Navitas,” said Bruce Northcutt, founder and chief executive officer of the company. The 18-month-old company, which has a small pipeline in Southeast Texas, had been looking at a variety of plays for its first major acquisition.
  He said the new assets are in an area that has “great rock, great rock quality.” “The Permian Basin is a pretty vast area and inside the Permian you have the south and north Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin. We looked at opportunities in both basins and this resulted in our first acquisition,” Northcutt said.
  “We’re very excited to be in Midland,” said Will Byers, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Northcutt and his team have experience in the region.
  “Navitas may be a new name to the Permian Basin, but the company and its individuals are familiar with the Permian Basin,” Northcutt said.
  The company is also familiar with the economic cycles of the industry, and midstream operations will continue to play an important role despite current oil price levels, he said.
  The company has established a Midland office and plans to add to its local workforce, he said. Some former DCP employees joined the company after the acquisition, he said.
  Other plans include an extensive capital program to improve the system’s capacity and efficiency.
  “We have capital to spend and plan to spend it on these assets for reliability, safety and future expansion as well,” he said. “Work on the assets has begun; we’ve got people on the ground, we’ve hired some contractors,” he said.
  He is especially excited to have the support of corporate partner Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm that has more than $35 billion in assets under management, including a $4 billion energy fund that invested more than $50 billion in 720 companies in more than 35 countries.
  Northcutt praised Warburg Pincus as a long-term, patient partner.  
  “We plan to be good community neighbors, work to grow our business and be a valuable asset to operators,” he said.
