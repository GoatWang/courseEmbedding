      Public Company Information:          




NYSE:MON 







  "It was clear to me and the Board that of all of the candidates,        Pierre's financial skill and leadership capability was the right        combination for our business" 




      The Board of Directors of Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) today announced 
      that Pierre Courduroux, 45, will be appointed as the company's new 
      Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective on Jan. 1, 
      2011. Courduroux currently serves as Monsanto's finance lead for its 
      global business operations.
    

      "For more than 20 years, Pierre has been a valuable asset to Monsanto 
      and our finance organization," said Hugh Grant, chairman, president and 
      chief executive officer of Monsanto. "Pierre understands our business, 
      has proven financial expertise, and applies that to executing on our 
      strategic vision. His leadership will provide a key anchor as Monsanto 
      focuses on the operational implementation that will drive the growth in 
      this company over the long term."
    

      A native of Clermont-Ferrand, France, Courduroux joined the former 
      Monsanto Company in 1990. During his career, Courduroux has served in a 
      variety of leadership positions throughout Monsanto's finance 
      organization and across its global operating businesses.
    

      "It was clear to me and the Board that of all of the candidates, 
      Pierre's financial skill and leadership capability was the right 
      combination for our business," said Grant. "Monsanto will benefit from 
      his global business experience and financial insight."
    

      Courduroux recently assumed responsibility for the global finance 
      organization across the company's crop protection and seeds-and-traits 
      divisions. In this role, he also was responsible for establishing 
      processes in conjunction with the controller's function, treasury, tax, 
      Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, risk management and investment decisions for 
      the world's leading agriculture business.
    

      Prior to this role, he served as the Chief Financial Officer for 
      Monsanto's global vegetable business, where he was instrumental in the 
      acquisition of the De Ruiter Seeds business. He also has served in 
      senior finance positions within the areas of corporate strategy, 
      corporate planning, controllership, as well as business operations in 
      Europe and Africa.
    

      Courduroux holds a business degree with a major in finance from the 
      Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Lyon, which is located in Lyon, France. 
      He also holds an Executive Masters of Business Administration from 
      Washington University in St. Louis. Courduroux and his family live in 
      St. Louis.
