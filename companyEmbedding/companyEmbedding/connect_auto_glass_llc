"Windshield damage should be fixed as soon as possible. Most 'dings' or 'chips' can be repaired if the damage is not in the driver's line of vision and is smaller than the size of a silver dollar, including any cracks. If the break is larger than the silver dollar, or in the driver's line of vision, replacement is recommended. ALL STAR GLASS provides both services for your convenience."

"Windshield damage should be fixed as soon as possible. Most 'dings' or 'chips' can be repaired if the damage is not in the driver's line of vision and is smaller than the size of a silver dollar, including any cracks. If the break is larger than the silver dollar, or in the driver's line of vision, replacement is recommended. ALL STAR GLASS provides both services for your convenience."
