2017


Spring Commentary – 2017
April, 2017


The Markets The surging equity market that had been riding a wave of investor enthusiasm following Donald Trump’s election as US president abated somewhat towards the end of the first quarter. Stocks rose based on the expectation that Trump’s electoral victory would usher in a Reagan-like era of rampant deregulation, fiscal stimulus in the form…  Continued





Winter Commentary – 2017
January, 2017


The Markets The New Year usually begins with hope and enthusiasm, especially when the occupant of the presidential suite is changing. This year has a qualitatively different feeling due to extreme uncertainty in the air. The US stock market’s year-end rally was impressive and mostly unexpected. Financial companies in particular skyrocketed due to the assumption…  Continued


2016


Fall Commentary – 2016
October, 2016


The Markets Stocks ended the third quarter up 3.3% which was unexpected, given the bad news about Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest financial institution and uncertainty over when the Fed will raise interest rates. More importantly, investors have shrugged off diminished corporate earnings, which are expected to drop 2.1% from a year earlier. The profitability of…  Continued





Summer Commentary – 2016
July, 2016


The Markets Investors were subjected to quite a shock at the end of the 2nd quarter, as US stocks rallied immediately after a precipitous decline due to the UK’s vote to exit from the European Union.  The Dow Jones industrial average has already recovered, almost to where it was before the vote, and remains in…  Continued





Spring Commentary – 2016
April, 2016


The Markets Major stock indexes gained about 13% since mid-February and are finally in positive territory after a steep drop earlier in the year. US stocks ended slightly ahead for the first three months of 2016, mostly due to a recovery in oil prices and continued easing on the part of central banks. The US…  Continued





Winter commentary – 2016
January, 2016


The Markets 2015 marked the worst year for the US stock market since 2008. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 2.2% while the broader base Standard & Poor’s 500 fell 0.7%. The technology index, known as the NASDAQ, gained 5.7%, primarily because a few stocks, Netflix and Amazon, rose spectacularly during the year. Most asset…  Continued


2015


Fall Commentary – 2015
October, 2015


The Markets During the third quarter of the year, investors experienced the largest percentage declines for US stock market indexes and the most volatility since 2011. We expect this roller coaster ride to continue because international and US corporate earnings will likely decline for the second quarter in a row, harkening back to the contracting…  Continued





Summer Commentary – 2015
July, 2015


The Markets The second quarter of 2015 exhibited a shift in performance as stocks fell to the point where year-to-date returns are minimal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.14% while the more forward-looking Dow Transportation Average is down 11.46%. High dividend paying utilities have declined 10.96% so far this year. The technology laden…  Continued





Spring Commentary – 2015
April, 2015


The Markets Easy money policies from central banks around the world and the lack of political unrest in the developed world helped support stock prices during the first quarter of 2015 as several indexes moved to new highs in the US, England, and Germany.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 rose 4/10 of 1% during the…  Continued





Winter Commentary – 2015
January, 2015


The Markets The US experienced close to the best of all macro-economic conditions for stocks which served to propel the market to unprecedented highs in 2014. The Federal Reserve and other central banks continued to pump money into the world’s major economies and this helped, along with the falling price of oil during the last…  Continued

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
