This startup wants to fix a major problem with the highly unregulated supplements industry

  Let's face it: Most supplements are a little bit sketchy. It's
  not just that many of them don't
  actually contain what they say they do — the
  science on their alleged benefits is also mixed
  at best.


  But a startup called Elysium Health is trying to
  change that with a new kind of supplement. The company
  is the brainchild of former Sequoia partner Eric Marcotulli,
  former JPMorgan vice president Dan Alminana, and MIT
  professor Leonard Guarente.


  The team emphasizes, first, that their products contain
  what they're supposed to (that is to say, no extra materials that
  have nothing to do with the supplement), and
  second, are tested for safety and efficacy.


  The company focuses on supplements, which
  traditionally can include everything from your
  daily multivitamin to the bottles of unpronouncable
  ingredients lining the shelves of your local health food
  store. Since they aren't designed to treat a specific
  disease or ailment, they typically aren't regulated in
  the same way as pharmaceutical drugs.


  Business Insider sat down with the New York-based Elysium team,
  which is now a little more than a year into producing
  its first product, to learn more about their plans.


  The goal: Improve cell health


  Elysium's first product is called Basis. It aims to
  boost the levels of a specific protein called
  "nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide" (NAD), found in cells. Some
  studies in mice and
  
  yeast suggest that boosting NAD levels may help
  prevent aging-related decay in important structures in our cells
  called mitochondria. 


  "NAD governs communication between the nucleus and everything
  else in the cell, as well as how the cells communicate with one
  another," said Marcotulli. As we age and NAD levels fall, "the
  ability to communicate appropriately also drops." In other words,
  it's like being on the end of a choppy phone line; the less you
  can hear, the more likely something will get lost in translation
  and go awry.


  There haven't been any studies of Basis and NAD in people
  just yet, but Elysium is currently recruiting volunteers for a
  human trial.


  Marcotulli and Alminana heard about the possibility to work with
  NAD through Guarente, who's been studying
  aging and NAD in particular in his lab at MIT.


  Back in 2000, Guarente 
  wrote a paper which concluded that NAD helped
  power special proteins called sirtuins.


  "For 20 years or more we'd been studying proteins called
  sirtuins," he told Business Insider. He wanted to see
  how these proteins potentially affected aging and
  overall health. "Along the way, different kinds of natural
  products had appeared, which could affect the activity of these
  sirtuins."

  Guarente and his research team ultimately decided on two
  naturally occurring compounds. The first
  was pterostilbene, a type of
  micronutrient called a polyphenol that's present in
  tiny amounts in almonds, grape leaves, and blueberries. The
  second was nicotinamide
riboside, a form of vitamin B3 that's also found
  in trace amounts in yeast-containing foods and milk-derived
  products like cheese and yogurt.


  Elysium hopes that by combining these compounds
  and providing them in larger quantities than the trace
  amounts found in food, they could help the body make
  NAD. 


  Although some research on pterostilibene and nicotinamide
  riboside has already been conducted, showing everything from
  their bioavailability (their
  ability to be absorbed by the body) and safety to some
  potential anti-aging
  qualities (at least in rats), Elysium still has to show that
  their formulation also has all of these qualities. For that,
  they are conducting a study with the primary goal of
  examining NAD levels in the blood. If the supplement is
  successful, the amount of NAD should be higher in people taking
  it regularly than in the people taking a placebo.


  The trial for Basis is forthcoming and the study is currently
  recruiting, according to 
  ClinicalTrials.gov.


  The first year


  Basis costs about $50 per month if you choose to pay as you go,
  while a one-time bottle will set you back $60. You can also
  subscribe for a half or full year, which costs $45 or $40 per
  month, respectively.


  At about a year into their development, Marcotulli said
  Elysium's customers are in the "tens of
  thousands."Marcotulli said they've retained about a third of
  the customers who've been with them since February 2015,
  when they launched Basis. The groups of people sticking with
  Basis who started a few months later are even larger, he
  said, because Elysium sold out for about 10 weeks toward the
  beginning, which he said probably turned a fair number of people
  off of the product. 


  Elysium is testing five more products and plans to
  investigate others focused on improved overall health and
  wellness.


  "The concept of the company is that there are a lot of natural
  products out there," Guarante said. "We want to be able to
  recognize when there's something that's discovered in medical
  research that has the potential for benefiting human health, and
  make that available as quickly as possible in a way that's safe."

Elysium Health BASIS Review
Elysium Health is an anti-aging supplement manufacturer which recently released a pill called BASIS. BASIS claims to turn back the signs of aging by literally repairing your DNA.
Normally, this is the part where people click away, thinking Elysium Health is another anti-aging supplement scam.
But it’s not: Elysium Health is a legitimate company founded by one of the world’s leading anti-aging researchers. Oh, and he’s being advised by five Nobel Prize winners.
Yes, Elysium Health’s BASIS is an anti-aging supplement based on real science from legitimate researchers. Find out how this new anti-aging company works today in our Elysium Health BASIS review.

What is Elysium Health?
At the official Elysium Health website, the company describes itself as having one mission:
“To help people access, understand and benefit from scientific breakthroughs in health.”
To back up that goal, the company supports four distinct values: Transparency, Access, Progress, and Validation. Basically, Elysium Health wants to give average people like you and me an honest glimpse into modern anti-aging technology with no hype, no fads, and no shady ingredients.
Of course, even the shady supplement companies say stuff like this, so here’s more validation for you: the company was created in Silicon Valley by two gym buddies who saw an emerging opportunity in anti-aging supplements.
Those two gym buddies – cofounders Eric Marcotulli and Dan Alminana – knew that they didn’t have the scientific background to build such a company. They were tech investors, not biologists. So they started calling anti-aging researchers across the United States.
That’s when MIT biologist Leonard Guarente picked up the phone and expressed interest. And he wasn’t alone: five Nobel Prize winners also jumped on as advisors along with over 20 other top researchers in their fields.
That’s why people are paying attention to what Elysium Health is selling.
What is Elysium Health Selling?
Elysium Health just released its first product. It’s called BASIS – or BASIS in the official marketing. It’s a simple softgel tablet which costs $60 for a one month supply (or $50 per month on the subscription program).



Each package contains 60 capsules. You take two capsules per day to achieve the full benefits.
How Does Elysium Health BASIS Work?
This new supplement is based on work that was pioneered in Guarente’s lab. Specifically, Guarente studied sirtuins, a group of enzymes which play a critical role in cell metabolism and energy production.
All living organisms have these sirtuins inside their body.
Here’s the interesting thing about sirtuins: scientists have shown that by boosting the activity of sirtuins, they can extend the lifespans of worms, mice, yeasts, and other living creatures.
For the past two decades, scientists have been trying to develop drugs that elevate sirtuins. There are also two known natural compounds which boost sirtuins activity: resveratrol – found in red wine and sold as a dietary supplement – and NAD.
NAD stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and it’s one of the biggest anti-aging discoveries of the last decade. Research has shown that NAD levels are directly correlated to aging: an old man will have about half the NAD levels as his body did when he was young – regardless of exercise, healthy eating, or disease.
You may have already heard about NAD. In December 2013, Harvard researchers published a study describing how they made the cells of 2 year old mice look like the cells of 6 month old mice simply by “administering a molecule naturally produced by the human body”. That molecule was NAD.
Whew, so given all that information, how exactly does BASIS work?
BASIS contains two building blocks for NAD: it gives your body the tools it needs to produce NAD on its own. Yes, there are just two ingredients needed to stimulate NAD levels in the body. Those ingredients are:
— Nicotinamide Riboside (250mg)
— Pterostilbene (50mg)
These two ingredients are absorbed by the body and ultimately transform into NAD. Then, that NAD goes to work performing critical tasks throughout the body, including:
— DNA repair
— Energy production
— Cellular detoxification
— Protein function
All of these functions lead to powerful anti-aging, health-boosting benefits.

Elysium Health BASIS Ingredients
Up above, I mentioned that there were two active ingredients in BASIS. In addition to nicotinamide riboside and Pterostilbene, there are a number of other ingredients. Here’s the complete ingredient list as posted on the Elysium Health website:

But BASIS Doesn’t Call Itself an Anti-Aging Supplement
The funny thing about Elysium Health BASIS is that it’s not calling itself an anti-aging supplement manufacturer. Despite enlisting the nation’s top anti-aging researchers as advisors, Elysium Health is calling itself a dietary supplement company.
In a recent interview, Elysium Health cofounder Marcotulli said, “We have no interest in being an anti-aging company and extending lifespan. For us this is about increasing healthspan, not lifespan.”
Why? The founders wanted to avoid the “charlatan feel” of the countless other anti-aging supplements on the market today. Too many low-quality manufacturers claim they’ve found the secret to turning back the clock and reverse the effects of aging – despite having no scientific evidence to back it up.
Elysium Health wanted to stay far, far away from the problematic reputations of these companies. That’s why it’s advertising itself as more of a health and wellness company than an anti-aging company.
Future Elysium Health Products
Elysium Health has ambitious plans for the future. America’s population is getting older – as are the populations of most developed countries.
That’s why the opportunity for future products is just going to get larger. Here are some of the products and targeted areas Elysium Health has suggested may be in its future lineup:
— Brain health
— Musculoskeletal health
These new products are expected to tap into the network of “more than 30 scientific advisors” currently signed on to the company.
How to Buy Elysium Health BASIS
Elysium Health doesn’t plan on releasing its products anywhere but the official website. Once again, this is a strategic decision by the company designed to protect the Elysium Health brand: you can walk into Whole Foods and see dozens of faceless pharmaceutical companies selling their own anti-aging tonic. Elysium doesn’t want to be like that.
Ordering from Elysium Health is easy (especially since they only have one product, BASIS, in their current online store).
There are two ways to buy BASIS:
— One Time ($60)
— Monthly ($50)
Both of those prices include shipping. If you buy the monthly subscription of BASIS, you’ll receive a shipment of BASIS in your mailbox along with a $50 charge on your credit card every month.
How to Use Elysium Health BASIS
BASIS comes in packages of 60 softgel tablets. Each “serving” includes 2 softgels.
Elysium Health recommends taking two softgel tablets per day or as recommended by your health care professional.
It only recommends BASIS for healthy adults 18 years of age or older. It also recommends talking to a health care professional before beginning treatment.

I took Basis for one solid year without missing days. I found zero difference other than feeling sleepy at times which I am not certain is related to this product. I think that it has a great marketing plan and I am certain people are gaining profits from all of the hype. I did not find this to do anything for me and feel suspicious of the way it is being promoted by a bunch of old dudes making it their last ditch effort to make a ton of cash before hanging it up. Do some research on the backers of this and it does not offer comfort.

I’m 47, don’t exercise, sit behind a computer all day and have had very bad eating habits for the past 10 yrs. I was in a horrible relationship for those past 10 yrs . Now that I’ve been out the relationship ( 6 mos) I’ve focused on getting healthy.
I did get multi-nutrient testing done by spectracell 10/16 as well as magnesium rbc testing via requestatest.com to seek some ground truth as to what was going with my health.
The testing basically confirmed that i was in poor health … deficiencies in Mg RBC ( so low I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and a few ER visits ) , Vitamin E, inositol and cytesine. And most of my anti-oxidant levels were borderline .
I did my research as well as reviewed the summaries of the chromadex and elysium studies . I’m put off that they’ve not released the actual papers to date. I’ve read nih.gov research papers on magnesium supplements as well as listened to anyone I could deem somewhat credible on youtube ( ER doctor , etc ) about magnesium as well as NAD/basis/NR/NMN and NAD via IV therapy.
I took this for the first time today and had immediate improvements in energy levels 1 hour after two capsules. My enery levels were to the point almost of euphoria . I’ve not felt this good since I was in the military ( and in much better shape ) . For me, as I type this, the results are astounding! I’ve not taken any other supplements for the past 48 hours due to some stress testing my (new) dr wants me to get.
My takeaway from all of the above comments is that it appears that the older and more out of shape you are the larger and more immediate the impact and results. For those that felt nothing , I would wonder if they are under 40 and workout as it appears the already young and mostly healthy would not benefit as much.
However, for me this thing has been a freaking miracle!!
In addition to taking supplements to get my deficient levels back to where they should be I’ll continue to take basis as well. I’ll do testing again in 6 months to see where my levels are and perhaps post back results. Though I’m not sure how I would quantify NAD results other than my subjective comments about how my body feels.
Thanks

I have been taking BASIS for 5 weeks now. I can’t say for certain if I notice anything or not – some days I seem to have more energy, some days I don’t, some days I seem to sleep better, some days I don’t. I read a comment on another site where the person summarized what he had read from other comments – it seems that people experience more dramatic results if you are older, overweight and don’t exercise much; whereas people that are younger, in shape and exercise regularly seem to notice less results. This is just an observation. People that are in better shape supposedly start to notice some results later on (2-3 months)
As has been mentioned numerous times – BASIS is more of a maintenance supplement and is not designed to boost your performance.
I plan on giving BASIS a good 6 months to a year to determine if I notice any benefits. From my perspective – worst case it doesn’t do anything, best case it improves the health of my cells and allows me to regain some of the benefits from my youth.

I’ve been taking the recommended dosage of Basis by Elysium faithfully for 2 months now. I’m a healthy, fit 29 year-old (almost 30) and do feel something is different. I have a subtle increase in energy. My body and mind are just “working” a bit better and more effeciently. My body feels more resilient and my mind just a bit sharper. I am having crazy, vivid and intense dreams every night though, which is interesting! I take no other supplements and no medications, and it started about a couple weeks in I would have a crazy dream every once in awhile to having them more frequently about a month in and just gradually increasing. I’m two months in and I’m having these vivid, detailed, and intense dreams every night, all night long, one after the other… and waking up remembering them! There is no doubt in my mind that it is indeed the Elysium. I just find it a fascinating side effect!

I have been Taking Basis for 5 months or so and have have more energy and have healed astoundingly fast from some injuries including fractured arm and oral surgery. I have recommended it several friends who notice a difference and even got my mom on it, who seemed to heal from broken ribs quickly despite her age. After 2 months of auto ship I bought the yearly which is $40 a month. I’m totally convinced it does what it claims. I’ve had no problem contacting them and putting my mom’s monthly auto ship on hold. 
I can’t wait till they develop thier new products. I’m sure new treatment for Dna degradation of cells will emerge but I’ll be way ahead of the game by that point.


Reply 






Are you saying that because you knew your mom would live longer that you canceled her monthly supply?

I would like to order some. I live in New York. Can I please get directions as to how to order or where to buy?

I would like to buy from Hungary. Do you ship in HUNGARY? How much would the shipment be?
Please let me know and thanks a lot in advance.

I first read the results of the basic benefits and why in the January 2012 issue of “Scientific American”. I wonder why it has taken 4 years to start human trials? It is such a breakthrough IF it works on humans, especially us older persons. David Crockett.

trials monitoring aging might take 30 years; if you are over 50 do not wait for it

You have never tried to get approval for human trials….It is a VERY lengthy process…..

Yes but it has to begin sometime. Are you saying that there should never be trials because it is a lengthy process?

66 years old; working out every day; taking BASIS for 30 days; In my case it does seem to increase my energy levels slightly and it does help with recovery from weight lifting. For me it works best when I take it before I go to sleep. I take no other supplements. Yes, it is unproved in clinical studies. If you have time, wait 30 years for results of those studies. I do not.

I’m trying to buy this product but they keep asking for a personal Referral Code how and where do I find one.


Reply 






don’t buy it.Their phone does not work and there is no way to communicate with them. I had to cancel my credit card to stop payments. WARNING it’s a scam.


Reply 






I first bought a one month supply almost a year ago and received it in a timely manner. I then purchased a yearly subscription beginning the next month through their online store. The purchase through the store worked perfectly. I receive the product I purchased in a timely manner each month. I am a very happy and satisfied customer.

I have been taking this supplement for years now and it seems to counter the pesky effects of this darn ring that is stuck on my finger. Side effects..hairy feet and pointy ears.

This is health insurance people. Otherwise, just stick to the toxic stimulants.

Where are all the comments for 2016 did everyone stop taking this I don’t understand why Arnt more people talking about this today is June 25 2016 I took my 2 pills and I’m dozing and feeling tired I hope this isn’t that type of pill and the fact that it say something about Red Wine similar to well I don’t drink any wine or anything for that matter because alcohol beverage’s make me tired so anyone on here anymore have any good or not so good things to tell us on how your doing with this supplement.


Reply 






I have been taking Basis for a few months. The capsules I take are
white. I read that they are supposed to be blue tablets not white
capsules. Am I taking a scam version that is saying it’s Basis?


Reply 






I’m almost through my second bottle. I know it should take a long time for any noticeable effects, but I’ve felt more tired, have less stamina, stomach ache, and sleeplessness. Going to stop taking it and see if these symptoms clear up.

King David addressed this issue over 2000 years ago:
“Who is the man who desires long life, who longs to see many good days? Guard your tongue from speaking evil…Avoid evil, do good and pursue peace.” That is the answer, not necessarily swallowing a “magic pill.”


Reply 






I took Niagen for a month, & got no effect. A couple of weeks later they (Live Cell I think) called to see how I was doing. I told them, & they suggested that I take double doses with the second bottle. I went through that in two weeks, & still nothing. Recommendations anybody?


Reply 






We have a product that has absolutely no evidence of working on people. If the product worked it would be over the long term & no one would feel the benefits. We have 5 Nobel Prize Winners that are on our advisory board & they all agree, no benefits are proven in Humans. We will do anything to make you feel as if there is promise in the potential of our product including mentioning its proven effectiveness in mice, which to any expert means nothing. There are so many cures that work on mice & not on humans that it would take a book to list just those. Who here thinks the people behind this company feel shame?


Reply 






I have a degree in Molecular Biology from a prestigious US research university; all of the research and information I’ve read about this product makes sense to me based on everything I learned in school. I don’t say this to try to say that you should change your mind. I think it is up to each of us to decide whether to use this supplement based on current information that is available. I do say this to raise my hand and say, hey, this all makes sense to me personally and I’m happy to say I take these supplements daily and I do think you should stop trying to make other people change their minds. I think each of us should read the available literature and make our own decision whether to take this supplement or not.


Reply 






Thank you for adding intelligence to this blog. Everyone who is interested in Basis should read the literature on all the ingredients in Basis ( a metabolic repair & Optimization product); then make your decision whether to subscribe.


Reply 










Do we add this supplement to our daily supplement program or is the only product we need?


Reply 






It’s not a nutritional supplement so if that’s what you’re referring to then yes, just add it to your normal intake of supplements. It’s not a substitute for anything. You should still take your medications. Still take the supplements you take. There aren’t any negative interactions that I’m aware of.


Reply 








How and where do I order some Basis !!!!!!!


Reply 






Do you ship to Norway?
Tried to enter an order on Your site, but Norway wasn’t on the list.


Reply 






If you were wondering whether the sales approach based on no evidence, worked on anyone, here is your answer. You could be on a deserted Island on the far side of antartica & if there are vulnerable people there, I am certain this company will find a way to find them, get them in touch with their desires, have them convince themselves based on cruel hopes & deliver to them.

There are a lot of comments about feeling a big difference or not. Cellular health isnt about that at all. This isn’t Red Bull. Cellular health alludes to things that affect us positively (or negatively or not at all) that are not evident by mere observation. Years of trials will need to be done on this and until then everyone who takes the product is acting on faith (myself included)


Reply 






Lawrence,
I just started taking this today and while I’ve been reading the comments I keep dozing off have u Hurd anything about tiredness ?? Well I guess I’ll try again tomarrow it’s seems the very few people experienced energy and profound clearness in any way so that is disappointing to me to say the least , keep me posted hope your doing well with this . Sincerely Nancy


Reply 






get your money back


Reply 










I ordered one sixty doaller supply and have been taking two capsules in morning now for about three weeks . What I have been experiencing is increased energy and sometimes a jolt of uncontolable energy burst around mid morning . This seems to Acurr after a morning run . I also feel that I have experienced an heightened mental clarity . I plan on finishing this supply and ordering another . I will not do the prescription plan as I don’t want to be locked in . I do feel that the website and the whole delivery of the product is very well thought out maybe even more then the effectiveness of the product which makes me a little skeptical . But let see what happens .


Reply 






Today is the second day that I’ve taken my 60 day supply of Basis. What you refer to as an ‘energy burst’ I am experiencing as feeling uncomfortably hyper, maybe like when I accidently took 4 Sudafed instead of 2 for sinus congestion. My ‘clarity’ too is more visual than mental again like my first reaction to taking Claritin for allergies…….


Reply 








We took Elysium’s product for a couple of months and did not experience any detectable differences.
Be careful signing up with a subscription – we cancelled with them and although they confirmed the cancellation in writing, they continued to charge our credit card and have yet to issue a refund. Furthermore, they are trying to get us to take responsibility for the return of the unsolicited item.
Just an FYI, folks.


Reply 






Thank you it sounds like that fx150 testorstorone scam


Reply 






This is about cellular health. It is not a stimulant or performance enhancing drug. You may not notice anything at all except that, possibly in the long term, you remain healthier in many ways. For instance, if you don’t get cancer…how will you know if that’s a result of the NR and Pterostilbene of Basis? Will you really notice better cognitive function as you age? how would you? You would have to be able to switch back and for between the non-Basis version of you and the Basis version of you. The science is very sound but you have to make an effort to understand what they’re saying and take it on faith as Lawrence (above) noted. It’s not some cure all for everything. It’s more like taking your car in for regular maintenance all the time. Your car runs perfectly for 20 years. Is that because it’s an amazing engineering job and you just got lucky? Or because you spent the money maintaining the car in optimum shape?


Reply 






I’m in it for the long haul, and I firmly believe that what I am putting into y body will give me a longer healthier life. There will always be people who “feel” something from any particular supplement and those who “feel” nothing.


Reply 








I received my Basis supplements this past week. I take the second pill just before bed. I have now been having the most AMAZING dreams! Am wondering if this is a side effect. Dreamt I was flying! Swooping around with iridescent blue butterflies and brilliant yellow hummingbirds! Each night a vivid dream. Worth it just for these terrific dreams. Not sure when any other effects will kick-in.


Reply 






how does your energy level feel


Reply 






The other guy said this isn’t a red bull and it’s not a stimulant so I’m sitting here reading comments and dozing off as if I’m totally exhausted has anyone had this experience like this ??


Reply 






I had crazy dreams as well! But not necessarily as enjoyable as yours. They started in the first day or two. I normally remember my dreams but these were just so vivid and crazy, coming night after night, that I emailed them about it and they said they had not heard of this before. I got sort of scared to go to sleep, but they eventually went away. I stopped taking Elysium but now have a few more left and thought I should just finish them. But I wanted to google around to see if anyone else has experienced this. You’re not alone!


Reply 








I’m reading an interesting mix of comments that appears to weigh on the positive side with the 50 plus crowd and not so positive on the under 50 crowd. I’m 62 and have been taking Basis for almost a month now. I workout 5 to 8 hours a week depending on my busy schedule. I do feel a subtle change in positive energy both at work, recovering after workouts especially the next day. I’ve also noticed a bit more mental clarity in my day to day communications and ability to absorb information. I’ll likely try it for another 6 months and see how it goes.


Reply 






I’m 64 and just a week in…would like to touch base with others in our age bracket…I’m doing the ketogenic diet as well and that alone has helped my recovery time from workouts. I used to come home and just crash after a workout…now I’m up studying and lively til’ bedtime…


Reply 






Bruce, i am 65 and thinking of buying Basis. Can you give me an update on how it has worked for you since your last post.


Reply 










I tried this supplement for a week, hoping to feel some benefit. I am a 39 yr old male in good condition. Eat healthy and workout 4-5 x’s a week. Unfortunately, I did not notice any additional energy. If anything I felt more tired and not my usual self. 2 days after I stopped taking it I came down with the flu. Probably just a coincidence, but who knows. I would like to try and get my money back. I would not recommend.


Reply 






As i’ve said to others…It’s not a performance enhancing substance. Think of it more like this. You can take this or that supplement and you will notice an increase in performance. The same as if you modify your car with a new part and you now have a higher top speed or more torque etc. Basis is about cellular health. It’s more analogous to you make sure your car is properly maintained at all times. every dent is repaired. it’s protected from rust. you treat the leather etc etc. Your car will not be faster, more powerful or any better looking…It will just be in great shape. You take care of yourself now and maintain your health just fine? That’s great. Keep it up. HOWEVER, Basis addresses the issues that diet and exercise cannot stop. Your body will produce less NAD+. Your SIRT1 activity will drop. Your body will suffer oxidative stress. you can’t avoid those through diet and exercise alone. They help definitely but Basis is designed to return your NAD+ and SIRT1 activity to “younger” state. Pterostilbene is a more potent form of resveratrol and will help to counter the oxidative stress. It’s about body maintenance rather than performance enhancement.

A week? Natural supplements take much longer to work. As has been said, it’s not Red Bull.

Exactly and Red Bull will run out until you drink another !

Took first dose this everning, stomach upset don’t know it is the BASIS or not. Did anyone have a problem at first?

Does anyone know how Basis compares to VitaPulse?
Created by Princeton Nutrients, VitaPulse is a natural supplement that’s claimed to provide advanced antioxidant support to help maintain healthy cardio function and cholesterol levels, protect against cellular damage, decrease inflammation, and boost mitochondrial health and cellular energy.
According to Elysium, after decades of research by leading scientists and clinicians, the Basis nutritional supplement was designed to repair cells damaged by the aging process and environmental toxins, while keeping healthy cells healthy.
How would you compare the two products? Should both be taken? If no, why?


Reply 






I am a 62 year old male that has been lifting weights off and on my whole life since I was 14 years old. I started taking BASIS around the same time that I was starting to lift weights again after being off for two months. I always dread starting back up again due to the extreme soreness that I experience when lifting weights again after an extended off time. I started taking BASIS with my first workout which lasted just under two hours and the first thing I noticed the next day was that I didn’t have the extreme soreness. I worked out on Monday, took a 30 minute walk on Tuesday, worked out again on Wednesday, another walk on Thursday and finally another workout and walk on Friday. I felt excellent!!! In the past, I would have been off the rest of the week after that first workout due to extreme soreness. I can only attribute this energy level and quick recovery to BASIS which I will continue to take.


Reply 






I am 42 yrs old, and been taking Basis for a month. I just started the 2nd month. I really haven’t felt much of a difference. Is that because of my age? I am hearing that Basis may not be as effective in younger people. Also, I went into the press release area of Elysium, and all of their press is in first half of 2015. With a supplement that everyone claims is so revolutionary, I am a bit surprised their hasn’t been any news in more than 9 months. Any comments?


Reply 






I order basis on line, and I received a package in 5 days.which I am happy for that.but the pills in the web side
Look like blue soft gel.instead I received a white capsule.I am confused which is really and which is counterfeit.


Reply 






The white capsule doesn’t have the blue coloring but is the same product otherwise. I think Basis switched several months ago as some supplement takers don’t like coloring dye.


Reply 








My wife and I have been taking it for 2 months, we both notice more energy, better sleep and clearer minds. We are both in our 70s


Reply 






Have seen absolutely nothing as far as changes except extreme desire for more carbs. Don’t think I’ll be reordering because it really hasn’t shown me any benefits.also seeing the same ingredients at local health stores for less than $10. Do your research and maybe save some money.


Reply 






I will look for the ingredients elsewhere first.


Reply 






What is the name of the supplement at your local health store ?


Reply 








Here’s how you know it’s working: you stop taking it and feel crappy (again). I’m blown away by the effect and I’m a total cynic (I’m also very knowledgable about supplements and good health). See for yourself. It blew my mind. Mood lifter, had energy, a clear head, could finish sentences w/o searching for words… I just sent the company feedback, I never do that. Or this. But the product works for real and I have no idea what I’m taking really. ps I’m 50, female and an athlete (former).


Reply 






Hmm. It seems to me that if the product is actually doing what it says it should do, i.e. repair dna, then you shouldn’t feel crappy after not taking it. Repair is repair, no?


Reply 






But we live in a world of instant gratification we want to feel and see an affect of taking a pill that is suppose to be good so I don’t know the mice can’t talk and there hasn’t been anyone on here that had a profound daily accruence while taking this just 1 guy saying he sees colors in his dreams witch that doesn’t sound like seeing colors would add years to my life ! What do you think about this supplement ?


Reply 








Heidi, I can’t believe it. I have been taking one a day for three months. Just last week I was thinking about how my word selection came easier when talking. I don’t feel like I need a nap in the middle of the day. I am old and have increased libido which I was confused about. All coincidence? I don’t know. I was going to chalk up the sentence making to a “good” day but , after what you said, not so sure.


Reply 






I think that it’s possible, over time, that your body integrates it into it’s physiological homeostasis. Then, when you stop taking it, you have, once again unbalanced your homeostasis and it has to readjust. So, you feel tired as your body is working to readjust. For example, the thyroid glands of people who take thyroid supplements, in time, become dormant because the body no longer needs to make its own thyroid hormones. That’s why, people who take thyroid supplements, usually, never get off of them


Reply 








Could you please put my auto-fill order on hold for two months?? I’ve gotten stacked up.
I’m enjoying the product but I’m not sure what to look for in terms of effectiveness. Any suggestions?


Reply 






Bottom line, the product has NOT been tested on humans, even Elysium says “there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice.”. You can already purchase both compounds independently, no information given on the efficacy of them. I’ll wait until human studies are released before spending $60/mo.


Reply 






Been reading up on this and work of Dr.David Sinclair. Looks like the real thing and the next big Health product. Think it might be a good product to try.is there proof of body absorbing and using Nad. Would like to know more. Is this a safe product? Would like to know


Reply 






ChromaDex is the sole supplier of NR (at least where patents are protected) and Elysium uses that. A ChromaDex study showed earlier in the year that taking 100mg of NR boosted NAD levels of 12 adults by 30% whereas 300mg boosted NAD levels 50%. 1000mg also boosted NAD levels 50%. This is likely why Elysium recommends 250mg of NR a day, plus 50mg of the blueberry extract they think has a synergistic effect since like resveratrol but much more bioavailable. 
Also, Elysium’s price has dropped to $40/month of you buy a 12 month subscription. 
Their human trials are expected any week now unless there has been a delay. I’ll consider it after the trial results are announced.


Reply 






Where would we locate the trail data you mentioned?


Reply 






New trial data from ChromaDex and a couple of universities should be coming soon. Unfortunately, I’m not sure how soon. The previous results summary are at ChromaDex’s homepage. They were included in company releases.


Reply 








Still waiting for the trials


Reply 










Is there a money back guarantee if it doesnt work for me? I really want to try it.


Reply 






“BASIS contains two building blocks for NAD: it gives your body the tools it needs to produce NAD on its own. Yes, there are just two ingredients needed to stimulate NAD levels in the body.”
Is there evidence that a person has more NAD after taking a couple of months of BASIS? This seems like a simple test. We should pressure Elysium to release their finding.


Reply 






When BASIS is available, I will buy it and give it a try for 3 months. I believe it is great and… I’m hoping it can reach or extend beyond the grand plateau of the ORIGINAL LIQUID SEASILVER SUPPLEMENT… That SeaSilver went to work on my body (and countless others) and I felt brand new!! Too bad the government shut SeaSilver down… I will be fair to BASIS, and give it time to work, because I sense “honesty”, “sincerity” and a Deep Compassion for human wellness by ELYSIUM.

how can i get Elysium Basis in Italy?


Reply 






I had the same request from a friend of mine in Italy. They do not send there. Even finding someone who may try to send it would be some risky. Once I sent my mom some ordinary supplements from the USA to Italy. She had to go through a stack of papers and statements. Even if she stated it was personal use at the end the pills were returned to me since they were “not registered”.

Forse ti hanno gia’ risposto, ma loro non spediscono direttamente in Italia.
Penso che anche trovare qualcuno che te lo spedisca da qui sia un po’ rischioso: ho mandato da qui (USA) una volta dei supplementi a mia mamma e me li hanno rispediti perche’ “non approvati” anche se per uso personale. Qui ovviamente non ci sono problemi: vai online e ti arriva a casa.

Elysium Health

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Elysium Health is a dietary supplement company founded by biologist Leonard Guarente. In February 2015, they announced a product called Basis which they state will improve cellular health. The product contains nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor to NAD+, and pterostilbene, a polyphenol found in blueberries. The supplements are formulated based on chemicals shown to lengthen the lives of mice and worms in controlled laboratory environments.[1]
The pill contains a chemical similar to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) used in metabolic reactions.[2] The product is not approved by the FDA and they are selling the product as a dietary supplement directly to consumers for $60 per month ($50 with a subscription).[3]

Elysium Health - Product Hunt





























Product HuntThe best new products, every dayAsk●|Log InSign up Featured 8 months agoElysium HealthAnti-aging pillsHealth and FitnessTechget it98 ShareFeatured commentEric Marcotulli@eric_marcotulli · Founder/CEO of Elysium HealthEric Marcotulli, CEO of Elysium Health here. I appreciate the thoughts and ideas offered on this page, and I wanted to provide some of mine in return, as well as answer some of the questions that were outlined.

Efficacy + Clinical Data. Elysium’s mission is to solve the biggest challenges in health. That cannot be done without conducting rigorous clinical research and actually assuming the responsibility of pushing that research forward. In February 2016, we submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov the protocol for the first human study of our product Basis: – a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of 120 healthy individuals between the ages of 60 and 80. (The age bracket was chosen based upon the fact that these individuals would be the most depleted in their levels of NAD+, the critical coenzyme that declines as we age and is the target of Basis). We posted it not only because we wanted to demonstrate our dedication to a rigorously architected study, but because we are also committed to transparency.  

We concluded the study a few months ago, and we have since analyzed the data and drafted a manuscript that we are submitting for the peer-review process – again, because we want to meet and exceed the standards typically found in our broader market. This past week, we announced the topline results of that study:

• In the bracketed age group, study participating taking our recommended dose of Basis saw an average increase in NAD+ levels of 40% in the first 30 days and kept that increase constant at 60 days. This equates to NAD+ levels those individuals would have had during their youth. 
• The p value for this change was <0.01.
• The placebo group did not see a change at all. 
• There were no material adverse events, and the product was well tolerated.

This is important in that, for the first time ever, it was demonstrated that a product, Basis, can safely increase and sustain NAD+ levels. The remainder of our findings and full study analysis will be published in the months ahead. I am happy to see such fervor regarding the need for these studies, and you will see more of them related to Basis and our pipeline products. In fact, a significant amount of our recently announced funding will go toward clinical research conducted at top tier institutions and focused on high-severity areas in human health. 3Share·8 months agoWould you recommend Elysium Health to a friend?😡 NO🤔 MAYBE😍 YESHunterHRyan HooverMakersMEric MarcotulliDiscussionYou need to become a Contributor to join the discussion - Find out how.Kumar Thangudu@datarade · TechnologistElysium Health is claiming to be more scientific than other supplements companies, but they are selling their products before doing the trials.

This is a Nootrobox clone. Look at the team pedigree. Probably nice dudes, but they have no place in 
biochemistry. They'll never subject themselves to actual scientific scrutiny, because they know the entirety of the scientific community would lambast them. Nobel Laureautes is a red flag for false proxies in biochemistry. 

They recruited a subpar scientist just for marketing purposes.
This MIT Leonard P. Guarente guy has a nearly 20 year history of bad runs at labs. Have a look here: http://science.sciencemag.org/co...

A study on worms can not be translated to humans...even mouse studies dont translate...even chimp studies don't translate. But they are a needed stepping stone. If these companies are spouting that they are being more scientific and believe what they are selling then they should get the proof first...just like real drug companies that have to get FDA approval to make their claims.

It’s likely that some of these supplements have minor but perceptible effects and in synergy they have measurable effects, but bypassing the FDA to demonstrate this is not the way to go (the FDA also needs to modify its criteria for efficacy, but that’s another discussion). 36Share·8 months agoChris@coolbearcjs · CEO@datarade Why so much hate for a team that has failed in the past...Failure is a great teacher and not a sign of someone who can never succeed...You seem like you want to hate them because they are going into the same space as your pet company Nootrobox which is fine yet let these guys deliver a product and test it out before you hammer them so hard with such venom...I for one will wait and see what they deliver... 4Share·8 months agoAvery Haskell@averyhaskell · Stanford Computer Science@datarade They raised 20 million from top decile VC'S.

I have a neuroscience degree, and in my experience following Kumar he knows more than enough to speak with authority here.

There's also a big difference between failing to try and failing to succeed. You can fail to succeed, and good on you. Failing to try is not ok in startups because you're playing with people's time and money. In hard sciences like biology and neuroscience when you fail to try—specifically, fail to even do basic accepted scientific practice (let alone legal practice like getting approved by the FDA)—you're playing with people's health and lives.

There is a higher bar in science for a reason. 7Share·8 months agoKumar Thangudu@datarade · Technologist@averyhaskell That's so false. I can provide multiple examples: 

Nootrobox - it wouldn't pass a basic litmus test of scientific experts/researchers.  - funded by A16Z

Lumosity - Fundedy by MenloVentures. It is mostly bad science. 

I understand your desire to continue defending other Stanford CS majors, I imagine it helps your cause, but please understand it could have harmful effects upon consumers. 

I would fight anti-vaxxers tooth and nail, I'll also do the same to these quacks. They're welcome to come out and call me out on my BS, if I'm actually full of BS. I'm totally okay with that, but the reality is that, they won't, because they cannot honestly stand behind the data they're extrapolating into claims. 7Share·8 months agoAvery Haskell@averyhaskell · Stanford Computer Science@datarade Theranos  though.

UpvoteShare·8 months ago😻 Ryan HooverHunter@rrhoover · Founder, Product HuntTechCrunch's @sarahbuhr just scooped their recent funding in the amount of $20m.  From the article:

"But are Elysium’s pills really the fountain of youth? Elysium claims its Basis product can do anything from helping you sleep better to repair your DNA, all leading up to a longer, healthier life. But the ingredients in these pills — a combination of nicotinamide riboside (NR) and pterostilbene — are not proprietary. For one they occur naturally in blueberries and milk, and for another you can actually buy both ingredients used in Elysium’s pills in separate bottles on Amazon for around $19 for a 30-day supply of NR and $12 for a 60-day supply of pterostilbene.

The site describes them as pills that make you feel young, not necessarily anti-aging pills.  This is a wild space that's getting more attention, from VC's and founders, bringing to question science, morality, and sci-fi futures. 😱

Update: The team just announced this statement, clarifying their Series B backed by General Catalyst. 6Share·8 months agojoshua bradley@airjoshb · Celebrating people, making life better.@rrhoover the funny thing about many of these supplements is the base ingredients are often patented and available from multiple sources making it a marketing game. Thorne Research is doing/has done some solid research in this space and has a good product I've been using for several months made from the same patented NR ingredient for a lot less. 5Share·8 months agoKumar Thangudu@datarade · TechnologistThe whole “sirtuins are important determinants of aging” field is looking more and more like a giant steaming pile of bad science, with Guarente/Sinclair at the helm. At some point we have to look beyond the place of work (Harvard/MIT), beyond the journals where most of this is published (Cell/Nature/Science), beyond the whole Boston VC/Biotech jumps of joy, and call a spade a spade. Giving credence to scientific quacks is a disservice to the PH community.

And he’s being advised by five Nobel Prize winners and two dozen other top researchers in their fields. You might pay a little more attention.

The Scientist And The StartupCofounding a supplement company seems an unlikely career move for someone like Guarente, a man who is one of the most well-respected scientists in his field. (“It is a departure,” Guarente admits). Mostly, for him, getting involved in Elysium Health is a decision born out of opportunity and frustration. The opportunity is the chance to make a difference by translating findings in the booming field of aging research directly to consumers today. The frustration is that doing this has taken so long in the first place.“My biggest hope is that we can make available to people something that is currently unavailable, and that it will have a positive impact on their health,” Guarente says.Elysium Health actually had its beginnings in conversations between its other two, younger cofounders, Eric Marcotulli and Dan Alminana, who were then tech investors and gym buddies. Even though they’re both quite health-conscious, they knew they couldn’t halt the march of aging and all the ailments that come with it. Far more than diet or anything else people can control, the biggest risk factor for many of the diseases that kill us–including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease–is simply getting older.

Marcotulli knew something about the market opportunity too, which has also lately attracted the likes of Google (with its Calico Labs project) and other SIlicon Valley investors. He had studied the story of a company called Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which in the mid-2000s was working to take resveratrol, the natural anti-aging compound found in red wine, and alter it into a more potent form that could be patented and developed into a medical drug. In 2008, Sirtris–founded by Guarente’s former postdoc David Sinclair–was acquired by the drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline for a jaw-dropping $720 million.advertisement“The fundamental question was: Are there other natural products out there that could be meaningful? I think resveratrol was the first, and I was thinking there’s maybe the potential for many others,” Marcotulli remembers thinking as he studied the story while in business school.The two started cold-calling scientists involved in aging research and were surprised how many were enthusiastic about the idea, including Guarente. The FDA doesn’t recognize aging itself as a condition, so, instead, companies like Sirtris and GSK are are taking scientific findings about how we age and translating them into drugs that treat specific age-related diseases. The issue is that the clinical trials involved in doing this can take more than a decade, and even then that is no guarantee a drug will be approved. The result has been that, though scientists have made major strides in understanding how and why we age and demonstrating that this aging can be delayed, they’ve so far seen few results in translating their work to help people.The two entrepreneurs wanted to take a very different approach than the drug makers: sell only unaltered natural products, which generally aren’t patented and don’t need FDA approval, and create new kinds of supplements that make no claim to treat a specific disease but promote general wellness instead.“If there’s a benefit that can be had now, then I think it doesn’t make sense to wait a decade or more until some derivative [from a drug company] becomes available–though I’m not saying that’s not a good thing to do too” says Guarente.

The three cofounders have been taking the company’s first product, a pill they are calling BASIS, for the last three to five months. Through its website, Elysium Health will sell a one-month supply to consumers for $60, or $50 with a monthly subscription.Boosting NADThe theory behind the pill is built on work first pioneered in Guarente’s lab on sirtuins, a group of enzymes involved in cell metabolism and energy production that are common to a wide range of living organisms. Researchers have found that boosting the activity of sirtuins, which is sometimes done by calorie restriction diets, can extend lifespan of yeasts, worms, mice, and other animals. Efforts to develop a drug that can have the same effect, without the lack of calories, have been going on for the last two decades, including at Sirtris and GlaxoSmithKline. There are also natural compounds that elevate sirtuins–one is resveratrol, which is already sold as a dietary supplement today. Another is called NAD.advertisementNAD—Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide—is one of the most compelling bits of chemistry related to aging. Its presence in the body is directly correlated with the passage of time: An elderly man will have about half the levels of NAD is his body as a young person. There’s no amount of healthy eating or exercise that can stop the decline. But in a scientific paper published in 2013 that generated headlines about “reversing aging,” Harvard’s Sinclair showed that after a week of giving two-year-old mice a boost of NAD, their tissues looked more like six-month-old mice.Elysium’s pill is an attempt to replicate that process naturally in humans. It contains the building blocks of NAD, so the body can easily absorb the smaller molecules and synthesize its own. The pill also contains pterostilbene, a compound, that is a close relative of resveratrol, but which Guarente says is potentially more potent and effective.Elysium explicitly wants to avoid the charlatan feel of the countless “anti-aging” products on the market today. It isn’t selling the pill as a key to a longer life or to preventing any particular disease, since there isn’t any evidence the pill will do that. A press release the company put out with its launch hardly mentions aging at all. (Another reason is they want to appeal to young people too, who don’t necessarily care about aging, but may want to feel healthier and more energetic). Instead, the founders talks about enhancing basic biological functions: improving DNA repair, cellular detoxification, energy production, and protein function.“We have no interest in being an anti-aging company and extending lifespan,” says Marcotulli. “For us this is about increasing healthspan, not lifespan.”The Future Of Dietary SupplementsThere is a downside to the model: They can’t patent their work. Some companies already sell supplements for each of the two ingredients in BASIS, and others could copy Elysium as soon as it releases its next products. That’s where Elysium’s business model– and its scientific superstars–come in.The company aims to be very different type of dietary supplement company–the founders cite the hip, design savvy consumer brands Warby Parker, Oscar Health, Harry’s, and Nest as their role models. (Warby Parker co-CEO Dave Gilboa and one of its early investors, Kal Vepuri, are angel investors in Elysium. Martin Lotti, creative director for Nike’s soccer division, is a strategic advisor.)advertisement“Our vision and mission is to bring scientifically validated natural health products to market through these traditional retail channels,” says Marcotulli. “But it also takes the best aspects of the pharmaceutical model–the R&D focus, clinical rigor, and following these consumers over time.”Its products will only be sold on its website, where Elysium can control more nuanced messaging than on store shelves. Branding, trust, and scientific expertise are what the team hopes differentiates them from the faceless companies that line Whole Foods’ shelves. At the most basic level, that means trust that the pill contains what it says it contains, but also beyond that, trust that it is doing a person any good.For us this is about increasing healthspan, not lifespan.Elysium assures the ingredients in its products will all be pure, and it will do its own safety testing, as well as test for a basic level of efficacy. Already, says Guarente, it has tested BASIS at a range of doses for safety and to assure that NAD levels in the body actually increase from taking its pill. Over time, the team hopes to also collect data back from customers to start demonstrating some of the longer-term benefits over months and eventually years.Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, says Elysium has a good business idea based on sound science and an impressive team. As someone who is not involved in the company, his one fear is that if something went wrong with a top scientist like Guarente’s name attached, it might set back the whole field of research. Though not required by the FDA, he urges the company to go above and beyond in all of its testing. “People are going to overuse it, and I’m sure if you have too much of it, it could have some effect we can’t predict,” he says.For Elysium’s next products, which might touch on other areas such as brain health or musculoskeletal health, it will start to tap into the expertise of the formidable list of more than 30 scientific advisors signed on–everyone from Eric Kandel, a brain scientist who received the 2000 Nobel Prize in medicine to Tom Sudhof, a cellular physiologist at Stanford who received the prize in 2013. Eventually, it hopes to expand this network of scientific expertise further to as many scientists that want to get involved.If anything, Elysium might make more people aware that aging is becoming something that we may one day treat.advertisement“There has been an explosion of science in the field of aging. And I think the public doesn’t really realize how far aging research has come. We have a lot of ideas about the mechanisms of aging, and tons and tons of pathways that can be optimized, tweaked, or activated to possibly extend lifespan,” says Stanford University aging researcher Stuart Kim, who is on Elysium’s scientific advisory team. “I think the public is probably about 30 years behind our thinking about aging. It’s as if we thought about cancer in the way we did in 1960.”These foods can help you stay productive

The opportunity is the chance to make a difference by translating findings in the booming field of aging research directly to consumers today. The frustration is that doing this has taken so long in the first place.“My biggest hope is that we can make available to people something that is currently unavailable, and that it will have a positive impact on their health,” Guarente says.Elysium Health actually had its beginnings in conversations between its other two, younger cofounders, Eric Marcotulli and Dan Alminana, who were then tech investors and gym buddies. Even though they’re both quite health-conscious, they knew they couldn’t halt the march of aging and all the ailments that come with it. Far more than diet or anything else people can control, the biggest risk factor for many of the diseases that kill us–including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease–is simply getting older.

Marcotulli knew something about the market opportunity too, which has also lately attracted the likes of Google (with its Calico Labs project) and other SIlicon Valley investors. He had studied the story of a company called Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which in the mid-2000s was working to take resveratrol, the natural anti-aging compound found in red wine, and alter it into a more potent form that could be patented and developed into a medical drug. In 2008, Sirtris–founded by Guarente’s former postdoc David Sinclair–was acquired by the drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline for a jaw-dropping $720 million.advertisement“The fundamental question was: Are there other natural products out there that could be meaningful? I think resveratrol was the first, and I was thinking there’s maybe the potential for many others,” Marcotulli remembers thinking as he studied the story while in business school.The two started cold-calling scientists involved in aging research and were surprised how many were enthusiastic about the idea, including Guarente. The FDA doesn’t recognize aging itself as a condition, so, instead, companies like Sirtris and GSK are are taking scientific findings about how we age and translating them into drugs that treat specific age-related diseases. The issue is that the clinical trials involved in doing this can take more than a decade, and even then that is no guarantee a drug will be approved. The result has been that, though scientists have made major strides in understanding how and why we age and demonstrating that this aging can be delayed, they’ve so far seen few results in translating their work to help people.The two entrepreneurs wanted to take a very different approach than the drug makers: sell only unaltered natural products, which generally aren’t patented and don’t need FDA approval, and create new kinds of supplements that make no claim to treat a specific disease but promote general wellness instead.“If there’s a benefit that can be had now, then I think it doesn’t make sense to wait a decade or more until some derivative [from a drug company] becomes available–though I’m not saying that’s not a good thing to do too” says Guarente.

The three cofounders have been taking the company’s first product, a pill they are calling BASIS, for the last three to five months. Through its website, Elysium Health will sell a one-month supply to consumers for $60, or $50 with a monthly subscription.Boosting NADThe theory behind the pill is built on work first pioneered in Guarente’s lab on sirtuins, a group of enzymes involved in cell metabolism and energy production that are common to a wide range of living organisms. Researchers have found that boosting the activity of sirtuins, which is sometimes done by calorie restriction diets, can extend lifespan of yeasts, worms, mice, and other animals. Efforts to develop a drug that can have the same effect, without the lack of calories, have been going on for the last two decades, including at Sirtris and GlaxoSmithKline. There are also natural compounds that elevate sirtuins–one is resveratrol, which is already sold as a dietary supplement today. Another is called NAD.advertisementNAD—Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide—is one of the most compelling bits of chemistry related to aging. Its presence in the body is directly correlated with the passage of time: An elderly man will have about half the levels of NAD is his body as a young person. There’s no amount of healthy eating or exercise that can stop the decline. But in a scientific paper published in 2013 that generated headlines about “reversing aging,” Harvard’s Sinclair showed that after a week of giving two-year-old mice a boost of NAD, their tissues looked more like six-month-old mice.Elysium’s pill is an attempt to replicate that process naturally in humans. It contains the building blocks of NAD, so the body can easily absorb the smaller molecules and synthesize its own. The pill also contains pterostilbene, a compound, that is a close relative of resveratrol, but which Guarente says is potentially more potent and effective.Elysium explicitly wants to avoid the charlatan feel of the countless “anti-aging” products on the market today. It isn’t selling the pill as a key to a longer life or to preventing any particular disease, since there isn’t any evidence the pill will do that. A press release the company put out with its launch hardly mentions aging at all. (Another reason is they want to appeal to young people too, who don’t necessarily care about aging, but may want to feel healthier and more energetic). Instead, the founders talks about enhancing basic biological functions: improving DNA repair, cellular detoxification, energy production, and protein function.“We have no interest in being an anti-aging company and extending lifespan,” says Marcotulli. “For us this is about increasing healthspan, not lifespan.”The Future Of Dietary SupplementsThere is a downside to the model: They can’t patent their work. Some companies already sell supplements for each of the two ingredients in BASIS, and others could copy Elysium as soon as it releases its next products. That’s where Elysium’s business model– and its scientific superstars–come in.The company aims to be very different type of dietary supplement company–the founders cite the hip, design savvy consumer brands Warby Parker, Oscar Health, Harry’s, and Nest as their role models. (Warby Parker co-CEO Dave Gilboa and one of its early investors, Kal Vepuri, are angel investors in Elysium. Martin Lotti, creative director for Nike’s soccer division, is a strategic advisor.)advertisement“Our vision and mission is to bring scientifically validated natural health products to market through these traditional retail channels,” says Marcotulli. “But it also takes the best aspects of the pharmaceutical model–the R&D focus, clinical rigor, and following these consumers over time.”Its products will only be sold on its website, where Elysium can control more nuanced messaging than on store shelves. Branding, trust, and scientific expertise are what the team hopes differentiates them from the faceless companies that line Whole Foods’ shelves. At the most basic level, that means trust that the pill contains what it says it contains, but also beyond that, trust that it is doing a person any good.For us this is about increasing healthspan, not lifespan.Elysium assures the ingredients in its products will all be pure, and it will do its own safety testing, as well as test for a basic level of efficacy. Already, says Guarente, it has tested BASIS at a range of doses for safety and to assure that NAD levels in the body actually increase from taking its pill. Over time, the team hopes to also collect data back from customers to start demonstrating some of the longer-term benefits over months and eventually years.Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, says Elysium has a good business idea based on sound science and an impressive team. As someone who is not involved in the company, his one fear is that if something went wrong with a top scientist like Guarente’s name attached, it might set back the whole field of research. Though not required by the FDA, he urges the company to go above and beyond in all of its testing. “People are going to overuse it, and I’m sure if you have too much of it, it could have some effect we can’t predict,” he says.For Elysium’s next products, which might touch on other areas such as brain health or musculoskeletal health, it will start to tap into the expertise of the formidable list of more than 30 scientific advisors signed on–everyone from Eric Kandel, a brain scientist who received the 2000 Nobel Prize in medicine to Tom Sudhof, a cellular physiologist at Stanford who received the prize in 2013. Eventually, it hopes to expand this network of scientific expertise further to as many scientists that want to get involved.If anything, Elysium might make more people aware that aging is becoming something that we may one day treat.advertisement“There has been an explosion of science in the field of aging. And I think the public doesn’t really realize how far aging research has come. We have a lot of ideas about the mechanisms of aging, and tons and tons of pathways that can be optimized, tweaked, or activated to possibly extend lifespan,” says Stanford University aging researcher Stuart Kim, who is on Elysium’s scientific advisory team. “I think the public is probably about 30 years behind our thinking about aging. It’s as if we thought about cancer in the way we did in 1960.”These foods can help you stay productive

The Anti-Aging Pill - MIT Technology Review

The Anti-Aging Pill
Facing a long wait for evidence, a longevity researcher takes an unusual path to market.


					by 
Karen Weintraub

February 3, 2015
























An anti-aging startup hopes to elude the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and death at the same time.
The company, Elysium Health, says it will be turning chemicals that lengthen the lives of mice and worms in the laboratory into over-the-counter vitamin pills that people can take to combat aging.

The startup is being founded by Leonard Guarente, an MIT biologist who is 62 (“unfortunately,” he says) and who’s convinced that the process of aging can be slowed by tweaking the body’s metabolism (see "Is There a Fountain of Youth in Our DNA?").

Everyone is getting older. Few are happy about it.

The problem, Guarente says, is that it’s nearly impossible to prove, in any reasonable time frame, that drugs that extend the lifespan of animals can do the same in people; such an experiment could take decades. That’s why Guarente says he decided to take the unconventional route of packaging cutting-edge lab research as so-called nutraceuticals, which don’t require clinical trials or approval by the FDA.
This means there’s no guarantee that Elysium’s first product, a blue pill called Basis that is going on sale this week, will actually keep you young. The product contains a chemical precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD, a compound that cells use to carry out metabolic reactions like releasing energy from glucose. The compound is believed cause some effects similar to a diet that is severely short on calories—a proven way to make a mouse live longer.
Elysium’s approach to the anti-aging market represents a change of strategy for Guarente. He was previously involved with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, a high-profile biotechnology startup that studied resveratrol, an anti-aging compound found in red wine that it hoped would help patients with diabetes. That company was bought by drug giant GlaxoSmithKline, but early trials failed to pan out.
This time, Guarente says, the idea is to market anti-aging molecules as a dietary supplement and follow up with clients over time with surveys and post-marketing studies. Guarente is founding the company along with Eric Marcotulli, a former venture capitalist and technology executive who will be CEO, and Dan Alminana, chief operating officer.
The company says it will follow strict pharmaceutical-quality production standards and make the supplements available solely through its website, for $60 for a 30-day supply or $50 per month with an ongoing subscription.
“You have high-end prescription drugs up here, which are expensive,” says Guarente, gesturing upward. “And you have the nutraceuticals down there, which are a pig in a poke—you don’t know what you’re getting and you don’t know a lot about the science behind them. There’s this vast space in between that could be filled in a way that’s useful for health maintenance.”
An anti-aging pill with an ivory-tower pedigree could prove profitable. The $30 billion supplements market is growing at about 7 percent a year overall, Alminana says, and at twice that rate for online sales.
Elysium declined to name its investors, but it has some high-level endorsements. Its board includes Daniel Fabricant, former director of the FDA’s division of dietary supplements and now CEO of the Natural Products Association, a trade association. The company also has five Nobel Prize winners advising it including neuroscientist Eric Kandel, biologist Thomas Südhof, origin-of-life theorist Jack Szostak, and the 2013 laureate in chemistry Martin Karplus.
Karplus, now an emeritus professor at Harvard, said in a telephone interview that he was turning 85 this year and had asked the company to send him a supply of Basis as soon as it’s available. “I want to remind myself whether I really want to take it or not,” says Karplus.
Scientists have shown they can reliably extend the life of laboratory mice by feeding them less, a process known as “caloric restriction.” That process seems to be mediated by biological molecules called sirtuins. NAD is important because it’s a chemical that sirtuins need to do their work and is also involved in other aspects of a cell’s metabolism. In worms, mice, and people, NAD levels fall with age, says Guarente, so the idea is to increase levels of the molecule.
“NAD replacement is one of the most exciting things happening in the biology of aging,” says Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, who has coauthored scientific papers with Guarente but is not involved in Elysium. “The frustration in our field is that we have shown we can target aging, but the FDA does not [recognize it] as an indication.”
Other experts said while NAD may decline with age, there is limited evidence that aging can be affected by restoring or increasing NAD levels. “There is enough evidence to be excited, but not completely compelling evidence,” said Brian K. Kennedy, CEO of the California-based Buck Institute for Research on Aging.
Guarente says Elysium’s pill includes a precursor to NAD, called nicotinamide riboside, which the body can transform into NAD and put to use. In addition, the pill contains pterostilbene, an antioxidant that Guarente says stimulates sirtuins in a different way. Both ingredients can already be found in specialty vitamins.  “We expect a synergistic effect [from] combining them,” he says. 
Guarente says Elysium plans to gradually add to its product line with other compounds shown in academic labs to extend the healthy lifespan of worms, mice, or other animals. The company will do preliminary testing to make sure the products are not toxic but will not follow the arduous FDA approval process. Vitamins and supplements can be sold over the counter as long as they contain ingredients known to be safe and don’t make overly specific health claims.
Marcotulli says the company has some anecdotal evidence that Elysium’s pills make a difference. “For older demographics, we’ve heard really interesting feedback related to levels of energy. It’s very, very useful and restorative,” he says. And he takes the pills himself. “When I don’t have a supply, I feel actually fuzzy,” he said. “It’s become a staple of my routine.”
Guarente also says he takes Basis every day, along with 250 mg of resveratrol, the red-wine compound. Guarente also exercises—though not, he says, as often as he should.
He says it doesn’t trouble him that he sees no obvious benefits yet from his supplement regimen. Too many studies in the anti-aging field, he says, are too short-term to show real benefits. Or else they study people who are already unhealthy. “I think that’s the way it would be if something is really acting to slow your progression into decrepitude—you’re not going to notice that,” Guarente says.

 Five Nobel laureates backing antiaging dietary supplement 

Our Review SummaryThe pill described in this story is the first product of Elysium Health, a new company formed with the backing of many leading researchers in the field. The company claims to be science and data driven and suggests that its product is superior to other dietary supplements that haven’t been scientifically validated. We think the story should have been more forceful in exposing the hypocrisy of that stance. The company says it will provide evidence to support its claims at some point in the future, but it is selling the supplements NOW. So it is essentially doing the same thing that other unscrupulous supplement sellers are doing — enriching themselves based on the “promise” of a product that hasn’t been shown to provide any health benefit. The fact that Nobel laureates are the ones doing it is unfortunate, since their stature will distract consumers from the emptiness of the company’s claims.
With all that being said, the article does inject some context and a healthy dose of skepticism into this trendy topic. It doesn’t accept the company’s claims without challenge. It juxtaposes the big name affiliations of the company’s leaders and advisers with the uncertainty surrounding their wares. We just think it should have done more on that front and put it higher up in the story.
 Why This MattersDietary supplements are widely available but lightly regulated. When big scientific names back such a product, good reporting is critical to cut through the hype and shed light on the product’s real value. We’re pleased to see that many commenters on this story apparently saw through the smoke screen of Nobel names and sniffed out what’s really going on here:

“Mice are not people, and these guys are making those claims based on mice trials alone. If those pills are such a cat’s meow, how about getting some human volunteers to test them on, and give enough time to have real, provable results. Then publish a scientific paper based on that.”
“Wow! Nobel laureates “advising” a company on dietary supplements! Shades of Linus Pauling! But people still swear by massive doses of vitamin C to cure anything and everything.”
“Apparently, even Noble Laureates need to make a buck. Where’s the meat…Ooops… the data?”
“How about if you conduct the studies in humans, and IF they are positive, THEN you market the pill?”



Criteria


Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

Satisfactory The story tells us early on in the story that a month’s supply of the pill, called Basis, costs $50-60. So consumers will pay up to $700 a year for the privilege of helping the company test its pills.



Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Not Satisfactory The article quotes the company as saying that higher levels of the “natural compound” (found already in the human body) that is targeted by active ingredients in Basis has been associated with improved health in older mice, and that the pill has not been studied in humans. However, the article doesn’t tell us anything about the mouse studies directly: What sort of “improved health” did researchers find in the mice? Have researchers studied the active ingredients in Basis, or just the compound that these ingredients target?
To be clear, the story also quotes skeptical researchers who are asking very similar questions. For example: “What does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body? And is the outcome the same for everyone?” But did the story pose these tough questions to the company and fail to get a response? If so, a brief acknowledgment of that effort would have earned the story a satisfactory rating here.
Another route to a satisfactory score would have been to summarize some previous studies involving the active ingredients in Basis, such as pterostilbene.



Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

Not Satisfactory The story suggests that supplements such as Basis “have to be shown to be safe for humans to take” prior to being sold, and the story does not mention any potential harms. This language will likely give readers a false sense of security. How can we be sure that a product is “safe for humans to take” if it’s never been tested in humans? Even if we don’t know what specific harms might occur with this supplement, the story could have referenced examples of previous supplements that passed regulatory muster but were subsequently shown to cause serious harm (e.g. ephedra). It could also have mentioned the harm to your wallet of spending $700 a year on an untested product.



Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 

Satisfactory We thought the story could have done a better job of grilling the Nobel laureates associated with this company. For example, it lets one of them suggest that their product is somehow better than the supplements sold at Whole Foods and CVS, where “you see miles of dietary supplements and vitamins” that have “no scientific basis.” In fact, a supplement that’s never been tested in humans also has little if any scientific basis for being sold.
The story does redeem itself later on by explaining the lack of evidence in humans with respect to the Basis pill and dietary supplements in general. Example: “there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice.”



Does the story commit disease-mongering?

Not Satisfactory The premise of the new supplement — one that is never challenged by the story — is that aging is somehow a “condition” that needs to be treated with a new medicine. Loss of muscle and other aspects of aging are normal changes that people experience as they age — not conditions in need of a cure. The framing of aging as a “condition” opens the door to expensive and untested approaches that waste money and encourage the use of more pills that can interact unpredictably. The story should have done more to resist this framing.



Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

Satisfactory The article quotes a reputable source who provides an appropriately skeptical view — one of the strongest aspects of this piece



Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Not Satisfactory We give the story credit for mentioning that each of the active ingredients in Basis are already available in separate pills. But since the story is about a company that claims to offer healthier aging in a pill, we thought it was especially important to mention non-chemical approaches that are also associated with healthy aging, such as a good diet and exercise. The story didn’t do that.



Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Satisfactory The article mentions the pill will be available online and debuted on Tuesday.



Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Satisfactory The story provides excellent context for this product. It explains that the active ingredients are sold separately, but this is the first time this particular compound has been produced.



Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?

Satisfactory The article goes beyond any press release


Total Score: 6 of 10 Satisfactory

About Nobel laureates.  Does anyone remember Long Term Capital ?  They also had a bunch Nobel laureates on staff.  It did not prevent them from loosing their shirts and almost ruining World economy.  Little knowledge is a dangerous thing and we know so little about how body really works, not withstanding all the geniuses with fancy titles.

So true Taruk. It is sad to see scientists involved in sham science for pay.  On balance, MIT and other institutions have been weakened by their focus on monetizing science, which leads to lots of gamesmanship and productization. Marvin Minsky would not have approved.

Your review is too harsh.  The scientists involved are not 90 yr old Linus Paulings.  They are the best in the field, with extraordinary records real achievements.  And they don’t need to make a buck hacking snake oil.  This may not prove out, but the underlying basis, and the support, are night and day compared to other dietary supplements.  Heaping ignorant scorn on everything is the order of the day, but you simply displayed your ignorance in this one.

Allan, 
Your own comment – “this may not prove out” – speaks to the focus of our review. As one of the four reviewers of this piece, I stand by what we wrote nearly 10 months ago when this review was published
“The company says it will provide evidence to support its claims at some point in the future, but it is selling the supplements NOW. So it is essentially doing the same thing that other unscrupulous supplement sellers are doing — enriching themselves based on the “promise” of a product that hasn’t been shown to provide any health benefit.

One man’s “heaping ignorant scorn” is another man’s review of the publicly available evidence, or lack thereof.

We have heard about “guilt by association.” This is a case of “value by association.” The appeal of MIT, Harvard, and Nobel Laureate adds value to an untested product. As an aging adult (I prefer “seasoned adult”) I was drawn to the potential offered in the original article. Being skeptical of most claims, I sought out any evidence or reviews by users. There are several reviews but no evidence that this product does what it claims. This review tells us why we should be skeptical of any of these claims. However, remember the cigarette companies’ claims that “just because rats got cancer doesn’t mean humans will” may debunk that “all species are unique” idea. I will wait to try this product (if I ever do) until there are human trials and data to support the claims. Right now, I’ll hold on to my money. This HealthNewsReview is an excellent example of critical thinking and important for anyone considering buying this product.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1965, when I was 16. I have taken about 20 different FDA-approved and human-tested drugs over the years. The mechanism of action for the great majority is unknown. The human trials, I believe, ranged from 6 to 12 weeks. The FDA does not test nor approve food supplements.
I could not wait 20 years for extensive longitudinal human trials of those medications. I needed relief in the short-term for this debilitating disease. My condition is well-managed with my current medications.
Aren’t mice similar at the cellular level to humans? I have had only a few mildly negative reactions to any of the drugs I have taken.  Those ended immediately when I stopped taking them.
I am not afraid to try Basis for at least 60 days. What have I got to lose, aside from $100?

Jeff,
The list of minimally tested supplements that have caused harm to those taking them is long.  The decision as to whether or not to take such supplements is a personal one and may be influenced by many different factors. We would suggest that applying animal research to humans, without recognizing the huge gap between animal and human physiology, is unwise. Further reading on that topic.

I would like to suggest that this supplement may just be beneficial, or not. However, it is somewhat refreshing to see a supplement which emanated from actual research. One cannot prove the effects of the supplement yet, it may have to be tweaked, and, as with any newly released product evidence may not present itself as to efficacy for quite a long. time. Individuals who this supplement for more then a year or two may just see improved lab results related to liver function. But, that is a BIG maybe. If you “feel” better on the supplement, then it becomes subjective rather than objective. One fact is relevant, there is no fountain of youth.

On the question of whether the story commit disease mongering, I believe the conclusion is wrong. Most chronic diseases appear as we age. When we are young, our metabolic machinery is able to keep these diseases at bay and merely suggesting that it is an accumulation of insults to cellular machinery that is leading to these diseases is totally untested and lacks scientific evidence other than modifications in DNA or other epigenetic changes. One can argue equally well that these lesions in our genetic/epigenetic or other cellular machinery appear because the cells/body begins to lose its ability to repair such insults (there are certainly better evidence for this) . If so, what distinguishes atherosclerosis from aging? Both involve some alternation of the normal cellular machinery which is more-or-less intact when we are young. If so, aging is a disease akin to other chronic diseases that we see in aging. US FDA even has allowed metformin to be tested in clinical trials as an anti-aging agent through monitoring of surrogate diseases markers. It is only a matter of time before we classify Aging as the biggest disease of all.

“The premise of the new supplement — one that is never challenged by the story — is that aging is somehow a “condition” that needs to be treated with a new medicine. Loss of muscle and other aspects of aging are normal changes that people experience as they age — not conditions in need of a cure.”I would disagree with this view of aging that is something that does “not need a cure” just because it’s a natural process. Falling out of a tree and breaking your leg is a natural process too, as is the the occurence of cancer due to immune system deteriation (a specific natural process of aging). It doesn’t mean we don’t treat such conditions. Ignoring treatment interventions because aging doesn’t represent a specific disease seems like faulty logic.
Also, I think thecriticism that “the story does not compare the approach with existing alternatives” is misplaced.  The focus of the story was the Elysium product; it was not meant to be a treatise on aging interventions.
I think the rest of the critique is basically valid.

Twenty years ago Vitamin A was all the rage in the anti oxidation community. Unfortunately, over the past twenty years it has become obvious that vitamin A supplements can and do increase overall cancer risks, not reduce them. Furthermore, anti oxidation is not a health benefit at the cellular level but rather an interfering property in the body’s continual adjustment to age related changes. Specifically, oxidation occurs for a reason, and one is its ability to destroy cells  in a timely fashion before they become dysfunctional(read cancerous) to the body. I suspect this latest fad will go the way of the Vitamin A hype and the fen-fen disaster of bygone times. Hopefully there will not be lethal carnage before the hype is replaced by real knowledge.

I agree with the sentiment here, but I think it’s impractical.  Human studies, especially anti-aging studies, literally take decades to produce conclusive results.  An advantage of mouse studies is the drastically shorter life span of mice, which can give a quick indication of the possible benefits of a health regime.
IMO, the Elysium claims come with a big asterisk: the claim is unproven in humans.  And any real “proof” is years off.  If one believes their claims, though, their claims have been demonstrated in mice.  As with all supplements, act accordingly.

The fact it’s unproven doesn’t mean it doesn’t work, just that we have no idea if it works.
I think it is good that they are going ahead with it, despite their lack of research on humans.  Proving/disproving this would probably take decades, even if there were adequate funding.  So the real choice of something proven versus something unproven doesn’t exist in this realm.  Small animal studies with shorter lifespans are, as of now, the only relevant tests even if they aren’t conclusive.  I hope there will measures of ageing in humans that will point out if something is helping or not without waiting decades to see.  But I think it’s unrealistic to expect to be able to buy a treatment at your friendly health food store that is proven yet somehow undiscovered by the World.  It is good to point out that animal studies don’t prove a thing, besides the concept.  They don’t translate to people.  It’s like the old joke “What’s the problem using lawyers instead of lab rats for medical studies?  ans.  It’s hrder to extrapolate the results back to the human population”

I was going to write what Allan Lindh wrote and think the critique was too harsh of a surprisingly good article. One person asked if any of the scientists were taking Elysium Basis. The founder, Leonard Guarente was quoted in another article when the news of the new company came out that he was taking Basis along with 82mg of aspirin, 2500 units of Vitamin D and 250mg of resveratrol. 
Nobel Laureate Martin Karplus “said in a telephone interview that he was turning 85 this year and had asked the company to send him a supply of Basis as soon as it’s available. “I want to remind myself whether I really want to take it or not,” says Karplus.”   (MIT Technology Review, Feb 3, 2015)
I haven’t tried Elysium Basis yet and will buy the ingredients separately if they cost less (so far they haven’t from what I searched). My friend who is 45 has tried it for 8 months and is very happy with Basis. She reported that a few years ago, she tried to go from 120 lbs to 110 lbs with diet and exercise and met her goal but was “starving” so quit. Last summer, after taking Basis for a while she again saw she had dropped to 110 lbs but that unlike before it was effortless and felt great. This is similar to when I took 500 mg of resveratrol for a few weeks and saw the same percentage drop in weight – 6%. (When I reduced the amount to 250mg a day, the weight came back.)  
Human studies have been conducted through the NR wholesaler ChromaDex that showed safety and that 100 mg, 300 mg and 1000 mg of NR increased NAD in the subjects. They have started a new longer trial and the earlier trials will appear in a peer reviewed publication this spring.  Three major universities have also completed NR trials but publishing takes time. 
I agree that some detail of the mouse studies should have been summarized in the article.  unlike your 6 out of 10 rating, i’d give the article a 9 out of 10.

Todd,
As we’ve said time and again, anecdotes are not evidence. The experience of a few people who’ve taken the supplement is not science. Claims about safety based on data that haven’t been published aren’t justified. Our critique of the story and the related product marketing stand.

This simply isn’t true. Anecdotes are evidence, but I agree only some  evidence. The peer review study will be out very soon, although I think only showing that NR significantly increases NAD in humans, just as it has been shown to in mice. I’m still waiting to take it, but I know what 500 mg of resveratrol  did to me almost ten years ago. What I don’t know is if those good changes in weight loss and stamina would have continued had I not reduced to 250 mg.  To say ” So it is essentially doing the same thing that other unscrupulous supplement sellers are doing — enriching themselves based on the “promise” of a product that hasn’t been shown to provide any health benefit.” was way over the top. Have you emailed the six Nobel Laureates at Elysium or the Nobel laureate who advises Chromaex? I thought not.

Todd,
We’ll have to agree to disagree on this. I don’t see what point there would be to emailing the Nobel laureates at Elysium. Either a product has evidence showing a health benefit in humans or it doesn’t. This product doesn’t. End of story. Thanks for reading and commenting.

Thank you for breaking the spell as I was starting to go down the rabbit hole. Great article. When I read the article I got the same feeling I get when I watch an infomercial. So I went to their website which is pretty slick. The thing that made me research a little further was the lower price if you buy a 12 month supply. This is a classic ripoff tactic where they tap your bank account and it’s difficult to cancel. Sure enough on another site people were complaining about being charged after cancelation. Then I found this website and your fair and balanced critique. Good work. I will get a massage with that $50 a month!

What everyone misses here, is the power of the human mind. The placebo effect is a proven feel good pill. If people are really convinced that the supplement they are taking is beneficial, their positive thoughts will trancsend into better health! Mind over matter exists, as numerous studies show positive people heal much faster than their negative counterparts. Let the placebo effect do its work even at high cost if it helps. Just a thought.

Clearly it’s not reasonable or practical to expect a-priori results proving efficacy in humans – unless you’re willing to wait on hell of a long time for something not to happen. I’m not.

Your article criticises the lack of human trials to establish efficacy. Mice are not humans.
Well, first of all mice do share some similarities that make them effective subjects to test certain treatments. Most importantly though, mice have a very short life span (approx 2-3 years max). So testing NR for example on mice and observing that a previously 2 year old mice is now exhibiting traits of a 6 months old mice is significant. To replicate this in humans would (given the human lifespan vs the lifespan of mice) take decades to come up with any conclusions. 
The company Elysium does not make any direct claims but it does draw parallels. Naturally, if their product were to effectively slow down your aging or even reverse it to some degree at a cellular level, then the person taking the supplements would probably not notice very much.
So I do agree that this is another product sold to an audience of primarily aging people who want to stop or reverse the process. Some very smart people to indeed feel that aging is a condition rather than something that inevitably happens, and that extending our lifespan is something that absolutely  will happen, as it has already. Just compare today’s life expectancy of an American or European, to that 100 years ago. It has increased by well over 75%.

As a psychologist, I would suggest there might be a positive placebo effect; nevertheless, if the product is as good as the researchers believe, why fifty dollars a month? If it truly works I know clients would who happily pay thousands per month to potentially live longer… Helping rats live longer might be considered a worthy endeavor, but hardly cause celebre… Simply put, I smell a rat! Show empirical evidence the telomere length is restored and I will be the first in line to buy a decade’s supply… Stem cell research appears to provide far more reliable and verifiable results than supplements IMO… Remember what W.C. Fields once said…

What bugs me the most is the secrecy about ingredients. If the goal of the scientists is to allow benefits seen in the lab for general human population (not greed) and expected results to be seen no sooner then after decades (none of inventors will make fortune in their lifetime) then why to hide information what is in it? It is very uncomfortable to take a chemical on daily bases unknowing what it is. Unless…. (and here you can write any conspiracy theory you can come up with). Saying all that I have purchased one month supply (for good of the science) and used it. Seems to get me off the Netflix and back to daily chores easier, but it may be a placebo effect. I think I will try another one. Placebo or not, things are getting done and that whats counts, unless I will loose my health to it then that will kinda suck.

I am about to start using Basis. This is in reply to Mr. Piterow’s comment. There are only two ingredients in Basis. Both available readily elsewhere, but Basis is as cheap or cheaper than trying to find the products alone and combining. Interviews that I have read from Dr. Guarante state that Resvatratol efficacy goes
up with ingesting the NAD and so I plan to  begin taking Resvaratol supplements as well. Here is a link to the ingredients-

“Shed light, not just heat. Facts, challenges, disagreements, corrections — those are all fine. Attacking the person, instead of the idea or the interpretation, is neither acceptable nor helpful.”
We”re also concerned about anonymous comments.  We ask that all commenters leave their full name and provide an actual email address in case we feel we need to contact them. We may delete any comment left by someone who does not leave their name and a legitimate email address.
And, as noted, product pitches of any sort – pushing treatments, tests, products, procedures, physicians, medical centers, books, websites – are likely to be deleted.  We don”t accept advertising on this site and are not going to give it away free.
The ability to leave comments expires after a certain period of time.  So you may find that you’re unable to leave a comment on an article that is more than a few months old.

Elysium Health™ Raises $20 Million In Series B Financing Led By General Catalyst, Announces Topline Clinical Trial Results For Its First Product BASIS™, And Welcomes Leading Scientists And Physicians To Its Scientific Advisory BoardHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Breaking News:North Korea launches ballistic missile, Pentagon saysElysium Health™ Raises $20 Million In Series B Financing Led By General Catalyst, Announces Topline Clinical Trial Results For Its First Product BASIS™, And Welcomes Leading Scientists And Physicians To Its Scientific Advisory BoardPR NewswireDecember 6, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Elysium Health, Inc.,  ™  a provider of scientifically-sound dietary supplements, today announced it has raised $20 million in Series B financing led by General Catalyst and joined by Breyer Capital, Morningside Ventures and Sound Ventures. Existing investors include Jim Manzi, chairman, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and former chairman, president and CEO of Lotus Development Corp.; biotech venture capitalist Robert Nelsen; and entrepreneur Matthew Mullenweg.  View photosBASISMoreThe funding will enable Elysium to expand its operations to support the rapid growth of its customer base, as well as initiate additional human clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new products it plans to add to its offerings. In addition, the funds will support Elysium's mission to be a leader in the study of NAD+ and sirtuins within the context of human aging."Since launching Elysium two years ago, we have worked tirelessly to create entirely new ways to make scientific breakthroughs accessible and actionable for people who want to take a proactive role in supporting their health," said Eric Marcotulli, CEO and co-founder of Elysium. "Our first product BASIS ™  is designed to optimize cellular health and is based on expansive research. We look forward to working with our financial partners and scientific advisory board to further develop our product pipeline to continue to bring meaningful health products to market.""Elysium is an innovative company, with an amazing executive team and scientific advisory board, committed to reframing the way we think about our health," said David Fialkow, managing director, General Catalyst. "We are thrilled to invest in Eric and his team to help expand and enhance the scientifically-sound products they intend to bring to the market in the future."Elysium Announces Topline Clinical Trial ResultsElysium also announced today that its first human clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its first product, BASIS ™ , met its primary and secondary endpoints. The study, which was placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blinded, evaluated the safety and efficacy of BASIS ™  [nicotinamide riboside (NR) and pterostilbene] in 120 healthy participants ages 60-80 over an eight-week period. Participants received either the recommended dose (250 mg NR and 50 mg pterostilbene), double the recommended dose or a placebo daily for the eight-week trial.The study found that participants experienced no serious adverse events and confirmed that BASIS ™  is safe for daily use as determined by standard safety measures. The study also showed that in participants taking the recommended dose of BASIS,  ™  NAD+ levels increased from baseline in whole blood by an average of 40% at four weeks and maintained that increase for the duration of the trial. Participants taking double the recommended daily dose saw their NAD+ levels increase approximately 90% at four weeks, and a significantly higher level of NAD+ (compared to the recommended dose of BASIS ™ ) was maintained for the duration of the trial. This first-in-humans study demonstrates clearly that BASIS ™  can increase NAD+ levels in the blood safely and sustainably. Confirming that BASIS ™  is an effective NAD+ precursor in humans is a vital first step to elucidating how BASISTM supports human health."As we age, NAD+ levels in our cells decline. The trial results, which are the first of their kind, indicate that BASIS ™  increases NAD+ levels in a sustained way. And since NAD+ is involved in hundreds of critical cellular processes, it is a vitally important component to optimizing our cellular health as we get older," said Dr. Lenny Guarente, chief scientific officer and co-founder of Elysium who also serves as the director of the Glenn Laboratory for the Science of Aging at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "We plan to submit the full results of the trial to a peer-reviewed scientific journal."Elysium Adds Three World-Renowned Scientists and Physicians to Its Scientific Advisory BoardTo support Elysium's mission of researching, validating and distributing scientifically-sound health products, it established an unprecedented Scientific Advisory Board composed of more than two dozen of the world's leading scientists and clinicians. This scientific board works with the Elysium team to accelerate the exchange of ideas and research findings, evaluate data and help ensure a high level of scientific rigor and transparency in the development of Elysium's products.Elysium is honored to welcome to its Scientific Advisory Board:George M. Church, the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT. Richard Granstein, M.D., Chairman of Dermatology Weill Cornell Medical College. Paul L. Modrich, James B. Duke Professor of Biochemistry at Duke University and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2015.About BASIS  ™  BASIS ™  is a daily product that supports metabolic health. The proprietary formulation of nicotinamide riboside and pterostilbene is designed to increase levels of the coenzyme NAD+ and to support a class of proteins called sirtuins. NAD+ and sirtuins work together in vital cellular processes including energy production. BASIS ™  is available to consumers exclusively through the Elysium Health ™  website (www.elysiumhealth.com). The cost for BASIS ™  is $60 for a 30-day supply or $50 per month on a subscription plan.About Elysium Health  ™  Elysium Health's ™  mission is to solve the biggest challenges in health with science, to help people live healthier, longer lives. Working directly with the world's leading scientists and clinicians, Elysium Health ™  translates advances in science and technology into effective, scientifically-sound products that help people manage their health in an actionable way.View photosFounders of Elysium Health.MorePhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161206/446067Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161206/446066 To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elysium-health-raises-20-million-in-series-b-financing-led-by-general-catalyst-announces-topline-clinical-trial-results-for-its-first-product-basis-and-welcomes-leading-scientists-and-physicians-to-its-scientific-advisory-boa-300373896.htmlSOURCE Elysium HealthReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityNorth Korea fires missile which lands in sea off Japan892 reactions3%77%20%Discover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsored‘New York City Up and Down’ — Four decades through the lens of photojournalist Jean-Pierre Laffont1 reactionsMan says he killed wife aboard cruise ship because 'she would not stop laughing at me': Affidavit3,259 reactions4%73%23%George Clooney Promises Legal Action Over Paparazzi Photos Of Infants452 reactions4%73%23%Engineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredSyria's unexploded cluster bombsSeth Moulton thinks Democrats needs ‘new generation’ of leadership14 reactions17%59%24%Luis Fonsi On Justin Bieber's Spanish, 'Despacito' Hitting No. 1530 reactions3%80%17%Talbots® Official SiteTalbotsSponsoredMcCain’s ‘no’ vote on GOP health bill elicits gasps in Senate chamber3,158 reactions8%68%24%How Al Gore Was Saved From Accidentally Declaring His Candidacy for President at Oscars99 reactions1%81%18%'LBJ' Trailer: Woody Harrelson Completely Transforms for Rob Reiner's Presidential Biopic424 reactions3%81%16%Avoid Mattress MarkupsSaatva MattressSponsoredDozens injured in Barcelona commuter train crash15 reactions0%93%7%Mitch McConnell: ‘I regret that our efforts were simply not enough this time’23 reactions4%50%46%Trump Rages at Republicans as John McCain Kills Obamacare Repeal BillSuzy Q: Trump PROMISED he had a healthcare bill that would lower costs, expand coverage, and offer more choices.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
