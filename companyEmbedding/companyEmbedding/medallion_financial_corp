NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medallion Financial Corp. (Nasdaq:MFIN) announced that earnings, or net 
      increase in net assets resulting from operations, were $4,568,000 or 
      $0.19 per diluted common share and $11,416,000 or $0.47 per share in the 
      2016 second quarter and six months compared to $8,086,000 or $0.33 per 
      share and $15,154,000 or $0.62 per share in the 2015 second quarter and 
      six months. Net investment income was ($0.06) for the quarter and $0.03 
      in the six months, down from $0.18 and $0.38 in the 2015 periods. 
      Combined with Medallion Bank, net investment income was $0.42 and $0.89 
      for the quarter and six months, up from $0.34 and $0.70 a year ago.
    


      Medallion Bank, the Company’s unconsolidated wholly-owned portfolio 
      company, had net income of $8,737,000 and $14,898,000 in the 2016 second 
      quarter and six months, compared to $3,965,000 and $10,730,000 in the 
      2015 periods, increases of $4,772,000 and $4,168,000, partially 
      reflecting the $98,000,000 sale of consumer loans for a $3,200,000 after 
      tax gain. Medallion Bank’s consumer loan portfolio continued to show 
      strong growth, with a decrease in delinquencies from a year ago, and 
      with loss rates remaining at low levels.
    

      Medallion Financial’s net interest margin was 1.57% for the 2016 second 
      quarter, compared to 6.46% in the second quarter of 2015, and was 2.92% 
      in the six months, compared with 6.94% in the 2015 period, reflecting 
      $5,000,000 less in dividends from Medallion Bank in the quarter, and 
      $7,000,000 less in the six months. On a combined basis with Medallion 
      Bank, the net interest margin was 6.71% in the quarter and 6.75% in the 
      six months, compared to 6.93% and 7.05% a year ago, reflecting the 
      continued low cost of funds at the Bank, and the Bank’s higher-yielding 
      loan portfolio.
    

      Andrew Murstein, President of Medallion Financial stated, “We are 
      pleased with the 2016 second quarter and year-to-date results, which 
      reflected stellar results in our consumer and mezzanine lending 
      businesses, and continued maintenance of the medallion lending business. 
      We took valuation allowances against medallion loans and owned 
      medallions of over $6 million in the quarter, and still had a profitable 
      quarter. We believe the NYC medallion industry is improving. To date, 
      our actual losses in medallion lending had been de minimis prior to this 
      year, and were under 1% in the 2016 year-to-date.”
    

      Larry D. Hall, Chief Financial Officer of Medallion Financial, stated, 
      “All the important indicators of our business continue to demonstrate 
      the quality of Medallion’s operations, including continued growth and 
      profitability, solid credit performance by the portfolios, strong 
      capital levels, and an experienced management team.
    

      “For Medallion Financial, loans 90 days or more past due were 10.9%, 
      compared to 8.0% last quarter. On a combined basis with Medallion Bank, 
      loans 90 days or more past due were 5.5%, compared to 4.3% last quarter. 
      Medallion loans 90 days or more past due were 13.5%, compared to 9.5% 
      last quarter, and were 11.6% of the combined medallion loan portfolio, 
      compared to 8.9% last quarter. These rates are comparable to historical 
      levels, such as during our first 10 years as a public company. 
      Delinquencies decreased from May to June which is positive. 
      Additionally, we have extremely conservative underwriting standards and 
      personal guarantees on virtually all of these loans effectively making 
      the loan to value significantly lower. Our net unrealized depreciation 
      on the loan portfolios was 1.91%, compared to 1.43% at year end. 
      Medallion Bank had medallion loan loss reserves of 3.92%, compared to 
      2.81% last quarter, and yet, despite these increased reserves, earnings 
      remained strong,” said Mr. Hall.
    

      “Medallion Financial had realized losses of 1.52% in the 2016 quarter, 
      and 0.87% in the six months, compared to gains of 1.40% in the 2015 full 
      year, and Medallion Bank had a net loss rate of 0.47% in 2016, compared 
      to 1.06% in the 2015 full year. Additionally, Medallion Financial had 
      realized losses of 1.52% on medallion loans in 2016, compared to 0.04% 
      for the 2015 full year, and Medallion Bank had losses of 0.46%, compared 
      to 0.0% for the 2015 full year. These results continue to evidence the 
      solid credit performance of our businesses,” said Mr. Hall.
    

      “Medallion’s debt to equity ratio was only 1.61 to 1, providing ample 
      room for increasing our leverage and growing our businesses down the 
      road,” said Mr. Hall.
    

      Medallion loans were $297,367,000 at quarter end, down $12,115,000 or 4% 
      from $309,482,000 a year ago, representing 46% of the investment 
      portfolio compared to 57% a year ago, and were yielding 4.10% compared 
      to 4.06% a year ago, reflecting our increasing rates as loans refinance. 
      The decrease in outstandings primarily reflected increases in unrealized 
      depreciation reflecting current market conditions, and portfolio 
      shrinkage in most markets. The managed medallion loan portfolio, which 
      includes loans at Medallion Bank and those serviced for third parties, 
      was $641,209,000 at quarter end, down $48,432,000 or 7% from 
      $689,641,000 a year ago, reflecting the above.
    

      The commercial loan portfolio was $88,045,000 at quarter end, compared 
      to $75,292,000 a year ago, an increase of $12,753,000 or 17%, and 
      represented 14% of the investment portfolio in both periods. The 
      increase primarily reflected growth in the high-yield mezzanine 
      portfolio, partially offset by reductions in other secured commercial 
      loans. Commercial loans yielded 12.90% at quarter end, up 5% from 12.23% 
      a year ago, primarily reflecting the change in portfolio mix and higher 
      yields on the mezzanine portfolio. The net managed commercial loan 
      portfolio, which includes loans at Medallion Bank and those serviced for 
      or by third parties, was $124,617,000 at quarter end, up $13,795,000 or 
      12% from $110,822,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting the changes 
      described above.
    

      Investments in Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries were 
      $180,954,000 at quarter end, up $39,822,000 or 28% from $141,132,000 a 
      year ago, primarily reflecting our equity in the earnings of Medallion 
      Bank and other portfolio company investments, capital contributions 
      made, dividends paid, portfolio sales, and net appreciation. Such 
      investments represented 28% of the investment portfolio, compared to 26% 
      a year ago, and yielded 7.16% at quarter end, compared to 14.77% a year 
      ago, primarily reflecting the dividends from Medallion Bank, which were 
      lower in 2016.
    

      Equity investments were $8,626,000 at quarter end, up $1,326,000 or 18% 
      from $7,300,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting portfolio appreciation 
      and sales, and represented 1% of the investment portfolio at both 
      quarter ends, and had a dividend yield of 0.65%, compared to 0.68% a 
      year ago. Investment securities were $69,990,000 at quarter end, 
      compared to $10,059,000 a year ago, representing 11% of the net 
      investment portfolio and had a yield of 0.24%, compared to 2% and 0.63% 
      a year ago, reflecting new investment activity.
    

      Medallion Bank’s consumer loan portfolio increased $75,421,000 or 14% to 
      $618,586,000 at quarter end from $543,165,000 a year ago, and 
      represented 41% of the managed loan portfolio, compared with 39% a year 
      ago, and was yielding 14.62% compared to 14.38% a year ago, an increase 
      of 2%. The increase in outstandings reflected increases in all product 
      lines, particularly the recreational vehicle and home improvement 
      lending portfolios. Including the consumer loans that were sold, the 
      consumer lending business grew by over 30%.
    

      Overall total managed assets increased $210,627,000 or 14% to 
      $1,760,000,000 at quarter end, up from $1,549,000,000 a year ago. Net 
      asset value per share increased to $11.41 per share, up from $11.26 per 
      share one year ago.
    

      Medallion Bank anticipates entering into relationships with marketplace 
      lending platforms. Marketplace lending platforms would collaborate with 
      Medallion Bank, which would originate consumer loans which would be sold 
      to the marketplace platforms with whom it will develop relationships. As 
      such, no substantial capital of Medallion Bank will be required to 
      support such lending, and fee income will be paid to the Bank. Medallion 
      Bank expects its return on equity to be equal or greater than its 
      consumer lending business ROE and anticipates in excess of a 50% return 
      on equity.
    

      Medallion Bank has elected to retain all of its earnings in this 
      quarter, instead of declaring a dividend to the Company. This is due in 
      part to stronger than anticipated loan demand at the Bank. The Company 
      feels that the retention of earnings at the Medallion Bank level to 
      support this strong loan demand and pre-tax return on equity of over 50% 
      is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Due to the 
      foregoing and the below business development company (BDC) and regulated 
      investment company (RIC) considerations, Medallion Financial announced a 
      distribution of $0.05 per share for the 2016 second quarter. This brings 
      the total distributions declared over the last four quarters to $0.80, 
      and equates to a yield of approximately 10% based on the closing price 
      of the Company’s stock on August 1, 2016. The current distribution will 
      be paid on August 31, 2016 to shareholders of record on August 24, 2016. 
      Since the Company’s initial public offering in 1996, the Company has 
      paid or declared in excess of $261,000,000 or $14.61 per share in 
      distributions.
    

      The Company further announced that its Board of Directors authorized 
      management to take steps to analyze and determine whether its current 
      structure as a BDC and RIC is still a viable vehicle for Medallion given 
      its increasing focus on the growth and profitability of Medallion Bank, 
      a tax-paying, non-investment company, wholly-owned subsidiary. If the 
      Company elects to convert from a BDC to a non-investment company and to 
      drop its RIC election, it would not be required to pay out 90% or more 
      of its taxable income and could invest that income in the Bank’s higher 
      earning products. In addition to that benefit, the Company may also 
      realize tax efficiencies, accretive to income, by filing a consolidated 
      tax return with all of its corporate tax paying operating subsidiaries, 
      the largest being Medallion Bank, and potentially offsetting some of 
      Medallion Bank’s taxable income against taxable losses in other smaller 
      subsidiaries. The primary benefit of being a RIC is not paying a 
      corporate level income tax. However, with almost all of the Company’s 
      earnings coming from Medallion Bank, which is already paying taxes, that 
      benefit no longer exists, although it had been a benefit in the past. 
      Furthermore, BDCs have not been permitted to be in certain stock 
      indexes. Medallion previously was included in some of those indexes 
      years ago before BDCs were removed. Thus, if the Company changes its 
      structure from a BDC this year, it could be eligible to be part of those 
      indexes in the future, which could lead to potential new purchases of 
      the stock, and potential increases in liquidity and the stock price.
    

Medallion Financial Corp. is a specialty finance company that 
      originates and services loans in various commercial industries, and its 
      wholly-owned portfolio company, Medallion Bank, also originates and 
      services consumer loans. The Company and its subsidiaries have 
      lent approximately $7 billion to small businesses.

      statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to business 
      performance, cash flow, costs, sales, net investment income, earnings, 
      and growth. Medallion’s actual results may differ significantly 
      from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors 
      that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, 
      those factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors,” in Medallion’s

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

opening a bank account or in other activities establishing your company, and is typically
required if seeking foreign qualification in any
other state.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.
Reserving the name can hinder or delay the filing, if you have already reserved the name
please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.





Will I have the option to act as my own Registered Agent?

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

No, documents requiring signature will be signed by our staff. For the corporation we will
sign as the incorporator and as the organizer for an LLC.
