Chembulk Tankers drops anchor at Delamar Southport

When one thinks of the maritime industry, images of New York, London, Hong Kong and Los Angeles spring to mind. But Southport, Conn.?
With the move on Oct. 11 of Chembulk Tankers, Southport became home to an international chemical tanker company that is part of the global transport system for cargoes that range from liquid bulk chemicals, petroleum products and biofuels such as ethanol to edible vegetable oils. A 21st century creation, Chembulk was formed in January 2007 as a cutting-edge provider of international ocean transportation for the chemical industry, deploying 21st century stainless steel chemical carriers built to the industry's highest standards. The company's previous offices were in Westport.



"We had outgrown our Westport offices, and were attracted to Southport by its New England charm and historical significance as a shipping port," said Chembulk President Jack Noonan. "We looked at space from Norwalk to Fairfield, but honed in on Southport as an ideal place for us to be."
Added Donna Madden, manager HR and corporate administration who was responsible for the renovations and the move, "We loved the fresh, new space in the Delamar building, which also offers a community aspect within the surrounding area. It really feels like a village, and that is very appealing to global businesses."
Part of the convenience is the benefit of having a hotel as part of the complex. "Throughout the year we have numerous visitors including customers and shipbrokers from around the world," Noonan noted. "Having the Delamar hotel available now and a top-notch restaurant opening shortly on our doorstep is an added bonus."
It should be no surprise that Delamar's owners are also aligned with the maritime industry. Led by Charles Mallory, of the historic whaling family the Mallorys of Mystic and one of the founding partners of the internationally renowned Stamford-based shipbrokerage firm MJLF Associates, the consortium features shipowners, financiers and brokers who make up part of the robust shipping community in Connecticut.  
"Delamar Greenwich has for years been a recognized landmark as a world-class locale," observed Mr. Mallory. "Delamar Southport meets the needs of an international clientele complemented by the charm and quiet sophistication of a New England village."
Noonan also appreciates being close to what he termed "restaurant row."  
"We are within a mile or two of great restaurants -- Gray Goose across the street, 55 Degrees, Molto and Martel's, to name a few," he remarked. "It is also a boost that we are right off I-95 and within walking distance of the Metro-North train station. Most of the staff lives in eastern Fairfield County within 20 miles of the office. All in all, it is a very convenient location."  
Noonan also feels a special affinity to the greater Fairfield area as his wife, Kathy Noonan, is a fourth grade teacher at North Stratfield Elementary School.  
"We are looking forward to being a productive member of the community," Noonan said. 
Chembulk Tankers operates 19 owned and leased tankers. Headquartered in Southport, it has offices in Houston, Singapore and Sao Paolo, Brazil. It is an autonomous business unit of the global shipping concern, Berlian Laju Tankers of Jakarta Indonesia, which, in total, operates more than 60 ocean-going chemical tankers.

 The Guitar in America offers a history of the instrument from America's late Victorian period to the Jazz Age. The narrative traces America's BMG (banjo, mandolin, and guitar) community, a late 19th-century musical and commercial movement dedicated to introducing these instruments into America's elite musical establishments. Using surviving BMG magazines, the author details an almost unknown history of the guitar during the movement's heyday, tracing the guitar's transformation from a refined parlor instrument to a mainstay in jazz and popular music. In the process, he not only introduces musicians (including numerous women guitarists) who led the movement, but also examines new techniques and instruments. Chapters consider the BMG movement's impact on jazz and popular music, the use of the guitar to promote attitudes toward women and minorities, and the challenges foreign guitarists such as Miguel Llobet and Andres Segovia presented to America's musicians. This volume opens a new chapter on the guitar in America, considering its cultivated past and documenting how banjoists and mandolinists aligned their instruments to it in an effort to raise social and cultural standing. At the same time, the audiobook considers the BMG community within America's larger musical scene, examining its efforts as manifestations of this country's uneasy coupling of musical art and commerce.

Larsenon February 15, 2008Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseI've been reading books and magazines about the guitar for over 40 years.  At this stage I thought I knew it all.  NOT TRUE!  Doctor Jeffrey Noonan's new book 'The Guitar in America:  Victorian Era to Jazz Age' plows lots of new ground.  Noonan analyzed Banjo Mandolin and Guitar magazines from the 19th century up to the 1930's.  Dr. Noonan not only reveals great musicians I have never heard of, but how the American Guitar and guitar technique developed.  A chapter on William Foden and Vahdah Olcott-Bickford are included.  Noonan makes the reader understand how Sor, Mertz and others were played in America long before Segovia made his 1928 debut.  This book is a must read for any serious student of the history of Guitar, Banjo, Mandolin, or American music in General.  The pictures in the book are way-cool!  I recommend this book without reservation or qualification.  5 stars out of 5!Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsLoved the book!ByGary Gene Clarkon December 14, 2012Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseVery thorough, so impressed that I have ordered for family and friends to share, particularly in the light of the fact that the guitar has become the dominant instrument in America for composing and performing music.  Especially enjoyed reading about the early pioneers and "legends" such as Miss Elsie Tooker of San Francisco.  A wonderful, rich book to read.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsMisleading title very difficult to read!ByGary L.Smithon December 15, 2012Format: Paperback|Verified PurchasePurchased to help with research of Guitars, Guitar makers, Guitar Styles, Guitar production, etc. from the 1880's to 1920's. Unfortunately, the book has little to do with the instrument itself. The book should more appropriately be titled, :The Effect the Guitar had on Music in America: Victorian Era to Jazz Age". Purchasing the book and expecting it to be about the Guitar, ie: "The Instrument" was my bad! That aside, I found this to be the most dry, pretentious and unbearable books I have ever had the misfortune to read. The author could have reduced the verbiage by about 90% and made his case. Difficult to read due to the author's verbosity. Few, if any, points of redemption. In a nutshell, unfortunate. "I have made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter." is a quote attributed to Blaise Pascal which was written in 1657.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA good text for music historiansByJanon July 9, 2015Format: Kindle EditionAs is to be expected of anything published by a University Press, this is a well-researched, scholarly work.  It covers primarily the mid-nineteenth century to the 1920's.  The author designated this as the prehistory of the role of the guitar in musical form.  It also only alludes to the physical changes made to the instrument as time and usage progressed.  It was interesting to learn that the essential difference between English and Spanish guitars was not so much design as whether the strings were of wire or gut.  Much referencing is based upon the periodicals of the early twentieth century promoting the mandolin and banjo, with the guitar taking least place.  These periodicals were not only biased, but vested in promoting a given manufacturer.  In the later years, these publications also lauded and promoted well-known performers of the day.Once again, Jack Chekijian uses his professional expertise to keep the narrative from becoming boring, yet pacing the work so as to allow ease of note-taking.This audiobook was provided by the author, narrator, or publisher at no cost in exchange for an unbiased reviewRead more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer review
