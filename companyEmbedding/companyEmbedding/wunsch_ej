E.J. Wunsch






 


 















 Enlarge





                E.J. Wunsch of Procter & Gamble Co.            






E.J. Wunsch, 39, is associate general counsel at Procter & Gamble Co. He exercises at least three or four times a week in an attempt to not take his health for granted.
Q: Where do you go for advice?











 Enlarge





                E.J. Wunsch of Procter & Gamble Co.            






 


I openly and regularly ask advice of others, as I like to have different perspectives and I never feel obligated to follow that advice. Most frequently, I ask for advice from my wife (who has a great sense and understanding of the “right” thing to do) and my brother (who has a Ph.D. in physics – he’s the smart one).
Q: What part of your job do you enjoy the most?
I enjoy interactions with my colleagues at Procter & Gamble. P&G employees are smart, interesting and fun. It’s always refreshing to interact with them on a daily basis.
Q: Your workday is off to a bad start. How do you turn things around?
I need to spend time alone. Often, I will walk outside, through downtown, to collect my thoughts and regroup.
Q: What habit are you most proud of breaking?
Not exercising. For the better part of my 30s, I did not exercise regularly. For the past couple of years, I have broken that habit and now exercise at least three or four days a week. Your health is one of your most important assets, and one we take for granted too often.
Q: What reality show would you go on, and why?
I do not watch reality shows.




 


Q: Talk briefly about your most life-changing experience.
Right after I turned 30, and after my first child was born, I was diagnosed with an incurable kidney disease. You do not expect to be presented with a potentially life-threatening situation when you are 30 years old and just had your first child. It is truly life-changing. Fortunately, although I still have the disease, my current health is excellent.
Q: Complete this sentence with something from your own life. “You’re not going to believe this, but ...”

I used to have my ear pierced.
Q: What’s your pet peeve?
Tardiness. I cannot tolerate tardiness. It demonstrates a level of arrogance and disrespect – their time is more important than your time.
Q: Do you think you’re pushing yourself enough in your career, or perhaps too much?
Never too little and sometimes too much.
Q: Do you have one movie you watch over and over?
“Casablanca”
Q: What’s the most embarrassing CD in your music collection?
The soundtrack from “Grease”
Q: Do you believe everything happens for a reason?
No.
