They are better than other alternatives like bridges because no additional teeth need to be altered to place the new tooth.RestorativeBridgesRestorative DentistryCrown Lengthening procedures are done for both restorative dentistry and/or to improve the esthetics of your gum line. General practitioners often refer for crown lengthening procedures prior to restoration of broken or severely decayed teeth. This procedure adjusts the gum and bone level to expose more of the tooth so it can be restored.Dental BondingFillingsVeneersBefore you receive your permanent veneer you will first receive a temporary restoration. This is not as sturdy as the permanent version, so you should be careful when cleaning and eating. You should brush the area gently and should not pull up on the tooth when flossing because it could become dislodged. The same goes for eating. You should avoid sticky or chewy foods while you have the temporary in.CrownsWhen decay occurs below the gumline, it may be necessary to remove a small amount of bone and gum tissue. Your dentist may ask for this procedure before he or she makes a new crown for your tooth.EndodonticsRoot Canal TreatmentYou can expect soreness after a root canal procedure for a few days. You should avoid chewing on the side of your mouth where the procedure was performed so you do not irritate the area and also to ensure that the temporary restorative material properly sets. You will also need to take an antibiotic to treat any remaining infection in your tooth. If you notice an increasing amount of pain or tenderness, a reaction to the medication, or the loss of the temporary restoration (filling) call your dentist immediately.ProsthodonticsDenturesGeneralTeeth WhiteningTooth Whitening is a cost effective and safe procedure to create a beautiful, healthy smile. Over the years, flouride is has been added to the whitening product. This reduces the risk of tooth and gum sensitivity.Cosmetic DentistryPreventiveTeeth CleaningYour teeth are not the only important part of your mouth. Your gums are essential to oral hygiene as well. We can provide periodontal cleanings and treatment, or refer you to one of our recommended specialists. Please let us know if you have any questions.DiagnosticOral Cancer ScreeningOral cancer screenings are a very important part of the dental visit for the patient. With the advances in modern technology, we are now able to pinpoint the start of a potential problem much earlier in its evolution. The ability to do so is extremely important in being able to treat any issues prior to them becoming a major irreversible problem.Dental ExaminationOral and Maxillofacial SurgeryOral SurgeryIt is important to follow instructions after you have oral surgery to ensure proper healing and to avoid complications. As a rule of thumb, you should always wait two hours after surgery before eating to let the anesthesia wear off. Trying to eat before this could result in soft tissue damage because you are not able to feel all of your mouth. The instructions found below are guidelines. After your surgery the doctor or dental assistant will give you full instructions on how to properly recover from surgery.Gum SurgeryOf Simi Valley, CA. We make beautiful smiles a reality. Quality dental care provided by periodontist Steven Kaminsky and staff at our beautiful CA office. Providing a wide array of dental procedures including dental implants, periodontics, crown lengthening, sinus augmentation, soft tissue grafting, bone grafting, scaling, root planing, gum surgery and much more. All of this available in our convenient periodontal office in Simi Valley, CA.Tooth ExtractionsWisdom teeth extractions are a fairly common procedure. Wisdom teeth often cause problems as they are trying to protrude through the gums. When a wisdom tooth is impacted, it means the tooth is coming in at an angle and not straight through the gum line. This can cause pain, the tooth can come in unevenly, or the tooth may only emerge partially.Bone GraftingBone grafting is where the jawbone is built up to accommodate a dental implant or other restorative device. Bone grafting is a common procedure that is used frequently for dental implants and other periodontal procedures. The bone used to graft is taken from a sample from the patient. Many times, the bone is taken from another area of the mouth when drilling takes place. The bone fragments are suctioned from the mouth and used for the graft. Cadaver bone fragments are also used. They are harvested by bone banks and are a very safe source for bone donation.PeriodonticsDeep CleaningWe Offer: Dental Cleanings, Prophylaxis,Periodontal Cleanings and Treament,Sedation, Root Planning, Deep Cleaning, Implants, Bone and Gum Grafts and Sinus Augmentation. Please click on links above for more information about any of these procedures.Periodontal SurgeryTo restore proper gum level and functionality a soft tissue graft can be performed. This is done by either removing soft tissue from the roof of the mouth, or repositioning healthy gum tissue from adjacent teeth. This procedure is very predictable and has a high success rate. This procedure should be performed before more serious problems develop and periodontal surgery is necessary.Send to PhoneKaminsky, Steven B, DDS2796 Sycamore Dr Ste 202, Simi Valley, CA 93065(805) 584-6225Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailKaminsky, Steven B, DDS2796 Sycamore Dr Ste 202, Simi Valley, CA 93065(805) 584-6225Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
