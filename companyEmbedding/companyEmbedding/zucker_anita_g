Jerry and Anita G. Zucker





Jerry and Anita Zucker are pillars of the Charleston Jewish Community and of the community at large. A list of awards, board appointments, and endowments too long to detail in this brief sketch accompany their name. Among the many causes that they are associated with are the South Carolina Research Institute, the MUSC Foundation for Research Development, Hotline of Charleston (crisis intervention), the South Carolina Aquarium, the Community Foundation, and the Trident United Way. They are also highly active in causes involving the advancement of Jews and Jewish life. Mr. Zucker serves on the board of the Hebrew Benevolent Society, the Hebrew Orphan Society, the American-Israel Chamber of Commerce and was past president of Synagogue Emanuel. Mrs. Zucker is a member of the Committee for the Holocaust Memorial at Marion Square, past board chair of the B’nai B’rith Youth Organization, and past president of both Synagogue Emanu-El Sisterhood and Women’s American ORT. Both are past presidents of the Charleston Jewish Federation and both are currently on the Advisory Board of the Jewish Studies Program at the College of Charleston. In their professional careers, the Zuckers are equally accomplished. A graduate of the University of Florida with a triple major BS degree in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry and an MS degree in Electrical Engineering, Mr. Zucker has spent over thirty years working in the fields of R&D, engineering, marketing, and operations management. He is currently the Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and founder of The InterTech Group, Inc., a company that creates and manufacturers a wide variety of polymer based products such as membranes and related composites. A leader in the innovation of fabrics, Mr. Zucker has over three hundred invention disclosures that have resulted in numerous patents worldwide. Mrs. Zucker also graduated from the University of Florida where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Education. She went on to earn her Master of Education degree at the University of North Florida in the subject of Educational Administration and Supervision. An elementary teacher herself for over ten years, Mrs. Zucker has been a leader in several educational organizations in the community. She is the immediate past chair of the Education Foundation of the Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce, a participant in the School to Work Task Force, and past vice-president of Education Council and the Business Education Partnership Committee. Currently, she serves as the Director of Community Relations for The Intertech Group, Inc. She is also a partner with Mr. Zucker in the Carolina Ice Palace, the South Carolina Stingrays, and the Sunfire Grill and Bistro. The Zuckers have been married for over thirty years and have three children. Their oldest son, Jonathan, is a graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology and is currently employed with a computer systems company. Their daughter Andrea, is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, and their youngest son, Jeffrey, is entering the ninth grade at Porter-Gaud.

College Home / Jewish Studies / About the Program
About the Yaschik/Arnold Jewish Studies Program



The Yaschik/Arnold Jewish Studies Program at the College of Charleston is the result of
the vision and generosity of Henry and Sylvia Vlosky Yaschik who began the
program in 1984 to honor their parents’ commitment to philanthropy and
community involvement. The matching endowment from Norman and Gerry Sue Arnold
has enabled the Program to significantly expand its offerings.

Jewish Studies at the College of Charleston benefits from having a strong and
active Hillel affiliate, our Jewish Student Union. The College of Charleston currently has nearly eight hundred
Jewish students and the JSU/Hillel is very active in arranging weekly Shabbat
services, dinners, and other events and celebrations to keep students
interested in Judaism engaged and interacting with one another.

Jewish Studies at the College also emphasizes community outreach as a hallmark of its program. By sponsoring numerous
events, lectures, discussions, and Sunday morning brunches that are open to the
public, the Program serves as a bridge between town and gown, between the
academic and broader South Carolina community.
In October 2002 the The Yaschik/Arnold Jewish Studies Program
moved into its new home, the Sylvia Vlosky Yaschik Jewish Studies Center at the corner of Glebe and Wentworth
Street. The Center houses the Jewish Student Union/Hillel, faculty members of
the Jewish Studies Program, the School of Languages, Cultures, and World
Affairs, and the Jewish Historical Society of South Carolina. It also offers
Arnold Hall, a state-of-the-art meeting and conference room where educational
and cultural programs are conducted, benefiting both students and the community
at-large. A forthcoming addition to the Jewish Studies Center expected to open
in September 2015, will double the size of the building, including additional
classroom space, offices, and a dining hall offering Kosher, Vegan and
Vegetarian options. 
The creation of the Sylvia Vlosky Yaschik Jewish Studies Center
at the College of Charleston is a significant milestone in the history of South
Carolina. We encourage all who are interested to become a part of it. Community
participation is the lifeblood of the Program. We have built our foundation on
the contributions of a small group of dedicated donors. To discuss giving
opportunities, contact Martin Perlmutter, Director of Jewish Studies, at 843.953.5682
or email perlmutterm@cofc.edu.
