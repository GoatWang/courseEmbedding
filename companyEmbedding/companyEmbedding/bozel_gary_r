Firm Profile











	Our firm was started on September 1, 1984, by Gary R. Bozel. Subsequently, Fredric R. Smith has joined our firm as a shareholder. The principals of the firm have experience in many facets of public accounting and private industry, inclusive of the areas discussed in this website. Their background is as follows:   	Gary R. Bozel, CPA, 37 years experience in public accounting, with a B.S. degree in Accounting from Towson State University. Serves as president of the firm including responsibility for the financial, marketing, personnel and staffing requirements. He also has directresponsibility for the performance and completion of client services, including direct supervision of firm personnel   	Fredric R. Smith, CPA, 34 years experience in both public accounting and private industry as controller. Graduated from Towson State University with a B.S. degree in Accounting. Responsibilities include marketing and staffing requirements. He also has direct responsibility for the performance and completion of client services, including direct supervision of firm personnel.   	As a medium sized firm, we take pride in the fact that we can provide a more personalized service to our clients. We feel that there are some distinct advantages associated with a firm our size. Our priorities rest with our clients and their needs. Many of our clients desire the ability to contact their accountant on short notice in order to handle various circumstances.   	They demand an attitude which follows an avenue of independence to third parties, but also as an advocate of the firm in advisory arrangements when necessary. The quality of our personnel is of primary importance since they deal directly with our clients, as well as minimal turnover, in order to provide a continuous relationship over a long-term period.  












Putting Our Quality To The Test

				We believe that it is not enough just to stress quality within our firm, we also need to test that quality and report the results of those tests to you, our client.

Firm Profile











	Our firm was started on September 1, 1984, by Gary R. Bozel. Subsequently, Fredric R. Smith has joined our firm as a shareholder. The principals of the firm have experience in many facets of public accounting and private industry, inclusive of the areas discussed in this website. Their background is as follows:   	Gary R. Bozel, CPA, 37 years experience in public accounting, with a B.S. degree in Accounting from Towson State University. Serves as president of the firm including responsibility for the financial, marketing, personnel and staffing requirements. He also has directresponsibility for the performance and completion of client services, including direct supervision of firm personnel   	Fredric R. Smith, CPA, 34 years experience in both public accounting and private industry as controller. Graduated from Towson State University with a B.S. degree in Accounting. Responsibilities include marketing and staffing requirements. He also has direct responsibility for the performance and completion of client services, including direct supervision of firm personnel.   	As a medium sized firm, we take pride in the fact that we can provide a more personalized service to our clients. We feel that there are some distinct advantages associated with a firm our size. Our priorities rest with our clients and their needs. Many of our clients desire the ability to contact their accountant on short notice in order to handle various circumstances.   	They demand an attitude which follows an avenue of independence to third parties, but also as an advocate of the firm in advisory arrangements when necessary. The quality of our personnel is of primary importance since they deal directly with our clients, as well as minimal turnover, in order to provide a continuous relationship over a long-term period.  












Putting Our Quality To The Test

				We believe that it is not enough just to stress quality within our firm, we also need to test that quality and report the results of those tests to you, our client.
