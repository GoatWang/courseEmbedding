	CHAIRMANS REVIEW





	 




	In this review last year I spoke of the ever increasing
	opportunities opening to Metal Storm across the international arena. Over the past 12 months highly prospective opportunities have been identified, and more importantly, appropriate strategies have been developed to ensure outcomes to the company
	and its shareholders will be maximised.




	 




	Metal Storms
	overriding goal is now to generate regular and sustainable early revenue streams from the most prospective of these opportunities. The Board and senior management some time ago identified that the most effective strategy to achieve this goal is to
	participate in an ever-widening range of government funded research and development (R&D) programs. Of foremost interest are situations where the company can conduct R&D development via funding which has been directly allocated under these
	programs. Significantly, our progress in this area over the past 12 months has been positive, and the company commenced 2003 with clear signs that additional revenue flow on from our expanding base of R&D programs will materialise as the year
	progresses.




	 




	Besides unlocking immediate income, securing
	additional R&D programs, particularly in the US, holds the strategic advantage of placing our technology squarely at the forefront of major defence development programs. It also positions the company on the radar screens of the leading
	international defence technology companies which are invariably involved with such programs. Over the past year Metal Storm has successfully augmented the range and extent of our existing R&D program commitments through securing a number of new
	funding arrangements. These arrangements, which open avenues for new applications of our technology, included four Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants from the US Department of Defense (DoD).




	 




	The SBIR program typifies the type of funding programs the company will be
	vigorously pursuing for the foreseeable future. The SBIR program will remain a high priority for Metal Storm over the coming 12 months, based on the fact that four of the five applications involving Metal Storm technology to date, have been
	successful. It is worth reinforcing that our progress as a company, and the future financial returns to our shareholders will be linked to the US defence sector, and in particular, the forging of ever closer strategic ties with the US DoD. The
	business opportunities open to breakthrough technology companies such as Metal Storm are clearly highlighted by the US $57 billion annual budget allocated by the DoD for defence research, development, test and evaluation, and procurement.




	 




	Importantly, our US office, which has now been operating for two
	years, is proving an increasingly valuable resource in leveraging new opportunities in this critical DoD market. The capability of our US operations was further bolstered in 2002 with the appointment of Mr Russell Zink as Senior Vice
	PresidentBusiness Development US; the addition of Lt. General Daniel Christman, President of the Kimsey Foundation, to the Board; and the welcome return of General Wayne Downing as a director. The Board recognises that current US DoD budgets
	for research, development and procurement remain understandably skewed in favour of US national companies. To ensure all future potential revenue opportunities in this market are maximised, the company is investigating the transition of its US
	subsidiary into a fully domiciled US entity. Shareholders will be kept abreast of any developments in this regard over coming months.




	 




	In a further strategic development designed to accelerate our progress with US R&D programs, in March this year the company announced the promotion of
	CCO, Chuck Vehlow, as Metal Storms new CEO. Chuck has extensive defence industry experience in taking R&D projects through to successful completion of procurement contracts, in leading negotiations of technology licence agreements, and
	mergers and aquisitions. His commercial experience with major US defence companies makes him well suited to lead the company forward.




	 




	Significantly, this key appointment now enables Metal Storms founder Mike ODwyer to focus his efforts solely on the critical areas of
	innovation and product development, under his new executive position of DirectorScientific Innovation. In this capacity Mike will be free to harness his considerable talents with the aim of moving our product into defence industry markets and
	providing key technical support for our US R&D program initiatives.




	 




	Further reflecting the companys increased focus on activities in the US and in recognition of US corporate




	 




	3






	governance best practice, two of Metal Storms long-standing directors Brett Heading and Peter Pursey
	resigned from the Board in March 2003. Both have made an invaluable contribution to the companys development, and on behalf of the Board and shareholders I thank them for their unswerving support of the company and its strategic objectives.
	Peter Pursey will continue to provide an important role for Metal Storm in an executive position.




	 




	Sincere thanks are also extended to our valued staff, both in Australia and the US. While we have increased the calibre and capacity of our senior management resources, the volume of our programs and
	other development work has substantially expanded. Our staff work energetically in furthering the companys progress, and their efforts should be applauded by all those with a vested stake in Metal Storm.




	 




	My fellow directors also deserve thanks for their unqualified commitment and
	for their selfless contributions of time, energy and wisdom. As mentioned previously, it is uncommon for a company of Metal Storms size to have a Board of such stature and experience, and this is a resource which will undoubtedly help drive
	our future success, particularly in the all-important US market.




	 




	To shareholders, our sincere thanks for your continued support and loyalty. Metal Storm is your company, and I, along with our management and fellow directors, remain committed to ensuring your investment and faith will be rewarded.

	CEOS REVIEW





	 




	The significant developments of the company

	

	s
	technology over the last 12 months are now leading to Metal Storm implementing supporting strategies that enhance the company

	

	s business in both Australia and the United States. To realise the value of these developments, Metal Storm is
	pursuing a number of mutually supporting strategies which will allow shareholders to measure our success. These strategies include:




	 






	 




	



	 



	The transition of Metal Storm, Inc., our US subsidiary into a US structure that allows it to pursue and capture R&D revenue directly for Metal Storm.






	 






	 




	



	 



	Securing a much greater number of funded Department Of Defence R&D programs, increasing revenue flows to Metal Storm and which produce application
	specific product.






	 






	 




	



	 



	Securing additional collaborative and commercial industry agreements with key defence companies globally.






	 






	 




	



	 



	Acquiring a small US-based defence company with the engineering, electronics and related skills to support the companys R&D and growth strategies.






	 






	 




	



	 



	Transition maturing programs to commercial products.






	 






	 




	



	 



	Re-shaping the companys Board and management in line with these strategies.






	 






	 




	



	 



	The Board is committed to advancing these strategies and may need to modify or adapt them in response to any changes identified in the defence environment.






	 




	To provide perspective on Metal Storms
	achievements this year, it is important to understand the nature of the defence industry, which is somewhat different to many other industry sectors in terms of how technology and weapons are developed and brought into service. Ideas that a weapon
	system can be developed one year and on the operational front line the next year are misplaced. Two key areas differentiate the defence industry. Firstly, there is one primary customer, the Department of Defence. Secondly, the approach to getting
	products into markets is a pull strategy not a broader push strategy which characterises many other industries. Pull means that defence identifies its ongoing weapon needs and then provides funded programs to
	ensure products are tailored to meet those specific needs. Companies are then pulled towards winning the contract to meet that need. By comparison, in many other industries, once a product meets regulatory standards it can be
	pushed into as many markets as possible.




	 




	Metal Storm
	has made exceptional progress for a small Australian company competing from a standing start in the international defence industry. Metal Storm is the only ASX listed Australian defence weapons company and there is no specialist defence analysis
	undertaken in the Australian investment market. In the US, the Metal Storm, Inc. office opened in 2001, adding the appropriate level of defence experienced executive staff in management and business development in 2002. Since that time the demand
	being placed on the company to respond to government defence agency programs has been unprecedented.




	 




	The achievements of the US office during this short period in terms of business development proposals, DoD contacts, exposure to Metal Storm technology, SBIR proposals submitted, and contracts won,
	have been significant for a company the size of Metal Storm competing in the very significant US defence industry sector.




	 




	Focus on US Defence Markets




	 





	Benefits of Independent US Structure





	 




	It has become increasingly apparent, particularly over the past 12 months, that there is an emerging opportunity in the US defence environment for Metal
	Storm to financially gain from the boost in funding for new generation defence R&D projects. As part of this revenue enhancing strategy, the company is examining ways to transition its US subsidiary, Metal Storm, Inc., to maximise the return
	value to Metal




	 




	5






	Storm shareholders. Importantly, such a move would allow Metal Storm, Inc. to contract directly with US
	government and defence agencies in accordance with US DoD requirements. This would significantly widen the net of R&D funding open to Metal Storm, consolidate greater congressional support for our technology and enhance our prospects for major,
	long-term commercial arrangements. Revenues derived in this manner would open income streams for Metal Storm to use in addition to shareholder funds as the company moves to become cash positive.




	 





	Value of R&D Path in US





	 




	The nature of product development in the defence industry is linked directly
	to funded R&D programs. In simple terms, these programs are determined by defence identifying what weapons (products) it needs to maintain cutting edge capabilities for its soldiers into the future. Having selected the capabilities
	required, the DoD fund R&D programs to ensure the capabilities are developed and supplied to the defence force. In the US alone, the 2003 budget allocated purely for defence Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, and Procurement is US$56.8
	billion.




	 




	Metal Storm is far better positioned in 2003 than at
	any time since the companys inception to achieve revenues from its unique ballistic technology. Revenues and investor returns are the measure of the companys path to success. Importantly, the base to secure ongoing revenue streams has
	been put in place over the last 12 months.




	 




	While licence
	agreements remain a priority objective for Metal Storm, it is the R&D programs that produce short term revenues and product that is ultimately the subject of license agreements, therefore it is vital that the company compete in the R&D
	program process. Government funded R&D programs are an overriding priority for Metal Storm at this stage of the companys development as they provide:




	 






	 




	



	 



	an immediate revenue stream from R&D programs for Metal Storm;






	 






	 




	



	 



	opportunities for close and highly productive collaboration with major, established defence companies, through formalised teaming agreements as well as expanding
	commercial and government agreements and pursuing further opportunities;






	 






	 




	



	 



	an end concept/demonstrator product for marketing;






	 






	 




	



	 



	ultimate contract production agreements following successful product marketing; and,






	 






	 




	



	 



	capitalise on the benefits which an appropriate merger and acquisition opportunity provides.






	 





	Revenue Streams





	 




	Success in winning R&D funding places Metal Storm technology into
	mainstream defence development programs. Metal Storm technology has already seen the company successful in four of the five Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs applied for and expect that this success will lead to more SBIR programs
	and even greater government funding and related product.




	 




	Metal
	Storms success to date in the R&D area has been very good. The company currently has seven active programs, all of which are in different stages of development.




	 




	Funded Programs Being Developed in 2003




	 




	The seven R&D programs in which Metal Storm is currently involved are as follows:




	 






	 




	



	 



	The

	Area Denial Weapon System

	(ADWS) program with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) will mature in 2003. Demonstrations of this 40mm pod
	system will follow and Metal Storm has already commenced developing the ADWS marketing plan. The ADWS weapon system will compete as an alternative to conventional land mines and has a wide range of additional applications including vehicle self
	defence and high value asset protection.






	 






	 




	



	 



	The

	Advanced Individual Combat Weapon

	(AICW) program with the DSTO. This program, which includes Tenix as a consortium member, is progressing well and is
	expected to mature next year. The weapon will combine a standard 5.56mm barrel with an electronically fired Metal Storm 40mm barrel which will have the capability to rapidly fire a range of 40mm munitions.






	 




	6






	 






	 




	



	 



	The

	National Institute of Justice Smartgun

	program. This program is currently being undertaken with the US Department of Justice to develop a handgun which
	operates only for the authorised user. This program takes Metal Storms VLe handgun and will provide in-depth analysis into the design, use, manufacturing processes and cost elements of delivering a production-safe firearm for the law
	enforcement community of the US, and potentially other friendly police and military forces internationally.






	 






	 




	



	 



	The

	Frill Neck Lizard Interception Technology SBIR

	program with the US Missile Defense Agency and StratCom International LLC. This program is
	designed to use StratComs stratospheric airship platforms with Metal Storms technology to improve kill vehicle reliability by enlarging its destructive volume.






	 






	 




	



	 



	The

	Stratospheric Missile Intercept Launch System SBIR

	program with the US Missile Defense Agency and StratCom International LLC. This program
	combines the StratCom strategic airships wide area detection and tracking capability with Metal Storm electronic ballistics.






	 






	 




	



	 



	The

	US Army SBIR

	program with Schappell Automation Corporation. This program provides for a lethal and less than lethal Metal Storm weapon pod system. The
	weapon can be hand held or mounted on a robot vehicle and has added value for use in peace keeping, homeland defence and anti-terrorism operations.






	 






	 




	



	 



	The

	US Navy SBIR

	program with Schappell Automation Corporation. This program provides for a weapon system for use on navy vessels for close in threats and to
	provide local security for berthed ships.






	 





	Value
	of SBIRs





	 




	Metal Storm technology has led to the successful
	award of four out of five SBIR grants applied for in 2002. SBIR grants are funded in phases, and provide approximately $300,000 in the first phase over a six month period, followed by up to $1.4M for phase II development. Metal Storm is moving to
	capture greater revenue for the company from these R&D programs. In addition, Metal Storm will be competing for a much larger number of SBIRs in 2003.




	 





	Transformational Weapon Systems





	 




	A common thread through many of these programs is an intentional movement from conventional mechanical systems through to next generation defence systems
	which are small, fast, inexpensive, numerous and network-centric. Metal Storm technology is by its very nature a natural fit with this transformation as it can be simply and effectively integrated with future military networked weapon systems. Metal
	Storm provides a lightweight, modular, variable calibre, weapon solution that fits with the mix n match weapon systems being sought for the future.




	 




	Metal Storms Own Build Program




	 




	    Adding Value




	 




	Metal Storm is not just reliant on securing defence programs to ensure its success. The company is pro-active in this area, concurrent with seeking DoD
	R&D programs and other revenue related agreements. The company is building a number of weapon systems to complement the development work being undertaken in existing programs. The build program will ensure Metal Storm has the
	required demonstrator weapon systems to compete for DoD programs which form part of the US defence budget. The weapons will also be used to accelerate the pace and direction of several current R&D programs.




	 




	The key company builds include:




	 






	 




	



	 



	the

	40mm multi barrel pod

	. Metal Storm is being asked to demonstrate its 40mm weapon system to meet specific DoD needs. This build allows Metal
	Storm to tailor, fire and demonstrate a weapon system that meets a defined DoD need, with a view to gaining revenue through key US funded defence programs. This particular build provides options for 16mm, 40mm or 60mm projectiles to be combined so
	as to extend the options for the applications of this multi calibre capability.






	 






	 




	



	 



	The

	repeatable access denial weapon system







	 




	(RADS) will be built and fired this year to fill an identified naval defence requirement. Metal Storm has




	 




	7






	 




	signed a teaming agreement
	with Curtiss Wright/VISTA Controls to participate in this program. Curtiss- Wright/VISTA Controls is a very prominent US defence company who has joined with Metal Storm to supply the weapon mount and electronics so that a complete integrated weapon
	system can be fired and demonstrated to key defence customers in 2003.




	 






	 




	



	 




	Metal Storm 2nd generation ammunition

	. In October 2002 the company announced the success of a new firing system which reduces external barrel wiring and
	leads, eliminates barrel ports and external primers, yet retains the infinitely variable rate of fire and multiple barrel capabilities that so clearly define Metal Storm technology. This new firing system is a significant advance of the
	companys ballistics and will be further developed as a key element of the companys build program in 2003.






	 




	The builds of these important demonstration systems result from Metal Storm identifying them as having potential application in the area of
	homeland security, force transformation, and future combat systems.




	 




	Metal Storm  Technical Data,




	Firings and Product Development




	 




	Metal Storm has built and fired over 16 weapon prototypes of various calibres
	ranging from 9mm to 40mm, which indicates the scale and depth of the technology. The company has also developed and expanded its technical and scientific data base which continues to grow at a rapid pace. The companys intellectual property has
	also grown in line with these technological developments. The independent research and development on the technology, undertaken by Metal Storm from its own resources, has so far resulted in 49 issued national patents and 284 patent applications in
	different countries and regions.




	 




	In the last 12 months Metal
	Storm has continued to refine its understanding of what armed forces are seeking as capability for their next generation of weapons. The two way dialogue which has been conducted with defence, who are the real end users of weapon
	systems, has enabled the company to explain first hand, the capabilities that can be achieved with Metal Storm technology. In turn, Metal Storm can now more confidently focus the development of its technology to closely fit with future defence
	requirements.




	 




	The outcome of this dialogue is that Metal Storm
	has identified a number of product development paths for the companys technology. To take advantage of these product opportunities, the company is independently completing the development, firing and demonstration of weapon systems which we
	expect can meet future defence needs. These independent product development efforts are additional to the very important work currently being conducted under existing government R&D agreements and programs, and expand the developing range of
	products which can springboard from our technology.




	 




	Technology
	Development Agreements




	 






	 




	



	 




	DSTO Research Agreement

	- 40mm, 60mm and .50 calibre high pressure development was conducted under this agreement with DSTO in Australia.






	 






	 




	



	 




	NICO Pyrotechnics

	 Metal Storm has an agreement with NICO relating to the commercial development of munitions from the ADWS program.






	 






	 




	



	 




	SAIC Research Agreement

	- This agreement has been signed for a further three years and is now a nonexclusive agreement, which allows Metal Storm to
	independently pursue other R&D opportunities.






	 






	 




	



	 




	StratCom Teaming Agreement

	 This agreement is designed to lead to the development and production of specific ballistic products that can be integrated
	into StratComs stratospheric airship. Two approved and funded SBIR programs are already being worked under this agreement.






	 






	 




	



	 




	Schappell Automation Corporation

	(SAC). This agreement is to develop approved and funded SBIR programs with the US Army and Navy.






	 





	Major Defence Relationship






	- Curtiss-Wright Corporation





	 




	8






	 




	Metal Storm is teaming with
	the US-based VISTA Controls, Inc., a subsidiary of Curtiss-Wright Corporation, to research, develop, construct and demonstrate a Repeatable Access Denial System (RADS) based on Metal Storms technology. VISTA Controls brings substantial
	expertise to this program through its market-leading experience in designing and producing world class fire control sub-systems and related software. The companys products have been utilised in numerous key US defence programs.




	 




	The RADS System is intended to be used as a new, revolutionary very close-in
	defence mechanism which offers protection against small, lethal, rapidly moving hostile threats, either on land or at sea.




	 




	The agreement, which was formalised in early 2003, will see the team working on completing a fully integrated RADS prototype for demonstration to defence
	agencies with a view to achieving production contracts. It is envisaged the demonstrations to various agencies will occur by the end of 2003.




	 




	The RADS demonstrator will incorporate Metal Storms new generation firing system with VISTAs stabilised weapons platform, acquisition sensor,
	integrating software and fully integrated user console.




	 




	Technical Support Working Group




	(TSWG) and Counter Terrorism




	The environment in the United States for the last year regarding the TSWG and its efforts to combat terrorism have been time consuming and most of the program efforts have been put on hold by the US
	Government.




	 




	While over 12,000 proposals were received by the
	TSWG in response to the US governments request for help after the 9/11 attacks, to date only a handful of proposals have actually been funded. We understand the process of getting responses back to those who presented TSWG and counter
	terrorism submissions is still in progress.




	 




	Metal Storm remains
	committed to providing the best uses of its unique and revolutionary technology for applications particularly suited to homeland security. We will continue to pursue other important R&D opportunities with a variety of US government services,
	different agencies, and major defence companies in the US.




	 




	Capital Additions




	In September 2002 Metal Storm raised an additional $9,192,755 in working capital through a private
	placement to institutional and private investors.




	 




	The private
	placement comprised the issue of 14,142,700 ordinary shares at 65 cents per share. Investors in the placement were also granted 14,142,700 options to acquire an identical number of ordinary shares at an exercise price of 65 cents per share between 3
	September 2002 and 6 September 2004.




	 




	In addition, existing
	shareholders were issued with a bonus option on a 1 for 20 basis exercisable through until 6 September 2004.




	 




	Total shares on issue if all bonus and placement options are exercised will be 477,848,672, which would raise a further $26,008,731 by 6 September 2004.




	 




	Board and Management Changes




	 





	New Directors and Executive





	 




	Lieutenant General Daniel W. Christman (US Army retired) was appointed in
	June 2002 as a non-executive director. General Christman is President and Executive Director of the Kimsey Foundation. Prior to his retirement from the military in 2001, he served in a number of high level positions during a 36 year career in the US
	Army and federal government, including Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point and as assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.




	 




	General Wayne A. Downing (US Army retired) was welcomed back to the company with his reappointment as a director in late
	2002. General Downing in October 2001 elected to vacate his directorship in view of his appointment by President Bush as National Director and Deputy National Security Advisor for




	 




	9






	 




	Combating Terrorism. As the
	Presidents principal advisor on anti-terrorism initiatives, General Downing was responsible for ensuring multi-agency co-ordination in the US war on terror, and for developing and executing a national anti-terrorism strategy. During his
	previous two years on the Board, General Downing made a major contribution to the progress of Metal Storm, and his reappointment is viewed as a major plus for the company as it continues to forge new, high level relationships within the US defence
	community.




	 




	Mr Russell Zink was appointed Senior Vice
	PresidentBusiness Development US in September 2002, with prime responsibility for generating R&D and production contracts, as well as securing teaming, partnering or licensing arrangements with major defence firms. With 25 years of defence
	experience in program management, marketing and business development, Mr Zink is well qualified to contribute to Metal Storms commercial success.




	 




	Ms Sylvie Moser-Savage was appointed Metal Storms Company Secretary in January 2003. Ms Moser-Savage has over sixteen years experience in
	accounting, finance and administration and her qualifications include a Bachelor of Commerce in accounting and an MBA in business law.




	 





	Retirement of Directors





	 




	As a consequence of the companys increasing focus on activities in the US and in recognition of US corporate governance best practice, two of Metal
	Storms directors retired from the Board in March 2003. Mr Peter Pursey has been a director since 1994 and Mr Brett Heading since 1998, and their efforts are much appreciated by the company.




	 





	Management Changes





	 




	As part of a major company restructure I was appointed Chief Executive
	Officer of Metal Storm in March 2003, taking over from the companys founder and inventor of Metal Storm technology, Mike ODwyer. Prior to this appointment I was the companys Chief Corporate Officer for almost 12 months. My
	background is in taking R&D projects through to successful completion of procurement contracts, and in leading negotiations of technology licence agreements, and mergers and acquisitions. As a former executive with Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas I
	have held positions in engineering, manufacturing, and distribution. This commercial experience with major US defence industry companies, combined with my defence R&D program experience, will I believe, enable me to effectively lead the company
	forward in the exciting period we are now entering.




	 




	Mike is now
	able to move his focus back to innovation and product development. His new role as Director  Scientific Innovation will allow him to work full time on advancing innovation and product development of Metal Storm technology. Mikes role is
	targeted at moving product into defence industry markets as well as technical support to the US R&D program effort.




	 




	Other management changes include Mr Peter Pursey, who stepped down as a director from the Board, and is continuing his important work for the company in
	the role of DirectorProgram Development. The company has also announced the imminent appointment of a new executive in Australia with responsibility for investor relations, business development and commercialisation opportunities in Australia,
	United Kingdom, Europe and Asia.




	 




	Metal Storm now has the
	critical mass in its management team to grow its revenue base, particularly from the US office, and to drive the companys technology into new areas of development by opening new sources of funding and strategic partnerships as well as
	expanding on existing relationships.

	Directors and
	Executives Remuneration




	 




	The Remuneration Committee
	reviews the remuneration packages of all Directors and executive officers on an annual basis and makes recommendations to the Board. Remuneration packages are reviewed with due regard to performance and other relevant factors. In order to retain and
	attract executives of sufficient calibre to facilitate the efficient and effective management of the companys operations, the remuneration committee seeks the advice of external advisers in connection with the structure of remuneration
	packages.




	 




	Remuneration packages contain the following key
	elements:




	 




	a) Salary/fees;




	b) Benefits  including the provision of motor vehicle, superannuation and health benefits; and




	c) Incentive schemes  including performance-related bonuses and share options under the executive and employee share option plan as disclosed in
	note 6 to the financial statements.

	Scope





	 




	We have audited the financial report of Metal Storm Limited for the financial
	year ended 31 December 2002, as set out on pages 25 to 50, including the Directors Declaration. The financial report includes the financial statements of Metal Storm Limited, and the consolidated financial statements of the consolidated entity
	comprising the company and the entities it controlled at years end or from time to time during the financial year. The companys Directors are responsible for the financial report. We have conducted an independent audit of the financial
	report in order to express an opinion on it to the members of the company.




	 




	Our audit has been conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards to provide reasonable assurance whether the financial report is free of material misstatement. Our procedures included examination, on a test basis, of
	evidence supporting the amounts and other disclosures in the financial report, and the evaluation of accounting policies and significant accounting estimates. These procedures have been undertaken to form an opinion whether, in all material
	respects, the financial report is presented fairly in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, other mandatory professional reporting requirements in Australia and statutory requirements, so as to present a view which is consistent with our
	understanding of the companys and the consolidated entitys financial position and performance as represented by the results of their operations and their cash flows.




	 




	The audit opinion expressed in this report has been formed on the above basis.




	 





	Audit Opinion





	 




	In our opinion, the financial report of Metal Storm Limited is in accordance
	with:




	 






	a)




	 




	the Corporations Act 2001, including:






	 






	 




	i.




	 




	giving a true and fair view of the companys and consolidated entitys financial position as at 31 December 2002 and of their performance for the year
	ended on that date; and






	 






	 




	ii.




	 




	complying with Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001; and






	 






	b)




	 




	other mandatory professional reporting requirements in Australia.

	Item 3. Key Information




	A. Selected Financial Data



	     The following table presents our selected financial information at the dates and for each of

	     Commencing with fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, Australian companies such

	Standards (A-IFRS). This annual report is prepared in accordance with International Financial
	Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards
	Board.


	     Our financial statements for 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 have been prepared in Australian
	dollars and in accordance with A-IFRS and also comply with IFRS as issued by the International
	Accounting Standards Board. For the purpose of comparability, the 2004 financial information
	included in this annual report has been prepared on a basis to comply with IFRS.


	     Our selected financial data set forth below are presented in accordance with IFRS. Income
	statement data for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and the balance sheet data as
	at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 have been derived from our audited financial statements, which

	D. Risk Factors




	There is substantial doubt regarding Metal Storms ability to continue as a going concern.



	     In order to meet Metal Storms objectives to develop, manufacture and market commercial
	products effectively, we will require additional funding until such time that product sales are of
	sufficient volume to generate positive cash flows from operations. This has taken longer and has
	cost more than originally anticipated. Based on the expected levels of operating expenditures, in
	order to continue its operations, Metal Storm will require additional sources of capital. As of
	June 17, 2009 Metal Storm had approximately A$1.6 million in cash. Without a capital injection, Metal Storm will exhaust
	its resources at the end of July. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise
	sufficient capital to continue our operations. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to obtain
	sufficient financing to continue to fund our current operations, we will be required to
	significantly reduce or cease operations altogether. Accordingly, there exists a substantial doubt
	about Metal Storms ability to continue as a going concern.


	     Furthermore, as discussed below, we raised A$27.5 million in September 2006 through the
	issuance of convertible notes that mature in September 2009. We do not believe that we will have
	sufficient financing to pay the holders of the convertible notes at maturity in September 2009. In
	mid-June 2009 we sent a proposal to holders of the convertible notes (Noteholders) to be voted on
	at a special meeting on July 31, 2009 that, if approved, would:





	 



	



	 


	extend the maturity date of the convertible notes until September 1, 2011; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	grant Noteholders the option to exchange their convertible notes, which are
	unsecured, for the same principal amount of secured convertible notes.





	     The secured notes would have the benefit of a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the
	company, but they would not bear interest. The Noteholders who elect to hold the secured notes
	will also receive five (5) options for each seven (7) secured notes that they hold. These options
	have an exercise price of A$0.001 and expire on 1 September 2011.


	     Under the Convertible Note Trust Deed (Trust Deed) entered into with ANZ Executors & Trustee
	Company Limited (Trustee) on July 11, 2006 which governs the convertible notes, an affirmative
	vote of 75% of the holders of the outstanding convertible notes is required to effect an amendment
	extending the maturity date. Accordingly, the aforementioned proposal to Noteholders requires an
	affirmative 75% vote. The proposal was formulated upon discussions with Harmony Investment Fund
	Limited (Harmony), the largest holder of our convertible notes. As of June 17, 2009, Harmony
	held approximately 66% of the outstanding convertible notes and they have indicated that they will
	vote in favour of the proposal. There can be no assurance, however, that we will obtain the
	necessary number of votes from our Noteholders to approve the proposal and extend the maturity
	date.


	     In addition to the required affirmative vote of 75% of the holders of the convertible notes
	discussed above, the Australian Securities Exchange (the ASX), on which our ordinary shares are
	listed, has determined that a vote of the shareholders of Metal Storm is also required in order to
	effect an extension of the maturity date of the convertible notes. A shareholder meeting will also
	be held on July 31, 2009 to seek their approval for, among other items, the extension of the
	convertible notes and the issuance of the options to Noteholders who elect to hold the secured
	notes. Each matter is put to the shareholders for consideration as a separate resolution. A vote of
	greater than 50% of holders of ordinary securities is required to pass each resolution. There can
	be no assurance that a majority of our shareholders will approve the resolution extending the
	maturity date of the convertible notes. The approval of the Noteholders to the extension of the
	maturity date is conditioned upon shareholders also approving the extension or a subsequent
	determination by the ASX that shareholder approval is not necessary. If we fail to obtain
	shareholder approval and the ASX does not subsequently determine that shareholder approval is
	unnecessary, our efforts to extend the maturity of the existing convertible notes will fail and we
	will require outside funding to repay our obligations under the convertible notes at maturity as
	the principal amount of the convertible notes greatly exceeds our current cash reserves. It is
	highly unlikely that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to pay the convertible notes on
	their existing maturity date and , accordingly, substantial doubt exists about our ability to
	continue as a going concern.

	     In addition to seeking finance for our current operations and pursuing an extension of the
	maturity date for our convertible notes, we recently pursued a small injection of capital from our
	current shareholders in Australia and New Zealand through a share purchase plan (the SPP) as part
	of an overall restructuring of our finances. The SPP opened on June 15, closed July 3 and
	subscriptions for approximately A$2.6 million of shares were received. The settlement of the SPP,
	however, is conditioned on an affirmative vote by the holders of our convertible notes and holders
	of our ordinary shares to extend the maturity date and there can be no assurance that the maturity
	date of the convertible notes will be extended.


	     Even if we are able to extend the maturity date of the convertible notes and successfully
	consummate the capital raising of $A2.6 million through the SPP, we will still require financing in
	the future to continue our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise
	sufficient capital to continue our operations. If we do not have reasonable grounds to believe
	that we will be successful in our efforts to obtain sufficient financing to continue to fund our
	operations, we will be required to appoint an administrator.


	     Overall, if we are unable to effect any of the parts of our restructuring plan, there would be
	substantial doubt as to whether Metal Storm would continue as a going concern and, therefore,
	whether Metal Storm would realize the value of its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the
	normal course of business and at the amounts in the financial statements. No adjustments have been
	made to the financial statements relating to the recoverability and classification of the assets
	carrying amounts or classification of liabilities that might be necessary should Metal Storm not
	continue as a going concern.



	We may be required to redeem convertible notes before maturity, which redemption could cause us to
	become insolvent.



	     In September 2006, we raised A$27.5 million under a rights offer of unsecured convertible
	notes (Rights Offer) in Australia and New Zealand. The convertible notes mature in September 2009
	at which time Metal Storm must repay the face value of any convertible notes unless a Noteholder
	has elected to convert them into ordinary shares. In connection with the Rights Offer, Metal Storm
	entered into the Trust Deed. On the occurrence of a default event under the Trust Deed, Metal Storm
	must, if required by the Trustee, redeem all convertible notes outstanding by payment of the face
	value of the convertible note together with all accrued but unpaid interest.


	     In the event of early redemption of the convertible notes, Metal Storm would have to raise
	funds to meet such obligations. It is likely that it will not be able to do so in a timely manner,
	or at all, in which case Metal Storm could become insolvent.



	We may need additional capital and may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms,
	if at all.



	     Metal Storm will likely require additional capital by the third quarter of 2009 to fund
	product development programs and/or to pay our convertible note debt. In addition, we may seek to
	exploit business opportunities that will require us to raise additional capital from equity or debt
	sources. In particular, developing and commercializing new technology and products to develop our
	business could require a significant commitment of additional resources that could, in turn,
	require us to obtain additional funding. We may also require further funds to pursue regulatory
	clearances, prosecute and defend our intellectual property rights, develop marketing capabilities
	and fund operating expenses.


	     Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including
	market conditions and our operating performance. These factors may render the timing, amount, terms
	and conditions of additional financing unattractive for us. The sale of additional equity or
	convertible debt securities would result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Additional debt
	could result in increased expenses and could result in further covenants that would restrict our
	operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to raise any required funding or capital on
	favorable terms or at all. If we do not have reasonable grounds to believe that we will be
	successful in our efforts to obtain sufficient financing to continue to fund our operations, we
	will be required to appoint an administrator.


	     We have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception. We had net losses of
	A$10.7 million, A$10.0 million and A$15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
	2006 respectively. We expect to incur additional operating losses over the next few years. Our
	profitability is dependent on our ability, alone or with others, to complete the successful product
	engineering of our technology, obtain any required regulatory clearances, and commercialize our
	products. We cannot be certain if or when we will achieve profitability or positive cash flow.



	We are in the product engineering phase and do not yet have any product for sale based on our core
	technology.



	     Most of our technology requires further research, development, testing and possibly regulatory
	approval prior to any commercial sales. Metal Storm does not currently derive any revenue from the
	commercial sale of any applications of our technology. We cannot be sure of the extent to which the
	technology or any products we develop will be able to penetrate the potential markets for defense
	or commercial applications or gain market acceptance.



	4









	Table of Contents






	We cannot be certain of market acceptance of our technology or the rate of any market acceptance.



	     We plan to develop our technology for use in a range of military, law enforcement,
	counter-terrorism and commercial applications. It is not yet known whether our technology will be
	accepted in the market for any of these applications or the rate of any market acceptance. The
	degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including the receipt and timing of
	any regulatory approvals, the establishment and demonstration of the need, safety, efficacy and
	cost-effectiveness of our technology and products, and our technologys advantages over existing
	technologies. It is not yet known whether we will be able to fully develop or commercialize our
	technology and products, even if they perform successfully in research and evaluation trials.



	We are dependent on retaining key personnel.



	     There is competition among defense development companies for qualified technical employees and
	retaining and attracting qualified individuals is critical to our success. The responsibility of
	overseeing day to day management and the strategic management of Metal Storm is concentrated
	amongst a small number of key people. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a
	material adverse effect upon Metal Storm, as we may not be able to recruit replacements for the key
	personnel within a short timeframe.



	Any catastrophic event involving our technology could adversely affect Metal Storms reputation.



	     Any catastrophic accident involving the testing of our technology or the use of products that
	are developed utilizing our technology could severely damage Metal Storms reputation, marketing
	ability and results of operations.



	We work on research and development programs.



	     Some of our technology applications progress in collaboration with U.S. and Australian
	government defense research and development program support. We have obtained such support from
	both the U.S. and Australian governments. We have entered into agreements with the departments of
	defense of these countries that provide conditions to the funding of research and development
	grants. For example, generally we are required to achieve certain milestones with respect to the
	development of our technology prior to receiving payment under the agreements. In addition, we have
	granted exclusive licensing rights under certain agreements and we are also in some circumstances
	required to repay money received under the agreements. Further, although the Australian programs
	provided for funding contributions by consortium members, we have received no direct funds from
	these programs. If Metal Storm is unable to continue existing research and development programs or
	to enter into new research and development programs, if there is a decrease of available funding in
	respect of such programs, or if the U.S. or Australian governments choose to exercise powers
	available to them under export control regulations to control the export of Metal Storm technology
	or products developed from it, this could have a material adverse affect on us.



	There are some limitations relating to our technology.



	     In its usual configuration, the Metal Storm technology stacks a number of projectiles in each
	barrel and a quantity of propellant or gunpowder is located in a space that separates the
	projectiles. As a result, barrels may be longer and therefore heavier to hold the additional
	propellant that may be required to support our technology. For these reasons, the development risk
	of our technology increases as the operating pressure of the system increases. Furthermore, unlike
	conventional gun systems, which are mechanical in operation, our technology is reliant on a 100%
	electronic fire control system. Electronic systems may be adversely affected by electromagnetic
	interference. Failure to design the electronics systems to minimize susceptibility to natural or
	man-made electromagnetic interference may result in unplanned and potentially catastrophic failure
	of our technology. The extent to which these factors will affect the development of and the
	practical applications of our technology is uncertain.



	We may not have adequate protection for our intellectual property.



	     We principally rely upon patents, trade secret, copyright and contract law to protect our
	proprietary technology. We cannot be certain that any protective measures we have taken will be
	adequate to protect our proprietary technology. Many of the laws of foreign countries treat the
	protection of proprietary rights differently from, and may not protect our proprietary rights to
	the same extent as do, laws in Australia, the United States and Patent Co-operation Treaty
	countries. In addition, the laws of many countries, including Australia and the United States,
	provide governments with the ability to control or restrict the use of defense technologies.


	     Patent matters involve complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, we cannot predict the
	availability and breadth of claims sought in relation to patents. Statutory differences in
	patentable subject matter may limit the protection we can obtain for some of our inventions, or
	prevent us from obtaining patent protection, which could materially adversely affect our business,
	financial condition and results of operations.

	Table of Contents





	     Additionally, the enforceability of a patent is dependent on a number of factors, which may
	vary between jurisdictions. These factors may include the novelty of the invention, the requirement
	that the invention not be obvious in light of prior art, including prior use or publication of the
	invention, the utility of the invention and the extent to which the patent clearly describes the
	best method of working the invention.


	     While we have obtained and continue to seek patent protection for our technology, we cannot be
	certain that:





	 



	



	 


	any of the pending or future patent applications filed by us or on our behalf will be
	approved;




	 




	 



	



	 


	we will develop any additional proprietary products or processes that are patentable; or




	 




	 



	



	 


	third parties will not independently develop similar products or processes, duplicate any
	of the products or processes we have or are developing relating to our technology, or design
	around the patents we own with competitive advantages.





	     Furthermore, we cannot be certain that patents held by third parties will not prevent the
	commercialization of products incorporating our technology or that third parties will not challenge
	or seek to narrow, invalidate or circumvent any of our issued, pending, or future patents.



	Protecting our proprietary technology from infringement by others may affect our business.



	     We may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents or to determine the scope and validity
	of third party proprietary rights. This could result in substantial costs to us and divert efforts
	from our business. We may have to participate in opposition proceedings before the Australian
	Patent Office or a foreign patent office, or in interference proceedings declared by the U.S.
	Patent and Trademark Office, to determine priority of invention of patent applications filed by
	competitors. Any such litigation, interference or opposition proceeding, regardless of the outcome,
	could be expensive and time consuming and adverse determinations in any such proceedings could
	prevent us from developing, manufacturing or commercializing our technology or products, which
	could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
	operations.


	     In addition to patent protection, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, know-how and
	proprietary technological innovation and expertise, which are protected, in part, by
	confidentiality agreements with our employees, advisers and consultants. We cannot be certain that
	these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that
	our unpatented proprietary intellectual property will not otherwise become known or independently
	discovered by competitors. We also cannot be certain that relevant inventions will not be developed
	by persons not bound by such agreements.



	We may be subject to patent infringement claims from our competitors and other third parties.



	     Our commercial success may depend, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing on patents
	issued to others. Although we are not aware of any action or threatened action alleging patent
	infringement or improper use of proprietary information by us, if we have to defend any such claims
	we could incur substantial costs and our management resources could be diverted. This could have a
	material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	     If we were found to be infringing any third party patents, we could be required to pay
	damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. We cannot be
	certain that if we required licenses for patents held by third parties that they would be made
	available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. To the extent that we required such licenses for
	the development of our technology and we were unable to obtain them, we could be foreclosed from
	the development, manufacture or commercialization of technology or products requiring such
	licenses, or encounter delays in product introductions while attempting to design around such
	patents. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
	of operations.



	The Australian and U.S. governments may take action on patent applications and patents.



	     Under the provisions of the Patents Act 1990 (Commonwealth of Australia) (Patents Act), the
	Commonwealth of Australia has the right to exploit, or authorize others in writing to exploit, an
	invention for the services of the Commonwealth of Australia at any time after a patent application
	has been made. The remuneration and terms for exploitation are determined by agreement between the
	person entitled to the benefit of the patent application, or the persons nominee, and the
	Commonwealth of Australia. If there is no agreement, the determination is made by a prescribed
	court.


	     Under the provisions of the Patents Act, a patent or a patent application may also be acquired
	by the Commonwealth of Australia. In that instance, all rights in the patent, or the patent
	application, vest in the Commonwealth of Australia. Compensation must be paid in an amount to be
	agreed between the person entitled to be compensated, and the Commonwealth of Australia. If there
	is no agreement, the amount of compensation is determined by a prescribed court. As such an
	acquisition clearly involves an acquisition of property, the terms of that acquisition must be
	just, within the meaning of the Australian Constitution.

	Table of Contents





	     The Patents Act also allows the Commissioner of Patents, on the direction of the relevant
	Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, to prohibit or restrict the publication of information
	about the subject matter of a patent application. While any such order is in force, the complete
	specification of the application is not open to public inspection, acceptance must not be notified
	and a patent must not subsequently be granted. As a result, if the Commonwealth of Australia were
	to take action on one or more of our patents under the Patents Act, we may not be able to
	exclusively commercially exploit such patents in the way we currently intend. Additionally, the
	compensation we receive in connection with such actions may be significantly less than what we
	would receive if we were to retain full rights to the patent.


	     Under the U.S. Patent Act, the U.S. government may use an invention described in and covered
	by a U.S. patent without license of the owner. Where this occurs, the owners only remedy is an
	action against the U.S. government for the recovery of reasonable and entire compensation for the
	use and manufacture of the invention.


	     Under the U.S. Patent Act, if one of the authorized offices of various government agencies
	identified under the Act holds the opinion that publication or disclosure of an invention described
	in a patent application would be detrimental to the national security, the Commissioner of Patents
	being so notified shall order that the invention be kept secret and also withhold the publication
	of the application or the grant of a patent for such period as the national interest requires. The
	owner of an application that has been placed under a secrecy order shall have the right to appeal
	from the order to the Secretary of Commerce. An applicant whose patent is withheld shall have the
	right to apply for compensation for the damage caused by the order of secrecy.


	     It is also possible that countries other than Australia or the United States could take action
	that may impact upon our patents and patent applications. Any actions on our patents by the
	governments of Australia, the United States or other countries could affect our ability to protect
	our technology and our ability to effectively commercialize our technology. This could have a
	material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



	We are obligated to perform some construction contracts at a fixed price, which could turn out to
	be less than our costs.



	     We perform systems integration work for third parties under contracts. Several of our
	construction contracts are bid on a fixed price basis. As such, there is inherent risk that our
	actual costs to perform the contracted job could exceed the agreed upon fixed price, which could
	have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



	There are potential adverse effects from competition and technological changes.



	     The defense industry market is highly competitive and can be subject to significant
	technological change. Large, well-established defense companies are engaged in research and
	development and have considerably greater resources than Metal Storm to develop applications for
	defense technology. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not succeed in developing
	technologies and products that are more effective than any which we are developing, or which would
	render our technology and products obsolete or non-competitive. Much of the research being
	conducted on defense technology is funded principally by government agencies in the United States.
	We compete with such other companies for government resources allocated to such research and
	development projects. There are existing defense companies that may have target markets similar to,
	if not the same as, ours. Such companies may be developing their own technology and products, which
	may ultimately compete with ours. This could have a material adverse effect on our business,
	results of operations and financial condition.


	     The defense industry market is characterized by changing technology, evolving industry
	standards, introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands. These market
	characteristics are exacerbated by the nature of the defense industry. Accordingly, Metal Storms
	success may depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies, our ability to adapt our
	technology to evolving industry standards, and to continually improve the performance, features and
	reliability of our technology, in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and
	competitive product offerings. If we fail to adapt to such changes and evolution, this could have a
	material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.


	     There are existing companies that may have target markets similar to, if not the same as,
	ours. Such companies may be developing their own technology and products, which may ultimately
	compete with ours. Our technology may be perceived by our competitors as threatening existing
	markets and therefore may be resisted. As a result, we cannot be certain that we will be successful
	in commercializing our technology or that we will be able to penetrate the potential markets for
	our products.



	There may be reductions or changes in military expenditures.



	     We anticipate that our primary customers will be the U.S. and Australian governments, the
	agencies of the U.S. and Australian governments Departments of Defense, the U.S. Department of
	Justice and the global defense industry. Our markets may be limited by U.S. and Australian
	government requirements pertaining to foreign markets. We also cannot predict future levels of
	defense spending with certainty and declines in military expenditures could materially adversely
	affect our results of operations
	and financial condition. The impact of possible



	7









	Table of Contents





	declines in the level of defense procurement
	on our results of operations and financial condition will depend upon the timing and size of the
	changes and our ability to mitigate their impact with new business, business consolidations or cost
	reductions. The loss or significant curtailment of a material program in which we participate could
	have a material adverse affect on our future results of operations and financial condition.



	We are subject to government regulation.



	     We are developing products for sale in the defense and law enforcement industries, which are
	subject to extensive regulation. This regulation may adversely affect our business. For example,
	products incorporating our technology are required to undergo rigorous testing as well as extensive
	regulatory approval processes. These processes take significant time and require us to expend
	substantial resources. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the
	development and commercialization of our technology and products and could have a material adverse
	effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.


	     We will need to obtain operating licenses and permits. Such licenses and permits may be
	difficult to obtain and retain depending on government policies, customs, changes in political
	leadership, and other factors. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be in compliance with
	any such licenses or permits or any other governmental requirements. If we fail to comply with any
	such licenses or permits or any other governmental requirements it could have a material adverse
	effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	     Products to be manufactured using our technology may also be subject to government regulation,
	including regulations governing use, specification, manufacture, handling, disposal, packaging,
	labeling, transport and import/export in Australia, the United States and in each of the countries
	into which such products are intended to be exported. See Item 4B Information on Metal Storm -
	Business OverviewRegulation for a discussion of government regulations that we are subject to in
	Australia and the United States.


	     Compliance with government regulation requires us to allocate resources to monitoring
	compliance, training, security of goods, reporting and reviewing legislative and other changes to
	ensure we are complying with the relevant regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
	Failure to comply with government regulations could result in our inability to sell our products in
	those jurisdictions.



	There are risks inherent in U.S. government contracts.



	     We expect that a significant portion of our sales will be associated with contracts and
	programs for the U.S. government in which there are significant inherent risks, including risks
	particular to the defense industry. The primary risks relate to:





	 



	



	 



	Contract Termination






	     Any contracts we may enter into with the U.S. government may be subject to termination by it
	either for its convenience or in the event of a default by us as the contractor. Termination for
	convenience provisions may only provide for the recovery by us of costs incurred or committed,
	settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. Termination for default
	provisions may render us liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring
	undelivered items from another source.





	 



	



	 



	Loss of Appropriations






	     U.S. government contracts are usually conditional upon the continuing availability of U.S.
	Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a
	fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at
	the outset of a major program, the contract is usually partially funded, and additional monies are
	normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by
	Congress for future fiscal years. In addition, most U.S. government contracts are subject to
	modification in the event of changes in funding. Any failure by Congress to appropriate additional
	funds to any program in which we participate or any contract modification as a result of funding
	changes could materially delay or terminate such program and therefore have a material adverse
	effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.





	 



	



	 



	Procurement and Other Related Laws and Regulations






	     If we enter into contracts with the U.S. government we may be subject to extensive and complex
	U.S. government procurement laws and regulations. These laws and regulations provide for ongoing
	U.S. government audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance and administration. Failure
	to comply, even inadvertently, with these laws and regulations and with laws governing the export
	of munitions and other controlled products and commodities, and any significant violations of any
	other U.S. federal law, could subject us to potential contract termination, civil and criminal
	penalties, and under certain
	circumstances, suspension and debarment from future U.S. government contracts



	8









	Table of Contents





	for a
	specified period of time. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
	operations or financial condition.





	 



	



	 



	Protection of Proprietary Technology






	     If we enter into U.S. government contracts, and in particular contracts that involve
	modification or development of our technology or products, we may face a risk that the U.S.
	government would seek to assert far-reaching rights to our inventions and technology. Such
	assertions could compromise our competitive position.





	 



	



	 



	Changes and Adjustments






	     The U.S. government often directs changes in contract work, particularly in the case of
	products under development. Recovery of additional costs and profit attributable to the changed
	work may require a protracted effort that could adversely affect our cash flow.





	 



	



	 



	Competitive Bidding and Domestic Preferences






	     We may need to obtain military contracts through either competitive bidding or sole-sourced
	procurement. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in having our bids accepted or, if
	accepted, that awarded contracts will be profitable. We may be disadvantaged in competing for
	contracts by laws and regulations that give preference to firms that offer products manufactured in
	the United States or to small or minority-owned businesses. We may also be disadvantaged by
	regulations limiting the access of non-U.S. citizens to classified information of the U.S.
	government or the use or storage of such information at facilities outside the United States. We
	have organized Metal Storm Inc., our U.S. subsidiary, as a U.S. owned small business, as defined
	by applicable U.S. Department of Defense requirements, which allows Metal Storm Inc. to contract
	directly with U.S. government and defense agencies in accordance with U.S. Department of Defense
	requirements. Our other U.S. subsidiary, Metal Storm U.S.A. Limited, is 100% owned by us and was
	formed to contract with both U.S. government agencies as well as non-government defense
	contractors.


	     Additionally, inherent in either procurement process is the risk that if a bid is submitted
	and a contract is subsequently awarded, actual performance costs may exceed the projected costs
	upon which the submitted bid or contract price was based. To the extent that actual costs exceed
	the projected costs on which bids or contract prices were based, our potential profitability could
	be materially adversely affected.



	We may have product liability exposure in the future.



	     The testing, marketing and sale of our technology may result in products that are used in
	situations that may result in serious, permanent bodily injury, or even death, to those involved. A
	person injured in connection with the use of our products may bring legal action against us to
	recover damages on the basis of claims including personal injury, wrongful death, negligent design,
	dangerous product or inadequate warning. We may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations
	of misuse of our products. If successful, personal injury, misuse and other claims could have a
	material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no
	assurance that adequate or necessary insurance coverage will be available or will be obtained to
	limit our product liability exposure.



	We may be dependent on third party manufacturers, suppliers and teaming partners.



	     We currently do not have any manufacturing capabilities. In the future, we may be required to
	enter into contracting arrangements with third party manufacturers in order to manufacture our
	products for large-scale, later-stage testing. If we need to use a third party to manufacture all,
	or a portion of, our products we cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into satisfactory
	arrangements with such contract manufacturers. If, at any time, we are unable to maintain or expand
	as necessary or contract for manufacturing on acceptable terms, our manufacturing capabilities and
	our ability to conduct tests with our products will be adversely affected, resulting in delays in
	submissions for regulatory approvals.


	     We may also need to develop manufacturing resources, enter into collaborative arrangements
	with other parties who have established manufacturing capabilities, or have third parties
	manufacture our products on a contractual basis. We cannot be certain that we will have access on
	acceptable terms to the extensive additional financing, qualified personnel and relevant
	technologies that would be required in order for us to scale-up production and develop effective
	commercial manufacturing processes and technologies, or that we will be able to enter into
	collaborative or contractual arrangements on acceptable terms with parties that will meet our
	requirements in respect of quality, quantity and time lines.

	     In addition, we may be dependent upon suppliers of parts for our projectile launching systems
	and teaming partners with whose weapons platforms our systems may be integrated. Any failure in
	delivery or performance by these third parties could cause a delay in the development or
	commercialization of our systems.



	Our share price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.



	     The ordinary shares of Metal Storm are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and our
	American Depositary Shares, also referred to ADSs, are registered and trade on the over-the-counter
	(OTC) market in the United States. As a result, our share price will be subject to the numerous
	influences that may affect both the broad trend in the local and international share market and the
	share prices of individual companies and sectors. Investors should recognize that the price of
	ordinary shares and options in Metal Storm may fall as well as rise. Our share price has been and
	is likely to continue to be volatile, particularly due to our relatively limited trading volume.
	Our share price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, including:





	 



	



	 


	variations in our anticipated or actual operating results;




	 




	 



	



	 


	sales of substantial amounts of our shares;




	 




	 



	



	 


	announcements about us or about our competitors, including new products;




	 




	 



	



	 


	litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or
	those of our competitors;




	 




	 



	



	 


	governmental regulation and legislation;




	 




	 



	



	 


	our available cash resources or the need to seek additional funding through public or
	private equity or debt financings; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	changes in securities analysts estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet
	analysts expectations.





	     Many of these factors are beyond our control.


	     Our major shareholder, James Michael ODwyer, beneficially owns 26% of Metal Storms ordinary
	shares. In the past, he has indicated an intention to sell approximately one-half of his
	shareholding to someone who would likely be a long term investor. Any such sale and any significant
	subsequent resales may cause volatility in our share price. In addition, a significant number of
	shares could be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes and the exercise of options issued
	to Noteholders in September 2006. See Item 7A  Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions
	 Major Shareholders.



	We are not currently paying dividends and we may not pay dividends in the future.



	     Until we make a profit, our directors will not be able to recommend that any dividends be paid
	to our shareholders. Our directors will not resolve a formal dividend policy for us until we
	generate profits. Our future profitability and cash flow will depend on future earnings, as well as
	our working capital requirements. Our directors current intention is to reinvest our income in the
	continued development and operation of our business. We may continue to generate operating losses
	on research projects until such time as our technology, or products resulting from research into
	our technology, are successfully commercialized. There are a number of factors beyond our control
	and our directors control, for example changes in technology, market competition, exchange rate
	fluctuations and governmental policy, which may also impact on our profitability and ability to pay
	dividends.



	We have been, and likely will be again, classified as a passive foreign investment company for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes.



	     We believe that we were a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008 but not in 2001 or 2007. Metal Storm
	could be a PFIC again in 2009.


	     For any U.S. holder that owns our ADSs or ordinary shares during any taxable year in which we
	qualify as a PFIC, our status as a PFIC could, among other things, have a material effect on the
	timing and character of income and gain, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with respect to the
	holders ADSs or ordinary shares. It could also have a material adverse effect on the amount of
	U.S. federal income tax owed by the U.S. holder as a result of owning, receiving dividends on or
	disposing of ADSs or ordinary shares. See Item 10E Additional Information  TaxationU.S.
	Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsPassive Foreign Investment Company Status for a more detailed
	description of the U.S. tax consequences of owning stock in a PFIC.


	     U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of owning and
	disposing of ADSs or ordinary shares, including the desirability of making, and the availability
	of, certain elections with respect to our ADSs or ordinary shares. Metal Storm provides no advice
	on your taxation matters. The above should not be taken as advice by the reader of this document.



	Our ADS holders are not shareholders and do not have shareholder rights.



	     The Bank of New York Mellon, as depositary, delivers our ADSs, on our behalf. Our ADS holders
	will not be treated as shareholders and do not have the rights of shareholders. The depositary will
	be the holder of the shares underlying our ADSs.

	Table of Contents





	Holders of our ADSs will have ADS holder rights. A deposit agreement among us, the depositary
	and our ADS holders, and the beneficial owners of ADSs, sets out ADS holder rights as well as the
	rights and obligations of the depositary. New York law governs the deposit agreement and the ADSs.


	     Our ADS holders do not have the same voting rights as our shareholders. Shareholders are
	entitled to our notices of general meetings and to attend and vote at our general meetings of
	shareholders. At a general meeting, every shareholder present (in person or by proxy, attorney or
	representative) and entitled to vote has one vote on a show of hands. Every shareholder present (in
	person or by proxy, attorney or representative) and entitled to vote has one vote per fully paid
	ordinary share on a poll. This is subject to any other rights or restrictions which may be attached
	to any shares. Our ADS holders may instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares underlying
	their ADSs, but only if we ask the depositary to ask for their instructions. If we do not ask the
	depositary to ask for the instructions, our ADS holders are not entitled to receive our notices of
	general meeting or instruct the depositary how to vote. Our ADS holders will not be entitled to
	attend and vote at a general meeting unless they withdraw the ordinary shares. However, our ADS
	holders may not know about the meeting enough in advance to withdraw the shares. If we ask for our
	ADS holders instructions, the depositary will notify our ADS holders of the upcoming vote and
	arrange to deliver our voting materials and form of notice to them.


	     The depositary will try, as far as practical, subject to Australian law and the provisions of
	the depositary agreement, to vote the shares as our ADS holders instruct. The depositary will not
	vote or attempt to exercise the right to vote other than in accordance with the instructions of the
	ADS holders. We cannot assure our ADS holders that they will receive the voting materials in time
	to ensure that they can instruct the depositary to vote their shares. In addition, there may be
	other circumstances in which our ADS holders may not be able to exercise voting rights.







	Item 4. Information on Metal Storm




	A. History and Development of Metal Storm



	     Our legal and commercial name is Metal Storm Limited, which was incorporated under the laws of
	Australia on April 13, 1994. Our principal office is located at Building 4, 848 Boundary Road,
	Richlands, Queensland 4077, Australia. Our telephone number is 011-61-7-3123-4700. Our website
	address is www.metalstorm.com. Information on our website and websites linked to it do not
	constitute part of this annual report. In 2001, our subsidiary Metal Storm Inc. opened an office in
	Arlington, Virginia, which is close to the Pentagon. Our agent for service of process in the United
	States is Mr. Peter D. Faulkner, 4350 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 810, Arlington, VA 22203.


	     In 1994, we acquired patents and intellectual property from Mr. J.M. ODwyer. In consideration
	for these patents, we issued to him 1,125,000 ordinary shares. Between May 1994 and March 1999, a
	total of 2,625,000 ordinary shares were issued to a variety of investors raising a total of
	A$1,993,875.


	     In anticipation of our initial public offering in Australia, we effected a 21.4 to 1 stock
	split in March 1999 that increased our issued capital from 3,750,002 to 80,250,042 ordinary shares.
	In June 1999, we raised A$12 million in an initial public offering in Australia by offering and
	selling 4,000,000 ordinary shares at an issue price of A$3.00 per share. Our ordinary shares were
	listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in July 1999 under the symbol MST. In May 2000, we
	effected a 5 to 1 stock split, thereby increasing our issued capital from 84,250,042 to 421,250,210
	ordinary shares.


	     In 2000, we commenced a Level 1 American Depositary Receipts (ADR) program with The Bank of
	New York as depositary and our ADRs traded on the over-the-counter market. In December 2001, we
	commenced a Level 2 ADR program and our ADRs commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under
	the ticker symbol MTSX. From 2001 through 2004, we raised A$27.3 million through a share purchase
	plan that was available only to Australian residents and various private placements of ordinary
	shares in Australia.


	     In December 2003, we acquired Seattle-based ProCam Machine LLC (ProCam) in exchange for the
	issuance of 5,524,926 ordinary shares of Metal Storm Limited and US$189,739 cash. As part of this
	acquisition, Metal Storm assumed US$2.2 million in debt. ProCam was a manufacturer of
	precision-machined parts for the defense, electronics, aircraft and space propulsion industries. In
	June 2005, Metal Storm sold the ProCam business. The sale enabled Metal Storm to preserve cash
	resources and better focus on commercializing its 40mm weapons systems.


	     In May 2006, we raised A$2.7 million through a share purchase plan available only to
	shareholders resident in Australia and New Zealand. In September 2006, we raised A$25.6 million
	under a fully underwritten renounceable rights offer (Rights Offer) of convertible notes
	available only to shareholders resident in Australia and New Zealand. The Rights Offer was made
	concurrently with an offer of one new share option for every convertible note allotted.


	     In May 2008, we listed our convertible notes on the Port Moresby Stock Exchange Limited under
	the symbol MSTG.

	Table of Contents





	     In July 2008, we delisted our ADSs from the NASDAQ Capital Market and moved trading of our
	ADSs back to the OTC market under the symbol MTSXY. We have maintained our registration with the
	Securities and Exchange Commission.


	     In July 2009, we raised A$2.6 million through a share purchase plan available only to
	shareholders resident in Australia and New Zealand. The settlement of the SPP, however, is
	conditioned on an affirmative vote by the holders of our convertible notes and holders of our
	ordinary shares to extend the maturity date and there can be no assurance that the maturity date of
	the convertible notes will be extended.



	B. Business Overview



	     Metal Storm is a defense technology company with offices in Australia and the United States.
	We specialize in the research, design, development and integration of projectile launching systems
	utilizing our electronically initiated / stacked projectile technology for use in the defense,
	homeland security, law enforcement and industrial markets.



	Strategy



	     We are focused on developing and qualifying two 40mm calibre weapons systems plus one 18mm
	calibre weapons system that together could offer substantial, differentiated benefits to military
	and law enforcement users.


	     In addition, we pursue contracts with military customers and major defense contractors where
	our unique stacked projectile launching technology and component weapon systems can be applied for
	specific end-user requirements and where these contracts may open up opportunities for Metal Storm
	weapon sales.


	     Over the past year, we have seen a significant increase in U.S. military interest in
	less-lethal weapons technology. Giving the soldier the option to respond to a threat with lethal
	or less-lethal force when placed in complex urban conflict or peacekeeping missions may reduce
	civilian casualties. Our multi-barrel stacked round weapons can provide instantly selectable
	lethal or less-lethal munitions, giving a clear advantage to Metal Storm in this emerging market.


	     We have entered into a number of strategic partnerships with major companies, including
	Singapore Technologies Kinetics (STK), iRobot, Electro Optic Systems, and Defence Technologies
	Inc., where partners provide capabilities such as manufacturing, complementary technology, or
	access to markets in areas where Metal Storm is not currently active.


	     In particular, we signed a Joint Collaboration Agreement with STK with the specific objective
	being to collaborate in the design, development, testing, qualification, manufacture of prototypes
	and demonstration weapons and munitions as well as the commercial production and marketing of
	munitions and selected Metal Storm ballistic weapons. This agreement provides us with a
	well-qualified partner to bring our weapons and munitions though the remaining stages to product
	sale and delivery.


	     To help us achieve these goals, we have populated Metal Storm with highly qualified
	professional staff with specific skills and experience in required areas, built a strong team of
	engineers and scientists to focus on the accelerated development of potential products and
	increased our business development activities in key U.S. defense and homeland security markets and
	selected international markets.


	     


	Engineering




	     We have maintained and improved our engineering organization during 2008. A primary goal was
	to transition the team from concept research and development team, to adopt the disciplines of
	product design, testing and qualification suitable for military standard production weapons
	development. This included the enhancement of existing engineering processes, configuration and
	change control as well as the adoption of more rigorous quality control on manufactured items to
	ensure the validity of test results against design specification.


	     The Metal Storm engineering team has benefited from enhanced access to STK ballistics
	engineers, safety and certification specialists, manufacturing facilities and firing ranges through
	the STK Joint Collaboration Agreement. Extensive design, testing and firing was performed
	throughout 2008 both in Australia and Singapore with the aim of bringing the 40mm high explosive
	ammunition and 3GL to a qualified standard appropriate for military trials, while improving the
	cost of manufacture. In addition we made major advances in systems safety analysis and procedures,
	to ensure that material potential risk on any aspect of the weapon system was discovered,
	documented and actions taken to bring the risk to an acceptable level prior to qualification tests
	being carried out.


	     In parallel with this, our U.S. based engineering team continued to advance the MAUL,
	FireStorm and less-lethal munitions development in harmony with its U.S. military contract
	obligations. Particular highlights were the successful provision
	of FireStorm and



	12









	Table of Contents





	a range of less-lethal munitions to the U.S. Marines for testing and progress on an enhanced MAUL design
	for a development contract with the Office of Naval Research. A number of additional test
	firings were carried out in 2008, including a public demonstration of the MAUL proof gun at the
	NDIA show in Dallas, Texas, and a 16shot volley of live chemical payload rounds from FireStorm
	at a target range of 150 metres.


	     


	Business Development




	     Our business development strategy continues to be focused on winning commercial contracts for
	the supply and integration of weapons systems that employ Metal Storm technology. The majority of
	business development effort is in the United States, where there is a substantial defense research
	and development industry; however, opportunities are being sought in the Middle East, Asia and
	Europe.


	     Where possible, we seek contracts where we can leverage our technology developments in the
	40mm and 18mm arena. We have expanded our market scope to include law enforcement and homeland
	security agencies, in particular for the MAUL and the less-lethal applications of FireStorm. We
	expect to see demand for 18mm systems for lightweight accessory weapons for ground troops and law
	enforcement personnel and as armament for small robotic air and land vehicles.


	     In 2008, we engaged EH Group, a business development and marketing consultancy specialising in
	U.S. defense markets. EH Group has actively pursued potential weapons programs and has enhanced
	our presence with the U.S. military and other defense contractors.


	     During 2008, we broadened our U.S. and international exposure through conferences and trade
	shows, including the Singapore AirShow, EuroSatory, NDIA, (U.S.) National Guard Show, (U.S.) Modern
	Day Marine Show, the Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA) Exposition. With the first weapons
	nearing qualification, shaping the global market is an important step in the sales process.


	     As a key element of our business development strategy, we conduct live fire trials and
	demonstrations to showcase the technical and operational capabilities of our technology and
	prototype products. These trials also serve an engineering purpose, providing essential
	performance data for design enhancement. Typically, we aim to conduct these demonstrations for a
	select audience of members of the military and defense industry. Through the demonstrations and
	with feedback from the audience members, we are made aware of additional requirements dictated by
	the projected end-user environment. We are also able to better assess logistical requirements for
	increased reliability and supportability and means to minimize production costs.


	     


	Technology




	     Metal Storms core technology is an electronically initiated, stacked projectile launching
	system that removes the mechanisms and shortens the time normally required to fire projectiles by
	conventional means. The core technology has been demonstrated in launching systems ranging from 9mm
	to 60mm and from low velocity to high velocity and can theoretically be applied to much wider range
	of calibres. However, we have focused our design and development efforts on a low velocity 40mm
	launching system and incorporated upgraded versions of the system into our 3GL, FireStorm and
	Redback weapon systems.


	     The upgraded version of the low velocity 40mm grenade launching system has the potential to be
	used in multi-barrel arrays retro-fitted alongside conventional 40mm weapons. This provides a
	hybrid weapon system with multiple munition types utilizing the existing mount, targeting and
	aiming system of the conventional weapon. It also offers the user a considerable increase in the
	firepower and versatility of their existing weapon stations at comparatively low cost.


	     In relation to the stacked projectile nature of the launching system, the only parts that move
	in Metal Storms technology are the projectiles contained within the barrels. Multiple projectiles
	are stacked one behind the other in the barrel and the technology allows each projectile to be
	fired sequentially from the barrel by electronic initiation of the propellant load. Each
	projectile has its own propellant load, so that the leading projectile can be reliably fired
	without causing unplanned blow-by ignition of the following projectiles and without collapse of the
	projectile column in the barrel. Metal Storms fully loaded barrel tubes are essentially
	serviceable weapons, without the need for a traditional ammunition feed or ejection system, breech
	opening or any other moving parts. These barrels can be effectively grouped in multiple
	configurations to meet a diversity of applications.


	     Metal Storms technology is ideally suited to the new generation of network centric weapons
	that are designed to fully integrate with todays digitally controlled battlefield. Importantly,
	Metal Stormenabled systems are capable of local or remote operation through computerized fire
	control systems.

	Joint Collaboration Agreement with Singapore Technologies Kinetics




	     In February 2008, Metal Storm entered into a Joint Collaboration Agreement with STK to take
	our 3GL and 40mm ammunition to the manufacturing stage. Under the terms of the agreement, Metal
	Storm and STK have agreed to collaborate in the design, development, testing, qualification,
	manufacture of prototypes and demonstration weapons and munitions as well as the commercial
	production and marketing of munitions and selected Metal Storm ballistic weapons that only use
	those munitions. STK is contributing funds toward completing the demonstration and trial 3GL
	weapons and munitions. The agreement is expected to result in munitions that are compatible with
	all of Metal Storms 40mm weapons and would allow Metal Storm to expand its operationally-ready
	munitions to additional types. The agreement terminates in December 2020.


	     In addition to development and manufacture, STK may market, distribute and support other Metal
	Storm weapons and munitions.


	     In September 2005, Metal Storm entered into an exclusive Teaming Agreement with STK for the
	development, testing, manufacture and marketing of munitions to be used in conjunction with Metal
	Storm projects. The agreement terminates in December 2012 unless terminated earlier by joint
	agreement of the parties or upon a default by one party. The agreement provides that intellectual
	property that is developed solely by one party under the agreement will be owned solely by that
	party. Intellectual property that is developed through the collaboration of both parties will be
	owned solely or jointly by Metal Storm, except for technology relating to the internal workings of
	the warheads, which will be owned by STK. Each party is responsible for its own development costs
	under the agreement. This Teaming Agreement is now incorporated under the Joint Collaboration
	Agreement.


	     


	Internal Product Development




	     We are actively developing and/or is in the process of certifying the following products:





	 



	



	 


	3GL  semi-automatic three shot 40mm modular underbarrel grenade launcher;




	 




	 



	



	 


	FireStorm  four barrel 16 shot 40mm remotely operated weapon system;




	 




	 



	



	 


	MAUL  semi automatic 18mm (12 gauge) multi-shot accessory under-barrel launcher;
	and




	 




	 



	



	 


	A range of 40mm and 18mm lethal and less-lethal ammunition.





	     In conjunction with Electro Optic Systems Limited (EOS), we have also developed Redback, a
	fast four barrel 16-shot 40mm remotely operated weapons system. The Redback system is
	particularly suited to convoy protection and is designed to be capable of defending against
	rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) attacks. During 2008, Metal Storm performed only limited
	development on Redback, as most of Metal Storms initial development goals had been reached, and
	EOS target acquisition and tracking components were being developed by EOS. However, technology
	developed for Redback has also been incorporated into FireStorm. It is expected that further
	work on Redback will be done once a specific customer is identified and contracted, whereupon the
	product would be tailored to suit particular customer needs.


	     

	3GL



	     The 3GL was developed to overcome many of the deficiencies of existing 40mm shoulder fired
	grenade launchers. Most current 40mm underslung grenade launchers are single shot. Multi-shot
	grenade launchers are heavy, bulky and in practice do not permit the soldier to also carry an
	assault rifle.


	     Single shot 40mm grenade launchers have several significant and obvious operational drawbacks.
	In a firefight, the 40mm grenade is a powerful weapon. It has a psychological as well as physical
	impact on the enemy. However, often one shot is not enough and, after the first round is fired,
	the enemy can re-position while the soldier is reloading. Being able to keep eye-on-target and
	deliver a second and third round immediately onto a mobile enemy substantially increases the
	effectiveness of the weapon, and potentially alters the outcome of the firefight.



	14









	Table of Contents





	     The 3GL is a semi-automatic three shot underslung grenade launcher that can be fitted to a
	soldiers assault weapon. It carries less than one pound additional weight penalty over a single
	shot M203 grenade launcher, while providing three times the firepower before reloading. This
	cannot be achieved using conventional weapons technology, as the mechanical auto-reload system
	would add many additional pounds and increase the size to the point where an underslung weapon
	would be impractical for the soldier on the battlefield.


	     Development of the 3GL has been underway for over two years. Key achievements during 2008
	included:





	 



	



	 


	successfully firing the weapon with stacked rounds while attached to an M16 assault
	rifle;




	 




	 



	



	 


	successfully firing stacks of high explosive rounds;




	 




	 



	



	 


	successful firing of hundreds of rounds of inert, safe-arm and explosive test
	ammunition; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	successful systems safety and certification review of the design process by Nova
	Defence, an independent defense company.





	     In February 2009, after extensive development and testing as a part of the Joint Collaboration
	Agreement with STK, the 3GL achieved certification for safe man-firing using 40mm ammunition with
	non-explosive warheads. Qualification for man-firing using 40mm high explosive ammunition will
	follow once the ammunition itself completes qualification. A more ruggedised version of the 3GL is
	currently undergoing the final stages of development as part of a spiral development process Once
	completed, the enhanced 3GL will undertake the environmental and operational testing required to
	qualify it for military trials.


	     

	Redback



	     The Redback weapons system is a multi-barreled pod that is designed to detect a target, slew
	into position, and be fired at extremely high speeds. The system includes detection, acquisition
	and tracking electronics that are ultimately aimed at protecting vehicles from incoming
	rocket-propelled grenade attacks. Unlike other anti-RPG systems, Redback could be used as a
	conventional weapon for engaging conventional targets.


	     Redback is being developed in a consortium with EOS, which will supply the gimbal, mount and
	acquisition and tracking electronics, and ST Kinetics, which will provide the ammunition. The
	weapon components are being funded and developed by Metal Storm.


	     

	FireStorm



	     FireStorm is a lightweight multi-barrel 40mm remotely operated weapons system, which Metal
	Storm is currently developing to fulfil multiple roles in urban conflict, peacekeeping, convoy and
	asset protection and civil crowd control environments. By taking full advantage of Metal Storm
	developments in both lethal and less-lethal munitions, FireStorm could provide a greater
	flexibility for military forces, law enforcement and security personnel.


	     The separation of a weapon from its crew is an increasing characteristic of military
	operations. Whether mounted on the top of a vehicle, on the corner of a building or boundary
	fence, or on a robotic platform, it is more difficult and dangerous for people to physically attend
	to a remote weapon during an engagement. A jammed weapon can be a lethal liability.


	     FireStorm can be deployed on ground robots, placed on vantage points for fixed asset and
	perimeter protection, mounted on lightweight vehicles and used in both lethal and less-lethal
	operations. FireStorm guns have no moving parts in the firing sequence, eliminating the potential
	for mechanical reload jamming. The barrels can be hermetically sealed, yet still be available for
	immediate remote firing as needed. These, together with the ability to select the ammunition type
	remotely at the time of firing, reduce the likelihood of exposing personnel to potentially lethal
	enemy fire, giving a potential competitive advantage to FireStorm in this market.


	     Another distinguishing characteristic of FireStorm is its instantaneous firepower.
	FireStorm can deliver up to 16 high explosive grenades instantaneously onto the same target,
	multiplying the target damage potential of the weapon.


	     While FireStorm is currently configured as a four barrel 16 shot system, its major components
	are modular and could be reconfigured for other purposes with, for example, more barrels, greater
	ammunition loads and even a combination of 40mm and 18mm calibres within the one weapon system.


	     Specific FireStorm development has been in progress for 18 months, building on the foundation
	of earlier four barrel weapons systems development including Redback. Key achievements during
	2008 included:





	 



	



	 


	addition of LASER ranging;




	 




	 



	



	 


	addition of day visible sights;




	 




	 



	



	 


	enhanced fire control systems;

	



	 


	addition of LASER Dazzler non-lethal response capability; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	testing performed by U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.





	     In September 2008 Metal Storm Inc. provided FireStorm to the U.S. Marines for test firing by
	their personnel under a contract with the Marine Corps Systems Command. Less-lethal chemical
	payload rounds and frangible nose blunt impact chemical dispersion rounds were fired during the
	test. During 2009, Metal Storm Inc. expects to bid for further less-lethal programs within the
	U.S. military using the FireStorm weapons system.


	     

	MAUL

	


	     The MAUL is an extremely lightweight 12 gauge accessory shotgun designed to fulfil a range of
	combat and law enforcement roles including door breaching, lethal and non-lethal response, and
	specialty payload delivery. Minimal size and weight are hallmarks of the MAUL.
	MAUL

	TM

	is currently the lightest, smallest automatic fire under-barrel shotgun in the
	world.


	     12 gauge (18mm) shotguns are in widespread use throughout the military, law enforcement and
	other government agencies. Shotguns offer greater versatility than conventional assault weapons,
	and are used to meet a range of special requirements including door breaching, short range
	operations, and engagements with less-lethal ammunition. This versatility is set to extend as new
	ammunition types become available.


	     A major issue with 12 gauge deployment is that it usually requires personnel to carry a
	separate additional weapon or sacrifice their primary weapon. Attempts to create shotgun
	attachments for assault rifles have been constrained by the weight and bulk of the required
	magazine and mechanical reload system. Metal Storm has identified this as a unique opportunity for
	its technology hence the development of the MAUL.


	     The MAUL incorporates unique Metal Storm stacked round technology, eliminating the need for
	mechanical parts to reload the weapon between each shot. Its profile is slim, consisting primarily
	of a cartridge/barrel tube plus a trigger and small battery housing. It eliminates the bulky bolt
	action receiver and extended magazine of legacy systems, and requires no manual action between
	shots.


	     The MAUL was first conceived under a contract with the U.S. Marines Warfighting Laboratory.
	A proof gun and 600 munitions were delivered to the U.S. Marines in May 2008. The gun was
	successfully demonstrated at a public firing at the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA)
	show in Dallas, Texas in the same month. In June 2008, the Office of Naval Research awarded a
	US$936,695 contract to Metal Storm Inc. to continue the development of the MAUL and demonstrate a
	fully operational unit on an M4 rifle by May 2009. The demonstration occurred as scheduled in May
	2009 and the project is expected to meet the delivery date.


	     

	Systems for Unmanned Vehicles



	     Metal Storm weapon systems are well suited to robotic vehicle applications as they are
	lightweight with all projectiles pre-stacked in the barrel. Additionally, with the lack of
	mechanical parts associated with conventional reload systems, the weapons are expected to be
	reliable and suitable for tele-robotic applications.


	     Metal Storm has already demonstrated such systems, including a series of live fire
	demonstrations that were held at the U.S. Armys range facility at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey
	in March 2005. The demonstrations consisted of multiple live firings of a purpose-built version of
	the Metal Storm 40mm weapon system, mounted on a TALON unmanned ground vehicle produced by Foster
	Miller.


	     We have also worked with Dragonfly Pictures Inc., a U.S. designer/manufacturer of unmanned
	helicopters, to weaponize a version of its DP-4X Vertical Take Off and Landing Unmanned Aerial
	Vehicle. Demonstrations of this system were held in September 2006.


	     In October 2007, Metal Storm entered into a memorandum of understanding with iRobot, a
	worldwide leader in the supply of military robots. The FireStorm weapon has been integrated with
	the iRobot Warrior robot. This was successfully demonstrated to both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy
	proving its ability to deliver 40mm less-lethal and lethal rounds from a remote robotic platform.


	     Metal Storm continues to pursue opportunities for the application of its technology to
	unmanned robotic platforms.


	     

	Ammunition

	Table of Contents





	     A number of ammunition natures for Metal Storm 40mm and 18mm systems have been under
	development.


	          

	40mm lethal ammunition



	     The low velocity 40mm lethal round program (STORM40) progressed well throughout 2008 and
	work on the certification of test practice rounds for man-firing is now complete. Limited
	qualification testing for high explosive rounds is planned to commence in 2009. The STORM40
	program is designed for full integration of the ammunition with the 3GL and FireStorm weapon
	systems, and on completion will allow us to demonstrate the enhanced capability of 3 rounds of
	high explosive warheads being man fired from a 3GL.


	          

	40mm less-lethal ammunition



	     Substantial work has been carried out in 2008 on a number of less-lethal ammunition types.
	The challenge with less-lethal projectiles is to keep weight down to maintain a less than lethal
	outcome, while also incorporating the additional Metal Storm ignition and propellant systems
	within the projectile itself. Three main types of less-lethal 40mm ammunition have been
	developed and are under test. Blunt impact sponge rounds were successfully test fired at the
	beginning of 2008. Frangible nose blunt impact chemical dispersion rounds have also been adapted
	for Metal Storm launchers. These rounds combine single target blunt impact with an area
	dispersion of an irritant or marker dye. Finally a chemical payload round was adapted for
	delivering tear gas or other payloads in stacked munition Metal Storm launchers. The latter two
	round types were delivered as ammunition with FireStorm for the Marine Corps Systems Command
	Market Research Demonstration, and all have been successfully demonstrated at other test firings
	through the second half of 2008.


	          

	18mm (12 gauge) ammunition



	     Ammunition development for the MAUL is essential for the commercial success of the weapon.
	Metal Storm developed and tested munitions technology to launch stacked FRAG 12 door breaching
	grenades from the MAUL in the first half of 2008. Additional 18mm MAUL munitions developed
	during 2008 include solid projectile, and blunt impact less lethal rounds. Several other
	projectile natures are currently being evaluated for adaption to the MAUL.


	     

	Fireworks



	     Metal Storm holds a number of patents relating to the formation of aerial images. The
	fireworks research is intended to add value to this intellectual property. Initial development has
	demonstrated the ability to launch, spin-stabilize and light the fuse of fireworks projectiles in a
	stacked configuration. There are currently no specific fireworks products under development.


	     

	Handgun



	     After thorough analyses of the state of our handgun technology, the challenges of obtaining
	certification, likely production and marketing costs, the state of competition and market
	sensitivities, and the time and funds required to successfully generate a product, it is clear that
	the handgun in either its basic or smartgun form, should not be our primary focus for internal
	investment at this time.


	     


	External Development Programs




	     In addition to our internal product development programs, we seek external funding from
	military and government agencies to develop products in collaboration with other parties.


	     

	U.S. Navy SBIR Contract  Metal Storm Active Protection System



	     This contract was for the development of a remotely controlled Active Protection System for
	mounting on various types of unmanned ground vehicles. It was funded through a Phase II Small
	Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract sponsored by the U.S. Navys Space and Naval Warfare
	Systems Command and the Office of Naval Research. Metal Storm provided an unattended remotely
	operated weapon system designed to operate in a networked environment for the protection of very
	high value assets. The contract, which commenced in January 2006, was completed in March 2008.


	     

	U.S. Army SBIR Contract  Metal Storm Crowd Control System



	     This contract was for the development and testing of a Crowd Control System using Metal Storm
	40mm weapons technology and less-lethal munitions. It was funded through a U.S. Army Phase II SBIR
	contract sponsored by the U.S. Army ARDEC. Metal Storm is developing and fabricating specific
	less-lethal rounds capable of being fired from Metal Storm weapon systems in a
	variety of configurations as a means



	17









	Table of Contents





	to control potentially hostile crowds from infringing
	upon or interrupting ongoing operations. This contract, which commenced in December 2005, was
	completed in January 2008.


	     

	U.S. Marine Corps  18mm Stacked Round Firing System



	     This contract was for the design, fabrication and test of 18mm stacked round firing systems.
	Under the terms of the contract, Metal Storm explored the feasibility of employing 18mm fin
	stabilized high explosive projectiles from an accessory under-barrel weapon for the M-16A4 service
	rifle. The firing technology led to a test bed capability potentially leading to U.S. Marine Corps
	experimentation with larger diameter finned projectiles than are possible with shot gun-launched
	munitions. The contract was announced in July 2006 and was completed in March 2008.


	     

	Commercial Contract  Design Support Services



	     Under this contract, Metal Storm is providing design support and participating in a series of
	tests for a major defense contractor. The contract was awarded in late December 2007 and is
	scheduled to be completed in August 2009.


	     

	U.S. Navy  Multi-Shot Accessory Underbarrel Launcher



	     This contract is for the further development of the MAUL. Under the contract, Metal Storm
	will continue development of a 12-gauge, Multi-shot Accessory Underbarrel Grenade Launcher (MAUL).
	The project extends the work performed previously under a contract with the U.S. Marine Corps. The
	contract commenced in June 2008 and is expected to be completed in September 2009.


	     

	U.S. Marine Corps  Mission Payload Module Demonstration



	     Under the terms of the contract, Metal Storm was required to prepare and deliver one
	demonstration model for a government-controlled market research demonstration to evaluate
	capabilities for the Mission Payload ModuleNon-Lethal Weapons System. The contract was awarded
	in June 2008 and completed in November 2008.



	Competition



	     Until we commercialize a product using our technology, we continue to compete for technology
	research and development funding available through various areas that are administered by the U.S.
	Department of Defense and other government agencies, including, for example, under the SBIR
	Program.


	     The commercial success of products that we develop will depend in part on competing products.
	Large, well-established defense companies and other entities with collaborative arrangements with
	the government are also engaged in research and development and may have considerably greater
	resources than us to develop applications for defense technology. We cannot be certain that our
	competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than
	any which we are developing, or which would render our technology and products obsolete or
	non-competitive.



	Regulation



	     Our research and development activities are, and the production and marketing of the products
	that we are developing are likely to be, subject to regulation by governmental authorities in
	Australia, the United States and other countries where we may market our technology. Prior to
	marketing, our technology and any product may be required to undergo rigorous testing as well as
	extensive regulatory approval processes.


	     


	Australia




	     We have authority under the Weapons Act 1990 (Queensland) to engage in scientific or
	experimental work. In compliance with the Australian Weapons Act and Australian Controls on the
	Export of Defense and Strategic Goods, we have a weapons movement procedure policy. We do not
	currently envisage manufacturing any products in Australia, however, in the event that we do, we
	would be required to obtain a manufacturers license to enable us to manufacture and export our
	products. In addition, we would be regulated by the Australian Department of Defense Export
	Controls under which we would be required to obtain an export distribution license. Licenses and
	permits may be difficult to obtain and retain depending on government policies, customs, changes in
	political leadership, and other factors. These processes and obtaining licensing and permits may
	take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources.


	     To the extent our activities under Australian government contracts may require access to or
	result in the development of information classified by the Australian government, such activities
	may become subject to Australian government regulations.



	18









	Table of Contents





	     Products to be manufactured using our technology may also be subject to government regulation.
	These may include regulations governing use, specification, manufacture, handling, disposal,
	packaging, labeling, transport and import and export in Australia and in each of the countries into
	which such products are intended to be exported.


	     


	United States




	     Sales to U.S. military and to federal law enforcement agencies will be regulated by the U.S.
	Federal Acquisition Regulations and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations. Sales to local and
	state law enforcement agencies will be subject to the procurement regulations of the jurisdictions
	involved, as well as applicable federal regulations. We plan to be in compliance with all
	regulatory and licensing requirements.


	     To the extent our activities under U.S. government contracts may require access to or result
	in the development of information classified by the U.S. government, such activities may become
	subject to U.S. government regulations, including the Defense Industrial Security Regulations and
	the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, which impose restrictions on a foreign
	companys ability to control or to have access to information in the possession of a cleared U.S.
	company performing classified contracts. The U.S. and Australian governments have entered into a
	Statement of Principles for Enhanced Cooperation in Matters of Defense Equipment and Industry that
	is intended to facilitate sharing classified information between the governments and cleared
	companies.



	Intellectual Property



	     We principally rely upon patents, trade secret, copyright and contract law to protect the
	intellectual property in our proprietary technology. See Item 3D Key Information  Risk Factors
	for a discussion of risks associated with protecting our intellectual property.


	     We aggressively pursue patent applications for new inventions. Since our inception, we have

	Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects



	     You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 3A Key
	Information  Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements, the notes to the
	consolidated financial statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this
	annual report. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
	International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In addition to historical information, the
	following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that
	reflect our plans, estimates, intentions, expectations and beliefs. Our actual results could differ
	materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 3D Key Information 
	Risk Factors and other forward-looking statements in this annual report for a discussion of some,
	but not all factors that could cause or contribute to such differences.



	A. Operating Results




	Overview



	     We are a defense technology company that is involved in the research, development and
	commercialization of projectile launching systems that utilize electronically fired, stacked
	projectile technology. In 2008, we worked on several contracts with the U.S. military and various
	private companies.


	     In order to meet Metal Storms objectives to develop, manufacture and market commercial
	products effectively, we may require further funding until such time that product sales are of
	sufficient volume to generate positive cash flows from operations. This has taken longer and has
	cost more than originally anticipated. Based on the expected levels of operating expenditures, in
	order to continue its operations past mid-2009, Metal Storm will require additional sources of
	capital. While Metal Storm has previously been successful in raising additional capital, there can
	be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to continue our operations. If we
	are unsuccessful in our efforts to obtain sufficient financing to continue to fund our current
	operations, we will be required to significantly reduce or cease operations altogether.


	     We intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development as we
	transition our technology from proof of concept to product implementation. Most of our funding for
	our external development programs has come from capital raisings in Australia. We have also
	received revenue from grants and contracts under various government programs. We fund our internal
	product development through our accumulated funds.

	Table of Contents





	     We have incurred net losses since our inception. We recognized a net loss of A$15.3 million,
	A$10.0 million and A$10.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008,
	respectively. Our accumulated losses from inception in 1994 to December 31, 2008 are A$88.4
	million. We expect to incur increasing losses in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in
	the research and development of our patented electronically initiated stacked projectile
	technology prior to entering into commercialization phase. We expect that losses will fluctuate
	from period to period and that such fluctuations may be substantial as a result of, among other
	things, the results of our research and development programs, the number of future prototypes we
	produce and test and potential design changes required as a result of testing. We are approaching
	the latter stage of product development and do not expect any significant revenue from product
	sales until at least the second half of 2010. While there has been significant interest in our
	proof-of-concept demonstrations, we cannot give assurance that we will manufacture or sell our
	products successfully or ever achieve or sustain profitability.


	     Refer to Item 3-D Risk Factors for further information on Metal Storms capital requirements
	and substantial doubt over our ability to continue as a going concern.



	Where We Derive Our Revenue



	     In 2008 and 2007, our principal sources of revenue were construction contracts and interest
	income.



	Critical Accounting Policies



	     Our discussion and analysis of our operating and financial review and prospects are based upon
	our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued
	by the IASB. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make
	estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue, assets, liabilities and
	expenses. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical
	experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
	circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
	conditions.


	     We believe the following are our critical accounting policies that affect our more significant
	judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Refer to footnote 4
	on page F-22 of this annual report for further information.


	     


	Revenue Recognition




	     Revenue is recognized and measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
	receivable to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to Metal Storm
	and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be
	met before revenue is recognized:


	     

	Sale of goods



	     Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have
	passed to the buyer and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be
	measured reliably. Risks and rewards of ownership are considered passed to the buyer at the time of
	delivery of the goods to and acceptance by the customer, and collectability of the selling price is
	reasonably assured.


	     

	Rendering of services



	     Revenue is recognized when key milestones or deliverables specified within each agreement are
	achieved and accepted by all parties to the agreement, no performance obligation with respect to
	the milestone or deliverables remains, the arrangement fee is fixed, and collectibility is
	reasonably assured. For most of our contract service revenue arrangements, revenue is recognized
	upon delivery of a report summarizing the findings of specified research activities requested by
	our customers. For those contracts requiring acceptance of the delivery of our report by our
	customers, we recognize revenue upon receipt of written acceptance or payment in lieu of written
	acceptance.


	     

	Construction contracts



	     Construction revenue and expenses are recognized in accordance with the percentage of
	completion method unless the outcome of the contract cannot be reliably estimated. Where it is
	probable that a loss will arise from a construction contract, the excess of total expected contract
	costs over total expected contract revenue is recognized as an expense immediately.

	     For fixed price contracts, the stage of completion is measured by reference to labor hours
	incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total labor hours for each contract. Revenue from
	cost-plus contracts is recognized by reference to the recoverable costs incurred during the
	reporting period plus the percentage of fees earned.


	     The percentage of fees earned is measured by the proportion that costs incurred to date bear
	to the estimated total costs of the contract. Where the outcome of a contract cannot be reliably
	estimated, contract costs are recognized as an expense as incurred, and where it is probable that
	the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred.


	     


	Share-based payment transactions




	     We provide benefits to employees (including directors) of Metal Storm in the form of
	share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or
	rights over shares (equity-settled transactions). We currently provide these benefits through (i)
	shares and options issued to executives and employees as part of a remuneration package issued in
	accordance with the power contained in our constitution and (ii) the Employee Share Option Plan
	(ESOP).


	     The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the
	fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined using a
	Black-Scholes model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance
	conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Metal Storm Limited (market
	conditions). The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognized, together with a corresponding
	increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on
	the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting date).


	     The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until
	vesting date reflects (i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the number of
	awards that, in the opinion of the Directors of Metal Storm, will ultimately vest. This opinion is
	formed based on the best available information at balance date. No adjustment is made for the
	likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included
	in the determination of fair value at grant date.



	Comparison of Annual Results of Operations



	     


	2008 compared with 2007




	     

	Revenue.

	Revenue decreased by A$1,004,050 from A$3,205,381 in 2007 to A$2,201,331 in 2008 due
	to reduced fees earned from construction contracts carried out by our U.S. office and lower
	interest income of $313,349 as a result of lower average cash balances and lower interest rates.


	     Contract revenue was generated from seven contracts during 2008 most of which were awarded
	prior to 2008 but completed during the year.


	     

	Expenses.

	Total expenses decreased A$346,198 (3%) from A$13,203,532 in 2007 to A$12,857,334 in
	2008. Significant movements in expenses were:





	 



	



	 


	In 2008 we had a fair value movement gain of A$3,620,682 on the embedded derivative that
	reflects the movement in the fair value of the conversion option embedded in the convertible
	notes issued in 2006. In 2007, we had a fair value gain of A$2,421,338.




	 




	 



	



	 


	Foreign exchange differences changed from a loss of (A$68,197) in 2007 to a gain of
	A$444,598 in 2008. This is due to the movement in the U.S. dollars to Australian dollars
	exchange rate over the year compared to the corresponding movement in the prior year.




	 




	 



	



	 


	Finance expenses increased A$1,434,723 in 2008. Finance expenses primarily relate to the
	convertible notes that we issued in September 2006. This increase predominately relates to
	the accretion expense on the convertible notes issued in 2006 which were A$1,884,443 in 2007
	and A$3,238,228 in 2008. The accretion expense is calculated using the effective interest
	rate method which increases the relative dollar value of the expense over time.




	 




	 



	



	 


	Impairment expense increased A$548,400 in 2008. This expense is related to the impairment
	of floating rate notes where the fair value decreased from A$779,200 to A$10,000.





	     

	Net Loss.

	As a result of the foregoing, our net loss increased from approximately A$10.0
	million in 2007 to A$10.7 million in 2008. Due to our continuing losses, no income tax expense has
	been recognized.

	2007 compared with 2006




	     

	Revenue.

	Revenue increased by A$866,071 from A$2,339,310 in 2006 to A$3,205,381 in 2007 due to
	higher fees earned from construction contracts carried out by our U.S. office and higher interest
	income, which increased by A$595,768 to A$1,354,048 as a result of higher average cash balances.


	     Contract revenue was generated from six contracts during 2007. In addition, we completed a
	long-term contract with StarChase LLC valued at US$1.2 million. While some revenue relating to
	this contract had been recognized in 2006, no revenue was recognized in 2007 because the terms of
	the contract provided for the delay of payment until 2008.


	     

	Expenses.

	Total expenses decreased A$4.5 million (25%) from A$17.7 million in 2006 to A$13.2
	million in 2007. Significant movements in expenses were:





	 



	



	 


	Employee expenses decreased A$1,133,346 (20.7%) from A$5,481,934 in 2006 to A$4,348,588
	in 2007 due to a reduction in share based payments, termination payments and staff
	restructuring.




	 




	 



	



	 


	Research and development expenses increased A$681,035 (68.8%) due to the increased costs
	of test firings associated with the performance milestones of the Trust Deed.




	 




	 



	



	 


	Professional fees decreased A$410,227 (23.7%) primarily due to a non recurring expense in
	2006 of A$399,141 associated with a proposed capital raising that was terminated in 2006.




	 




	 



	



	 


	In 2007 we had a fair value movement gain of A$2,421,388 on the embedded derivative that
	reflects the movement in the fair value of the conversion option embedded in the convertible
	notes issued in 2006. In 2006, we had a fair value loss of A$4,469,042.




	 




	 



	



	 


	Finance expenses increased A$2,751,402 in 2007. Finance expenses primarily relate to the
	convertible notes that we issued in September 2006. Accordingly, interest and accretion
	expenses for 2006 reflect the period from September to December whereas finance expenses in
	2007 reflect the full year.





	     

	Net Loss.

	As a result of the foregoing, our net loss decreased from approximately A$15.3
	million in 2006 to A$10.0 million in 2008. Due to our continuing losses, no income tax expense has
	been recognized.



	Effects of Currency Fluctuations



	     Our functional currency and reporting currency is the Australian dollar.


	     In accordance with IFRS, costs not denominated in Australian dollars are re-measured in
	Australian dollars, when recorded, at the prevailing exchange rates for the purposes of our
	financial statements. Consequently, fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the Australian
	dollar and U.S. dollar currencies will affect our results of operations. An increase in the value
	of a particular currency relative to the Australian dollar will increase the Australian dollar
	reporting value for transactions in that particular currency, and a decrease in the value of that
	currency relative to the Australian dollar will decrease the Australian dollar reporting value for
	those transactions.


	     The effect of foreign currency translation is reflected in our financial statements in the
	statements of changes in shareholders equity and is reported as accumulated translation reserve.
	At December 31, 2008, the impact of the foreign currency translation was an accumulated reserve of
	(A$106,801) compared to accumulated reserve balance of (A$68,559) at December 31, 2007. The
	fluctuations are caused by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the
	U.S. dollar. We have not entered into any hedging arrangements to mitigate the effects of currency
	fluctuations.



	B. Liquidity and Capital Resources



	     


	Overview




	     We have incurred substantial losses since the formation of Metal Storm and anticipate
	incurring substantial additional losses over at least the next few years as we continue our
	research and development activities and conduct further trials of our technology. Our operations
	have been financed primarily from capital contributions by investors, interest income earned on
	cash and cash equivalents, and grants from government agencies.

	     Cash used in operating activities in each of the past two years consisted primarily of losses
	incurred in operations.


	     In 2007, net cash provided by investing activities consisted of interest income on deposits
	and the sale of financial investments. In 2008, net cash provided by investing activities
	consisted predominantly of interest income on deposits.


	     In 2007, financing activities consisted of the repayment of borrowings from short term loans.
	In 2008, financing activities consisted of borrowings in the form of short term loans.


	     Refer to Item 3-D Key Information  Risk Factors for further information on Metal Storms
	capital requirements and substantial doubt over our ability to continue as a going concern.


	     


	Borrowings




	     In 2008, Metal Storm borrowed an aggregate of A$4 million unsecured from two non-bank lenders
	for periods of up to five months. Interest was 12% and 15% per annum on the loans. The first loan
	was repaid during July 2008 and the second loan was repaid in January 2009.


	     In 2006, Metal Storm issued 203,703,704 convertible notes to existing shareholders in
	Australia and New Zealand at the rate of one convertible note for every 2.674 existing ordinary
	shares held to raise gross proceeds of A$27.5 million on September 1, 2006 under the Rights Offer.
	The Rights Offer was made concurrently with the offer of one new share option for every two
	convertible notes allotted, which resulted in 101,852,055 listed options being granted. In
	addition, 10 million options were granted to Harmony or its nominees in consideration for a short
	term working capital facility of A$5 million which was never drawn on by Metal Storm. A further 65
	million options were issued to Harmony as payment for Harmonys commitment to sub-underwrite the
	Rights Offer up to A$26.1 million.


	     Convertible notes bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum on the face value of A$0.135 per
	convertible note over the term. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The term of the
	convertible notes is three years from the date of issue unless converted into ordinary shares. The
	maturity date of the convertible notes is September 1, 2009, at which time Metal Storm must repay
	the face value of A$0.135 per convertible note to the Noteholders, unless Noteholders have elected
	to convert some or all of their convertible notes into ordinary shares at a conversion price which
	is the lesser of A$0.135 or 90% of the volume weighted average price of Metal Storms ordinary
	shares during the 30 business days immediately preceding the conversion date. Noteholders can elect
	to convert some or all of their convertible notes into ordinary shares at the beginning of each
	quarter, at the maturity date and at certain other times.


	     The convertible notes were issued under Trust Deed, the details of which are discussed in Item
	10-C Additional Information  Material Contracts of this Form 20-F. See Item 3D Key
	Information  Risk Factors  There is substantial doubt regarding Metal Storms ability to
	continue as a going concern and - We may be required to redeem convertible notes before maturity,
	which redemption could cause us to become insolvent.


	     Metal Storm has finance leases for workshop equipment and demountable buildings with a
	carrying amount of A$244,932. These leases expire within three years with no option to renew the
	leases or purchase the assets at the completion of the lease term. These finance leases are secured
	through a bank guarantee deposit. These leases have since been paid out in full.


	     In addition, our annual insurance premiums are paid by a third party financier to whom we make
	monthly repayments with interest. In 2008, the amount of this insurance premium was A$464,459 of
	which A$40,491 (including interest) is payable per month.

	Other Material Commitments




	     We had no material capital expenditures during the past two years and do not expect to incur
	any material capital expenditure in 2009. Refer to the table in Item 5-F Operating and Financial
	Review and Prospects  Tabular disclosure of contractual obligations for further details on
	commitments.


	     


	Future Cash Needs




	     We expect that operating expenses will continue to be the principal use of our cash resources.
	Available cash resources are expected to provide us with sufficient capital to fund our operations
	through Q3 2009. We will need to raise additional sources of funding before then and may seek it
	through equity or debt financings. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result
	in dilution to our shareholders. Additional debt would result in additional expenses and could
	result in covenants that would restrict our operations.


	     Our convertible notes mature in September 2009. We are in discussions with our largest holder
	of our convertible notes, Harmony Investment Fund Limited, to formulate a proposal to put to the
	holders of our convertible notes to extend the maturity date of the convertible notes. This
	proposal would require various consents and approvals, including existing noteholders and
	potentially shareholder approval. There can be no assurance that the maturity of the existing
	convertible notes will be extended. In addition, we are seeking to raise additional capital.


	     As of June 17, 2009 Metal Storm had approximately A$1.6 million in cash. Without a capital injection, Metal Storm will exhaust
	its resources at the end of July.


	     Refer to Item 3D Key Information  Risk Factors for further information on Metal Storms
	capital requirements and substantial doubt over our ability to continue as a going concern.



	C. Research and Development: Patents and Licenses



	     Our primary activity since incorporation in 1994 has been the research and development of our
	technology. Expenditure on this activity, exclusive of labor costs, was A$1.6 million, A$1.7
	million and A$1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively
	inclusive of the tax concession for research and development. Our policy is to focus our research
	on selected internal product development projects as well as external development programs under
	which we work in collaboration with other parties. See Item 4B Information on Metal Storm 
	Business Overview.



	D. Trend Information



	     We are a development stage company. Most of our technology requires further investment,
	research, development, testing and possibly regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales. We
	do not currently derive any revenue from the commercial sale of any applications of our technology.
	We cannot be sure of the extent to which the technology, or any products we develop, will be able
	to penetrate the potential markets and generate revenue. We believe that our future success depends
	on our ability to commercialize our technology. See Item 3D Key Information  Risk Factors.

	Terence J. ODwyer.

	Mr. ODwyer, a chartered accountant in Australia, has been a director of
	Metal Storm since 1998. He was Executive Chairman between April 2006 and February 2007, when he
	assumed the day to day management of Metal Storm but, in line with our cost reduction strategy, did
	not receive any compensation for this role. He is a past Chairman of BDO Kendalls, a large
	Queensland accountancy firm of which he had been a partner for 28 years until his retirement in
	2005. He is also a director of Bendigo Bank Limited and Qld Theatre Co.


	     

	John R. Nicholls.

	Mr. Nicholls was appointed as a Director in September 2006 pursuant to an
	agreement with Harmony Capital Partners Pte Limited who were sub-underwriters in connection with
	the Rights Offer. He has extensive experience in the Australian and international business
	communities with start-up and established companies, having held senior management positions and
	directorships for several Australian and international companies in the manufacturing,
	distribution, trading and merchant banking industries. He is a director of Nylex Limited and

	C. Board Practices



	     Under our constitution, our board of directors is required to be comprised of at least three
	directors. As of December 31, 2008, our board was comprised of five directors and is currently
	comprised of four directors. Our directors are elected to the board of directors for a three-year
	term and one-third of the directors retire by rotation at each annual general meeting of
	shareholders. Mr. John Nicholls was appointed as a Director in September 2006 pursuant to an
	agreement with Harmony in connection with the Rights Offer.


	     The board of directors has established an Audit Committee that consists of three directors.
	Current members of our Audit Committee are Mr. Trevor Tappenden (Chairman), Mr. John Nicholls and
	Mr. Terry ODwyer.


	     Under its charter, the Audit Committee:





	 



	



	 


	retains independent auditors and reviews and discusses the independence of the auditors;




	 




	 



	



	 


	sets the engagement policies for the independent auditors;




	 




	 



	



	 


	reviews and discusses the audit plan, the conduct of the audit and the audit results;




	 




	 



	



	 


	reviews and discusses financial statements and disclosures;




	 




	 



	



	 


	determines and administers internal audit procedures;




	 




	 



	



	 


	reviews and discusses the systems of internal accounting controls;




	 




	 



	



	 


	reviews and discusses the recommendations of independent auditors;




	 




	 



	



	 


	approves related party transactions; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	establishes procedures for complaints regarding financial statements or accounting policies.





	     The Audit Committee invites external auditors to attend Audit Committee meetings where
	appropriate. The Audit Committee also meets to receive reports from the external auditors
	concerning any matters that arise in connection with the performance of their role, including the
	adequacy of internal controls.


	     Our board of directors has established a Finance Committee that is intended to be an oversight
	body on capital raisings, mergers and acquisitions and the financial function of Metal Storms
	operations. The Board disbanded this committee in March 2008.


	     The board of directors has also established a Nominations and Remuneration Committee, whose
	members are: Mr. Nicholls and Mr. Tappenden. The board of directors remuneration objective is to
	motivate directors and management to pursue the long-term growth and success of Metal Storm within
	an appropriate control network.


	     The Nominations and Remuneration Committee reviews the compensation arrangements of all
	directors and executive officers on an annual basis and makes recommendations to the board. The
	Nominations and Remuneration Committee reviews and assesses the appropriateness of compensation
	arrangements of directors and executive officers by reference to relevant employment market
	conditions and with regard to performance based on set key performance indicators. Executive
	bonuses are linked to the achievement of pre-determined key performance indicators, and can also be
	granted based on the discretion of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee. In order to retain
	and attract executives of sufficient caliber to facilitate the efficient and effective management
	of our operations, the Nominations and Remuneration Committee seeks the advice of external advisers
	in connection with the structure of remuneration packages. It is the Nominations and Remuneration
	Committees policy that employment agreements are entered into with all executives.


	     Remuneration packages contain the following key elements:





	 



	



	 


	salary/fees;




	 




	 



	



	 


	benefits  including the provision of retirement and health benefits; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	incentive schemes  including performance-related bonuses and share options under the
	discretionary share option plan.

	     It is the Nominations and Remuneration Committees policy that payment of equity based
	remuneration to executive and non-executive directors is subject to shareholder approval. Metal
	Storm operates a discretionary employee option plan to enable the board of directors to provide an
	incentive to and to reward, full time executives and employees for the role that they play in the
	future success of Metal Storm. Invitations to participate in the discretionary employee option plan
	are at the absolute discretion of the board of directors. Invitations to participate in the
	employee option plan specify the details of the invitation, such as maximum number of shares, date
	by which the application must be made by the invitee, the exercise price, any conditions attached
	to the exercise of the option and any disposal restrictions. The exercise price is not less than
	the market value of Metal Storms shares on the date determined by the board of directors, and the
	aggregate number of shares subject to options cannot exceed 5% of Metal Storms shares then on
	issue. There are also individual limits on the number of options that may be granted to employees
	and individual limits on the number of shares that may be allotted and issued to employees upon
	exercise of the options. The exercise period for the options granted under the employee option plan
	is the earliest of (a) the third anniversary of the date of grant of the option; (b) the date on
	which any special circumstances including death, disability, redundancy, retirement or cessation of
	employment arise; (c) a takeover, compulsory acquisition, reconstruction, amalgamation or
	liquidation; and ending on the earliest of (d) the date which is 2 days before the tenth
	anniversary of the date of grant; (e) the last day before the first anniversary of the date on
	which any special circumstance arises; and (f) the expiry of specified time frames set out in the
	employee option plan in relation to the circumstances in (c) above. An option lapses upon expiry of
	the exercise period, termination of the option holders employment otherwise than in a special
	circumstance, upon the option holder being adjudicated bankrupt, or any purported transfer,
	assignment or alienation of the options by the option holder. The board of directors may at any
	time cease making further offers or invitations, but the subsisting rights of options are not
	affected in such circumstances. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts with Metal
	Storm.

	     We can grant options to purchase our shares to our directors and employees under our

	Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions




	A. Major Shareholders



	     The following table presents certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our
	ordinary shares as of April 24, 2009 by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more
	than 5% of our ordinary shares. Beneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission and generally means that a person has beneficial ownership of a
	security if he or she possesses sole or shared voting or investment power of that security, and
	includes options that are exercisable within 60 days. Information with respect to beneficial
	ownership has been furnished to us by each director, executive officer or 5% or more shareholder,
	as the case may be. Unless otherwise indicated, to our knowledge, each shareholder possesses sole
	voting and investment power over the shares listed, subject to community property laws where
	applicable.


	     All holders of our ordinary shares have the same voting rights.


	     The below table lists applicable percentage ownership based on 628,121,529 ordinary shares
	outstanding as of April 24, 2009. Options to purchase our ordinary shares that are exercisable or
	convertible notes that can be converted into ordinary shares within 60 days of April 24, 2009 are
	deemed to be beneficially owned by the persons holding these options for the purpose of computing
	percentage ownership of that person, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of
	computing any other persons ownership percentage.

	116,849,489 shares are owned by Mr. J.M. ODwyer, 43,526,182 shares are owned by ODwyer
	Investments Pty Ltd as trustee for the ODwyer Family Discretionary Trust and 105 shares owned by
	Rhonda Clare ODwyer in trust for Mr. J.M. ODwyer.





	     As of April 24, 2009, Harmony Investment Fund Ltd held 97,902,659 convertible notes and
	118,726,332 options. If all these options and convertible notes were exercised or converted at that
	date and no other optionholder or Noteholder converted their holdings, Harmony would hold
	approximately 46% of the ordinary shares in Metal Storm Limited. The diluting effect of this
	transaction would make Harmony the largest shareholder.


	     As of April 24, 2009, PNG Ports Corporation Limited held 22,500,000 convertible notes. If all
	these convertible notes were exercised or converted at that date and no other optionholder or
	Noteholder converted their holdings, PNG Ports Corporation Limited would hold approximately 10.8%
	of the ordinary shares in Metal Storm Limited.


	     As of April 24, 2009, 1.1% of our ordinary shares were held by 61 U.S. holders of record and
	97.5% of our ordinary shares were held by 8,723 Australian holders of record.


	     As of April 24, 2009, 6,036,159 American Depositary Shares, representing 120,723,180 ordinary
	shares, were outstanding.



	B. Related Party Transactions



	     During 2008, Backwell Lombard Capital Pty Ltd, of which our Director Terence ODwyer is a
	principal, was appointed to undertake consultancy work for Metal Storm. Fees paid totalled
	A$90,000 for services performed in 2008.

	     Our financial statements are included in Item 17 Financial Statements.



	Legal Proceedings



	     We are currently involved in arbitration proceedings in Arlington, Virginia in connection with
	a dispute arising out of a contract with StarChase LLC. StarChase LLC engaged Metal Storm to act
	as the lead systems integrator on the commercialization of the patented StarChase vehicle tagging
	technology. The contract required Metal Storm to generate a production ready configuration of the
	StarChase system, and to produce, implement, and provide support for a limited number of systems to
	be used for operational testing. We believe that we successfully met milestones under the contract
	entitling us to payments by StarChase LLC that have not been remitted and we have entered into
	arbitration. This arbitration is not expected to have a material impact on our financial program or
	financial position.


	     We are not involved in any other legal proceedings.



	Dividends



	     We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary stock and we do not
	anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Dividends may only be paid out of
	our profits. Payment of cash dividends, if any, in the future will be at the discretion of our
	board of directors or, if our directors do not exercise their power to issue dividends, our
	shareholders in a general meeting may exercise the powers. See Item 10 Additional Information 
	B. Constitution  Right to Share in Our Profits. Our Directors current intention is to reinvest
	any income in the continued development and operation of our business.



	B. Significant Changes

	B. Plan of Distribution



	     Not applicable.



	C. Markets




	     Our ordinary shares are traded on the Australian Securities Exchange and were listed on the
	NASDAQ Capital Market until July 2008 and, since then, quoted on the OTC market, in the form of
	American Depositary Shares.



	Exemptions from certain NASDAQ Corporate Governance Rules



	     Exemptions from the corporate governance standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market Inc. (Nasdaq)
	are available to foreign private issuers such as Metal Storm when those standards are contrary to a
	law, rule or regulation of any public authority exercising jurisdiction over such issuer or
	contrary to generally accepted business practices in the issuers country of domicile. In
	connection with Metal Storms NASDAQ Capital Market Listing Application, Nasdaq granted Metal Storm
	exemptions from certain corporate governance standards that were contrary to the laws, rules,
	regulations or generally accepted business practices in Australia. These exemptions claimed by
	Metal Storm during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 until the time of its delisting in July
	2008 are described below.





	 



	



	 


	Metal Storm was exempt from Nasdaqs independence requirements for a majority of the board
	of directors. The Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules did not require Metal Storm to have
	a majority of independent directors on the board during 2008. During most of the fiscal year ended
	December 31, 2008, Metal Storm did, however, have a majority of directors who were independent as
	defined in the Australian Securities Exchange Corporate Governance Principles, which definition
	differs from Nasdaqs definition. Accordingly, because Australian law and generally accepted
	business practices in Australia regarding director independence differ to Nasdaqs independence
	requirements, Metal Storm claimed this exemption in 2008.




	 




	 



	



	 


	Metal Storm was exempt from Nasdaqs quorum requirements applicable to meetings of
	shareholders. Consistent with Australian law, Metal Storms constitution provides that five
	shareholders present shall constitute a quorum for a general meeting. Nasdaq requires that an
	issuer provide for a quorum as specified in its by-laws for any meeting of the holders of common
	stock, which quorum may not be less than 33 1/3% of the outstanding shares of an issuers voting
	common stock. Accordingly, because applicable Australian law and rules governing quorums at
	shareholder meetings differ to Nasdaqs quorum requirements, Metal Storm claimed this exemption in
	2008.




	 




	 



	



	 


	Metal Storm was exempt from the Nasdaq requirement that an issuers auditors be subject to a
	peer review. Neither Australian law nor the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules required
	peer review of independent public accountants during 2008. Accordingly, Metal Storm claimed this
	exemption in 2008.




	 




	 



	



	 


	Metal Storm was exempt from the Nasdaq requirement that issuers obtain shareholder approval
	prior to the issuance of securities in connection with the establishment or amendment of certain
	stock option, purchase or other compensation plans. Applicable Australian law and rules differ to
	the Nasdaq requirements, with the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules providing generally
	for prior shareholder approval in numerous circumstances, including (i) issuance of equity
	securities exceeding 15% of the issued share capital of Metal Storm in any 12 month period (but in
	determining the 15% limit, securities issued under an exception to the rule or with shareholder
	approval are not counted), (ii) issuance of equity securities to related parties (as defined in the
	Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules), and (iii) directors or their associates acquiring
	securities under an employee incentive plan. Generally accepted business practices in Australia
	also provide for plans involving the issue of shares to directors and employees being capped






	33









	Table of Contents








	 


	 


	 


	at no more than 5% of the total number of
	shares on issue. Metal Storms Discretionary Share Option Scheme applies this 5% cap. Due to
	differences between Australian law and rules and the Nasdaq shareholder approval requirements,
	Metal Storm claimed this exemption in 2008.

	B. Our Constitution



	     We are a public company limited by shares registered under the Corporations Act 2001
	(Commonwealth of Australia) (Corporations Act) by the Australian Securities and Investments
	Commission (ASIC). We were registered as a private company in Queensland, Australia on April 13,
	1994 and our registered company number is 064 270 006. Our constituent document is a constitution
	which is similar in nature to the by-laws of a company incorporated under the laws of the U.S. Our
	constitution does not provide for or prescribe any specific objectives or purposes of Metal Storm.
	Our constitution is subject to the terms of the Listing Rules of the Australian Securities Exchange
	and the Corporations Act. Our constitution may be amended or repealed and replaced by special
	resolution of shareholders, which is a resolution passed by at least 75% of the votes cast by
	shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.


	     Our current constitution was adopted on May 14, 1999. Under Australian law, a company has the
	legal capacity and powers of an individual both inside and outside Australia. The material
	provisions of our constitution are summarized below. This summary is not intended to be complete,
	nor to constitute a definitive statement of the rights and liabilities of our shareholders and is
	qualified in its entirety by reference to the constitution, which is available on request.



	Directors



	     


	Interested Directors




	     A director may not vote in respect of any contract or arrangement in which the director has,
	directly or indirectly, any material interest according to our constitution. Such director may not
	be counted in the quorum present at the meeting and if the director does vote, such vote may not be
	counted. Either or both of these prohibitions may be relaxed or suspended to any extent by
	resolution passed at a general meeting of shareholders.


	     The Corporations Act prohibits directors of companies listed on the Australian Securities
	Exchange from voting on matters in which they have a material personal interest, requires
	disclosure of such interest to shareholders, and requires shareholders approval of any provision
	of related party benefits.


	     


	Directors Compensation




	     Our directors are paid remuneration for their services as directors, which is determined in a
	general meeting of shareholders. The aggregate, fixed sum for directors remuneration is to be
	divided among the directors in such proportion as the directors themselves agree, and in accordance
	with our constitution. The fixed sum remuneration for directors may not be increased except at a
	general meeting of shareholders and the particulars of the proposed increase are required to have
	been provided to shareholders in the notice convening the meeting.



	34









	Table of Contents





	     Pursuant to our constitution any director who devotes special attention to our business or who
	otherwise performs services which in the opinion of our board of directors are outside the scope of
	the ordinary duties of a director, or who at the request of the board of directors engages in any
	journey related to our business, may be paid extra remuneration which is determined by the board.


	     In addition to other remuneration provided in our constitution, all directors are entitled to
	be paid by us for reasonable travel accommodation and other expenses incurred by the directors in
	attending company meetings, board meetings, committee meetings or while engaged on our business.


	     Additionally in accordance with our constitution, a director may be paid a retirement benefit
	as determined by the board of directors in accordance with the Corporations Act and the Australian
	Securities Exchange Listing Rules.


	     


	Borrowing Powers Exercisable by Directors




	     Pursuant to our constitution, the management and control of our business affairs are vested in
	our board of directors. The board has the powers to raise or borrow money, guarantee the debts or
	obligations of any person and enter into any other financial arrangement, in each case in the
	manner and on the terms it thinks fit. The board may also charge any of our property or business or
	any uncalled capital and may issue debentures or give any other security for any of our debts,
	liabilities or obligations or of any other person, in each case, in the manner and on terms it
	deems fit.


	     


	Retirement of directors




	     Pursuant to our constitution, one third of directors other than the director who is the
	managing director, must retire from office at every annual general meeting. If the number of
	directors is not a multiple of three then the number nearest to but not less than one third must
	retire from office. The directors who retire in this manner are required to be the directors or
	director longest in office since last being elected. A director, other than the director who is a
	managing director, must retire from office at the conclusion of the third annual general meeting
	after which the director was elected.


	     


	Share Qualifications




	     There are no requirements under our constitution or elsewhere for directors to own our shares
	in order to qualify as directors.



	Rights and Restrictions on Classes of Shares



	     Subject to the Corporations Act and the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules, rights
	attaching to our shares are detailed in our constitution. Our constitution provides that any of our
	shares may be issued with preferred, deferred or other special rights, whether in relation to
	dividends, voting, return of share capital, payment of calls or otherwise as the board of directors
	may determine from time to time. Except as provided by contract or by our constitution to the
	contrary, all unissued shares are under the control of the board which may grant options on the
	shares, allot or otherwise dispose of the shares on the terms and conditions and for the
	consideration it deems fit. Currently our outstanding share capital consists of only one class of
	ordinary shares.


	     


	Dividend Rights




	     The board may from time to time determine to pay dividends to shareholders. All unclaimed
	dividends may be invested or otherwise made use of by the board for our benefit until claimed or
	otherwise disposed of in accordance with our constitution.


	     


	Voting Rights




	     Under our constitution, each shareholder has one vote determined by a show of hands at a
	meeting of the shareholders. On a poll vote each shareholder shall have one vote for each fully
	paid share and a fractional vote for each share which is not fully paid, such fraction being
	equivalent to the proportion of the amount which has been paid to such date on that share. Under
	Australian law, shareholders of a public company are not permitted to approve corporate matters by
	written consent. Our constitution does not provide for cumulative voting.


	     


	Right to Share in our Profits




	     Pursuant to our constitution, our shareholders are entitled to participate in our profits only
	by payment of dividends. The board may from time to time determine to pay dividends to the
	shareholders, however no dividend is payable except out of our profits. A declaration by the board
	as to the amount of our profits is conclusive.



	35

	Rights to Share in the Surplus in the Event of Liquidation




	     Our constitution provides for the right of shareholders to participate in a surplus in the
	event of our liquidation. In certain circumstances, any division may be otherwise than in
	accordance with the legal rights of the contributories, and in particular, any class may be given
	preferential or special rights or may be excluded altogether or in part from participation in a
	surplus in the event of liquidation. In the case of any division otherwise than in accordance with
	the legal rights of the contributories, any contributory who would be prejudiced by the division
	has a right to dissent and has ancillary rights, as if the determination were a special resolution
	passed pursuant to the Corporations Act relating to the sale or transfer of our assets by a
	liquidator or in a voluntary winding up.


	     


	Redemption Provisions




	     There are no redemption provisions in our constitution in relation to ordinary shares. Under
	our constitution and subject to the Corporations Act, any preference shares may be issued on the
	terms that they are, or may at our option be, liable to be redeemed.


	     


	Sinking Fund Provisions




	     There are no sinking fund provisions in our constitution in relation to ordinary shares.


	     


	Liability for Further Capital Calls




	     According to our constitution, the board may make any calls from time to time upon
	shareholders in respect of all monies unpaid on shares, subject to the terms upon which any of the
	shares have been issued. Each shareholder is liable to pay the amount of each call in the manner,
	at the time, and at the place specified by the board. Calls may be made payable by instalment.


	     


	Provisions Discriminating Against Holders of a Substantial Number of Shares




	     There are no provisions under our constitution discriminating against any existing or
	prospective holders of a substantial number of our shares.



	Variation of Share Rights



	     Our constitution provides that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares
	of such class, the rights attaching to any class of shares may, subject to the Australian
	Securities Exchange Listing Rules, be varied with the consent in writing of members with at least
	75% of the votes in the class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate
	meeting of the holders of the shares of such class. Our constitution also provides that the rights
	conferred upon holders of shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights are, unless
	otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, deemed not to be
	varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking equally with the first mentioned shares.
	These conditions are not more significant than required by the Corporations Act.



	General Meetings of Shareholders



	     General meetings of shareholders may be called by the board of directors. Except as permitted
	under the Corporations Act, shareholders may not convene a meeting. Under the Corporations Act,
	shareholders with at least 5% of the votes which may be cast at a general meeting may call and
	arrange to hold a general meeting. The Corporations Act requires the directors to call and arrange
	to hold a general meeting on the request of shareholders with at least 5% of the votes that may be
	cast at a general meeting or at least 100 shareholders who are entitled to vote at the general
	meeting. Twenty-eight days notice of the proposed meeting of our shareholders is required under
	the Corporations Act.


	     According to our constitution, the chairman of the general meeting may refuse admission to or
	exclude from the meeting, any person who is in possession of a picture recording or sound recording
	device, in possession of a placard or banner, in possession of an object considered by the chairman
	to be dangerous, offensive or liable to cause disruption, any person who refuses to produce or
	permit examination of any object, any person who behaves or threatens to behave in a dangerous,
	offensive or destructive manner, or any person who is not a director or one of our auditors, one of
	our shareholders or a proxy, attorney or representative of one of our shareholders.



	Foreign Ownership Regulation



	     There are no limitations on the rights to own securities imposed by our constitution. However,
	acquisitions and proposed acquisitions of shares in Australian companies may be subject to review
	and approval by the Australian Federal Treasurer under
	the Foreign Acquisitions and



	36









	Table of Contents





	Takeovers Act 1975 (Commonwealth of Australia). Generally this
	Act applies to acquisitions or proposed acquisitions:


	     (a) by a foreign person, as defined in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, or
	associated foreign persons which would result in such persons having an interest in 15% or more of
	the issued shares of, or control of 15% or more of the voting power in, an Australian company, and


	     (b) by a non-associated foreign person which would result in such foreign person having an
	interest in 40% or more of the issued shares of, or control of 40% or more of the voting power in,
	an Australian company.


	     The Australian Federal Treasurer may prevent a proposed acquisition in the above categories or
	impose conditions on such acquisition if the Treasurer is satisfied that the acquisition would be
	contrary to the national interest. If a foreign person acquires shares or an interest in shares in
	an Australian company in contravention of the Act, the Australian Federal Treasurer may order the
	divestiture of such persons shares or interest in shares in the company. The Australian Federal
	Treasurer may order divestiture pursuant to the Act if he determines that the acquisition has
	resulted in that foreign person, either alone or together with other non-associated or associated
	foreign persons, controlling the company and that such control is contrary to the national
	interest.



	Merger, Acquisition or Restructure



	     Our constitution indicates that where offers to purchase our shares have been made under a
	proportional takeover scheme, we are prohibited from registering a transfer which would give effect
	to the contract resulting from the acceptance of such an offer unless and until a resolution to
	approve the proportional takeover scheme is approved at a meeting by the persons entitled to vote
	on such resolution. The offeror or an associate of the offeror is not entitled to vote on such
	resolution. A person, other than an offeror or associate of the offeror, who, as at the end of the
	day in which the first offer under the proportional takeover scheme was made, held shares in that
	class of shares, is entitled to one vote for each of the shares held in that class.



	Ownership Threshold



	     There are no provisions in our constitution that require a shareholder to disclose ownership
	above a certain threshold. The Corporations Act, however, requires a substantial shareholder to
	notify us and the Australian Securities Exchange once a 5% interest in our shares is obtained.
	Further, once a shareholder owns a 5% interest in us, such shareholder must notify us and the
	Australian Securities Exchange of any increase or decrease of 1% or more in its holding of our
	shares.



	Conditions for Change of Capital



	     There are no conditions imposed by our constitution relating to changes in our capital which
	are more stringent than are required by the Corporations Act.



	Stock Issues and Takeover Attempts



	     We are governed by the Corporations Act which provides shareholders with broad protection in
	relation to takeovers, including:





	 



	



	 


	that the acquisition of control over voting shares takes place in a efficient, competitive
	and informed market;




	 




	 



	



	 


	that shareholders have enough information to assess the merits of a proposal; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	that shareholders all have a reasonable and equal opportunity to participate in any
	benefits accruing to the shareholders through any proposal under which a person would
	acquire a substantial interest.





	     Further, subject to certain limited exceptions provided in the Australian Securities Exchange
	Listing Rules, we must not issue or agree to issue shares, without the approval of holders of our
	ordinary shares, for three months after we are told in writing that a person is making or proposes
	to make, a takeover for our shares.


	     The exceptions to the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules are as follows:





	 



	



	 


	an issuance or agreement to issue which we have notified the Australian Securities
	Exchange of before we are told a person is making or proposes to make a takeover offer for
	our shares;




	 




	 



	



	 


	an issuance to our ordinary shareholders on a pro-rata basis;




	 




	 



	



	 


	an issuance made due to an exercise of rights of conversion
	already in existence;



	 




	 



	



	 


	an issuance by us as consideration for an off-market takeover bid made by us where we are
	required to comply with the provisions of the Corporations Act;




	 




	 



	



	 


	an issuance under a dividend stock distribution plan that is in operation before we are
	told a person is making or proposes to make a takeover for our shares; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	if there is an agreement to issue shares and such agreement is conditional on ordinary
	shareholders approving the issuance before the issuance is made.






	37









	Table of Contents










	Access to and Inspection of Documents



	     Inspection of our records is governed by the Corporations Act. Any member of the public has
	the right to inspect or obtain copies of our company registers on the payment of a prescribed fee.
	Shareholders are not required to pay a fee for inspection of our registers or minute books of the
	meetings of shareholders. Other corporate records including minutes of directors meetings,
	financial records and other documents are not open for inspection by shareholders. Where a
	shareholder is acting in good faith and an inspection is deemed to be made for a proper purpose, a
	shareholder may apply to the court to make an order for inspection of our books.



	CHESS



	     We participate in the Clearing House Electronic Sub-Register System, known as CHESS, which is
	maintained by the CHESS Securities Clearing House pursuant to the Australian Securities Exchange
	Listing Rules and the Securities Clearing House business rules. CHESS is an automated, electronic
	transfer and settlement system with no requirement for physical title or transfer documents.
	Accordingly, the legal registered record of holding balances for our CHESS-approved shares are
	recorded on either of the electronic CHESS sub-register or the electronic issuer sponsored
	sub-register, which together form the complete company register. We do not issue share certificates
	to shareholders. Instead, we provide shareholders with a holding statement (similar to a bank
	account statement) that sets out the number of ordinary shares registered in each shareholders
	name. This statement also advised shareholders of their holder identification number or shareholder
	reference number and relevant particulars. If a shareholding changes during any month, shareholders
	will receive a statement after the end of that month. Shareholders may also request statements at
	any other time (subject to payment of a small administration fee).



	C. Material Contracts



	     

	Terms of convertible notes



	     The terms of the convertible notes were set out in the Rights Offer prospectus that was
	approved by the Board of Metal Storm in July 2006. At the maturity date of September 1, 2009
	(Maturity Date), Metal Storm must repay the face value of A$0.135 to the holders of convertible
	notes (Noteholders), unless the Noteholders have elected to convert some or all of their
	convertible notes into ordinary shares at a conversion price which is the lesser of A$0.135 per
	share and 90% of the volume weighted average closing price of ordinary shares during the 30
	business days immediately preceding the conversion date. Noteholders can elect to convert some or
	all of their convertible notes into ordinary shares at the beginning of each quarter, at the
	Maturity Date and at certain other times.


	     Metal Storm cannot redeem any convertible notes prior to the Maturity Date. On the Maturity
	Date, the convertible notes must be redeemed by Metal Storm paying to the Noteholder the face value
	of the notes (unless the Noteholder has previously elected to convert their notes into ordinary
	shares). On the occurrence of an event of default (examples of which are set out below), if
	required by ANZ Executors & Trustee Company Limited (Trustee), Metal Storm must redeem all the
	convertible notes on issue by paying to the Noteholders the face value together with all accrued
	but unpaid interest at the date of redemption.


	     Interest is payable on the face value at a rate of 10% per annum. Interest is payable
	quarterly in arrears on the last day of each quarter until the earlier of conversion or redemption
	of the convertible notes. Until conversion or redemption, the convertible notes are unsecured debt
	obligations of Metal Storm and rank equally with other ordinary unsecured creditors. The
	convertible notes rank behind any of our secured creditors but rank ahead of shares outstanding.
	Each share issued on conversion of the notes will rank equally with all existing shares then on
	issue. The convertible notes do not carry any entitlement to participate in rights offers, any
	returns of capital, bonus issue or capital reconstruction.


	     

	Trust Deed in connection with the Rights Offer



	     On July 11, 2006, Metal Storm entered into a trust deed with ANZ the Trustee in connection
	with the Rights Offer. Under the agreement, the Trustee has agreed to hold on trust for the
	Noteholders, the right to enforce Metal Storms obligation to repay the face value of the
	convertible notes.


	     The Trustee has covenanted that it will exercise reasonable diligence to ascertain whether
	Metal Storm has committed any breach of the terms applicable to convertible notes, the Trust Deed
	or Chapter 2L of the Corporations Act.

	     An event of default under the terms of the Trust Deed includes, but is not limited to, if
	Metal Storm:





	 



	



	 


	fails to pay principal or interest in respect of any convertible note within 5 business
	days after it becomes due and payable;




	 




	 



	

	D. Exchange Controls



	     The Australian dollar is convertible into U.S. dollars at freely floating rates. There are no

	Commonwealth of Australia has, however enacted laws to make effective the United Nations Security
	Council resolutions that impose a freeze on financial assets and foreign exchange dealings with
	certain persons and entities. In addition, transactions involving the transfer of funds or payments
	to, by the order of, or on behalf of prescribed entities, or any undertaking owned or controlled
	directly or indirectly, by prescribed entities, are not permitted without the specific approval of
	the Reserve Bank of Australia.



	E. Taxation



	     The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax and Australian tax
	consequences to U.S. holders, as defined below, of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of
	American Depositary Shares (ADSs) or ordinary shares and is based on the laws in force as at the
	date of this annual report. Holders are advised to consult their tax advisors concerning the
	overall tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares
	in their particular circumstances. This discussion is not intended, and should not be construed, as
	legal or professional tax advice. This discussion relies in part on representations by the
	depositary in the deposit agreement and related documents and the assumption that each obligation
	in the deposit agreement and related documents will be performed in accordance with their terms.



	U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations



	     


	To ensure compliance with U.S. Treasury Department Circular 230, investors are hereby notified
	that: (a) any discussion of U.S. Federal tax issues in this document is not intended or written by
	Metal Storm to be relied upon, and cannot be relied upon by investors in the ADSs or ordinary
	shares, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on investors in the ADSs or
	ordinary shares under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), (b) such
	discussion is written in connection with the promotion or marketing of the transactions or matters
	addressed herein by Metal Storm, and (c) investors in the ADSs or ordinary shares should seek
	advice based on their particular circumstances from their own independent tax advisors. U.S.
	counsel does not intend to be, and is not, engaged in the promotion or marketing of the
	transactions or matters described in this offering memorandum, and no inference to the contrary
	shall be implied by reason of the U.S. tax discussion set forth herein.

	Table of Contents





	     In this section, we discuss certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable
	to an investment in ADSs, which are evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), or ordinary
	shares by a U.S. holder, as defined below, that will hold the ADSs or ordinary shares as capital
	assets within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). We do not
	discuss any tax considerations that may apply to holders subject to special tax rules, such as
	banks, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, tax-exempt entities, persons
	subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons that hold ADSs or ordinary shares as a position in
	a straddle or as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion transaction for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes, persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, persons
	that own 10% or more of our equity or persons that are not U.S. holders.


	     This section is based on the Code, income tax regulations issued under the Code, and judicial
	and administrative interpretations of the Code and the income tax regulations, all as of the date
	of this annual report. All of the foregoing are subject to change at any time, and any change could
	be retroactive.


	     In this section, a U.S. holder means a beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares that is,
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes:





	 



	



	 


	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes;




	 




	 



	



	 


	a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state
	thereof or the District of Columbia;




	 




	 



	



	 


	an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of
	its source; or




	 




	 



	



	 


	a trust the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a court in
	the United States and for which one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
	substantial decisions.





	     If a partnership holds ADSs or ordinary shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a
	partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
	Partners of partnerships that will hold ADSs or ordinary shares should consult their tax advisors.


	     


	You should consult your tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, as well as state, local
	and non-U.S., tax consequences to you of an investment in ADSs or ordinary shares.




	     


	Ownership of ADSs in General




	     A beneficial owner of ADSs will be treated as the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares
	represented by such ADSs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, no gain or loss will be
	recognized by a U.S. Holder upon the exchange of ADSs for the ordinary shares represented by such
	ADSs. A U.S. Holders tax basis in an ADS generally will equal the cost of such ADS to such U.S.
	Holder. A U.S. Holders tax basis in the ordinary shares received upon an exchange of ADSs for
	ordinary shares will be the same as its tax basis in the surrendered ADSs and the holding period
	for ordinary shares received will include the period during which the holder held such ADSs.


	     


	Dividends




	     Subject to the passive foreign investment company rules, discussed below, U.S. holders will
	include as dividend income gross amount of any distributions of cash or property (without deduction
	for any withholding tax), other than certain

	pro rata

	distributions of ordinary shares, with
	respect to ADSs or ordinary shares to the extent the distributions are made from our current or
	accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder
	will include the dividend income at the time of receipt, which, for a holder of ADSs, generally
	will be the date of receipt by the depositary. To the extent, if any, that the amount of any
	distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as so determined, it
	will be treated first as a tax-free return of the U.S. holders tax basis in the ADSs or ordinary
	shares and thereafter as capital gain. Dividends paid by us will not be eligible for the
	dividends-received deduction generally allowed to U.S. corporate shareholders.


	     For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011, certain dividends received by an
	individual U.S. holder (as well as certain trusts and estates) from a qualified foreign
	corporation are eligible for preferential rates of taxation. We believe that we are a qualified
	foreign corporation with respect to our ordinary shares because we should be eligible for benefits
	under the Double Taxation Convention between Australia and the United States. The U.S Treasury
	Department has announced its intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which U.S. Holders of the
	ordinary shares or ADSs and intermediaries through whom such ordinary shares or ADSs are held will
	be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers to establish that dividends are treated as
	qualified dividends. Because such rules have not yet been issued, it is not clear whether we will
	be in a position to comply with them. A qualified foreign corporation generally does not include
	any foreign corporation that is a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year in which
	the dividend is paid or for the preceding taxable year. Because we likely were a passive foreign
	investment company for 2008 (as discussed below), we do not expect to be a qualified foreign
	corporation for 2009 even if we are a passive foreign investment company for 2009. If we are a
	qualified foreign corporation with respect to ADSs or ordinary shares,
	then dividends with respect to such shares generally would be eligible for the preferential
	tax rates, except to the



	40









	Table of Contents





	extent that the individual (1) holds the relevant share of stock for 60
	days or less during the 120-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date (or, in the
	case of certain preferred stock, 90 days or less during the 180-day period beginning 90 days before
	the ex-dividend date) as measured under Section 246(c) of the Code, (2) is under an obligation
	(whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions
	in substantially similar or related property or (3) elects to treat the dividend as investment
	income for purposes of determining the amount of deductible investment interest under Section
	163(d)(4)(B) of the Code. Further, if an individual receives, with respect to any share of stock,
	an extraordinary dividend (within the meaning of Section 1059(c) of the Code) eligible for the
	preferential tax rates, any loss on a subsequent sale of the stock is treated as a long-term
	capital loss to the extent of the extraordinary dividend.


	     Includible distributions paid in Australian dollars, including any Australian withholding
	taxes, will be included in the gross income of a U.S. holder in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by
	reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the
	Australian dollars are converted into U.S. dollars at that time. If Australian dollars are
	converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. holder generally should not be required
	to recognize any foreign exchange gain or loss.


	     If Australian dollars so received are not converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt,
	the U.S. holder will have a basis in the Australian dollars equal to their U.S. dollar value on the
	date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the Australian
	dollars generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to such U.S. holder and generally such
	gain or loss will be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit
	limitation purposes.


	     Dividends received by a U.S. holder with respect to ADSs or ordinary shares will be treated as
	foreign source income, which may be relevant in calculating the holders foreign tax credit
	limitation. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with
	respect to specific classes of income. For these purposes, dividends will be categorized as
	passive category income, or in certain cases as general category income.


	     Subject to certain complex limitations, a U.S. holder generally will be entitled to a credit
	against its U.S. federal income tax liability or a deduction in computing its U.S. federal taxable
	income in respect of any Australian taxes withheld by us. A U.S. holder who elects a deduction for
	Australian taxes withheld by us must do so with respect to all foreign taxes paid or accrued in
	such taxable year.


	     You should consult your tax advisor as to the consequences of Australian withholding taxes and
	the availability of a foreign tax credit or deduction. See Australian Tax ConsiderationsTaxation
	of Dividends.


	     


	Sale or Exchange of ADSs or Ordinary Shares




	     Subject to the passive foreign investment company rules, discussed below, a U.S. holder
	generally will recognize gain or loss on a disposition, including a sale, exchange or redemption,
	of ADSs or ordinary shares equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition
	and the U.S. holders tax basis in the ADSs or ordinary shares. This gain or loss will generally be
	long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the ADSs or ordinary shares for more
	than one year and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of
	individuals are eligible for preferential rates of taxation, which have been reduced for long-term
	capital gains recognized on or after May 6, 2003, and before January 1, 2011. Short-term capital
	gains are taxed at the rates applicable to ordinary income, which, for gains recognized on or after
	May 6, 2003, and before January 1, 2011, are higher than the rates applicable to dividends. For
	foreign tax credit limitation purposes, gain or loss recognized upon a disposition generally will
	be treated as from sources within the United States. The deductibility of capital losses is subject
	to limitations for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


	     You should consult your tax advisor regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit or
	deduction in respect of any Australian tax imposed on a sale or other disposition of ADSs or
	ordinary shares. See Australian Tax Considerations  Tax on Sales or other Dispositions of
	Shares.


	     


	Passive Foreign Investment Company Status




	     The Code provides special anti-deferral rules regarding certain distributions received by U.S.
	shareholders with respect to, and sales and other dispositions, including pledges, of shares of
	stock of, a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). A foreign corporation will be treated as a
	PFIC for any taxable year if 75% or more of its gross income for the taxable year is passive income
	or the average percentage of its assets, generally by value, that produce or are held for the
	production of passive income is at least 50%. Passive income for this purpose generally includes,
	among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from commodities and
	securities transactions. In determining whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC, a pro-rata portion
	of the income and assets of each corporation in which it owns, at least a 25% interest (by value)
	is taken into account.



	41









	Table of Contents





	     We believe that we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004,
	2005, 2006 and 2008, but not in 2001 and 2007. Metal Storm could be a PFIC again in 2009.


	     As noted above, dividends received by an individual from a qualified foreign corporation are
	eligible for preferential rates of taxation. A qualified foreign corporation generally does not
	include any foreign corporation that is a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid
	or for the preceding taxable year.


	     A U.S. shareholder that holds stock in a foreign corporation during any taxable year in which
	the corporation qualifies as a PFIC is subject to tax under the excess distribution rules unless
	the shareholder elects to treat the PFIC as a qualified electing fund (QEF) or makes a
	mark-to-market election, each as discussed below. An excess distribution is a distribution with
	respect to PFIC stock that exceeds 125% of the average of such distributions over the preceding
	three-year period or, if shorter, the shareholders holding period for its shares. Excess
	distributions are allocated ratably to each day of the U.S. shareholders holding period. Amounts
	allocated to the current taxable year and any years before the corporation was a PFIC are currently
	included in gross income as ordinary income. Amounts allocated to other taxable years are taxed at
	the highest ordinary income tax rates in effect for those years, and the tax for each such prior
	year is subject to an interest charge at the rate applicable to income tax deficiencies. In
	addition, the entire amount of any gain that a U.S. shareholder realizes upon a sale or other
	disposition of shares in a PFIC is considered an excess distribution subject to tax and interest as
	described above. A U.S. shareholder that acquires shares in a PFIC from a decedent generally will
	not receive a stepped-up fair market value tax basis in such shares but, instead, will receive a
	tax basis equal to the decedents basis, if lower. If a corporation is a PFIC for any taxable year
	during which a U.S. shareholder holds shares in the corporation, then the corporation generally
	will continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to the shareholders shares, even if the
	corporation no longer satisfies either the passive income or passive assets test described above,
	unless the U.S. shareholder terminates this deemed PFIC status by electing to recognize gain, which
	will be taxed under the excess distribution rules as if such shares had been sold on the last day
	of the last taxable year for which the corporation was a PFIC.


	     The excess distribution rules may be avoided if a U.S. shareholder makes a QEF election
	effective beginning with the first taxable year in the shareholders holding period in which the
	corporation is a PFIC. A U.S. shareholder that makes a QEF election is required to include in
	income its

	pro rata

	share of the PFICs ordinary earnings and net capital gain as ordinary income
	and long-term capital gain, respectively, subject to a separate election to defer payment of taxes,
	which deferral is subject to an interest charge. A U.S. shareholder whose QEF election is effective
	after the first taxable year during the shareholders holding period in which the corporation is a
	PFIC (an unpedigreed QEF election) will continue to be subject to the excess distribution rules
	for years beginning with such first taxable year and prior to the year in which the QEF election
	first becomes effective, unless the shareholder elects to recognize as an excess distribution any
	gain that the shareholder would have recognized if the shares were sold on the first day of the
	first taxable year for which the QEF election is effective. Although an option to acquire PFIC
	stock generally is treated as PFIC stock for purposes of the excess distribution rules, a QEF
	election with respect to a shareholders shares will not apply to the shareholders options. If a
	shareholder that owns PFIC shares subject to a QEF election acquires additional shares pursuant to
	the exercise of an option, the additional shares will be subject to the QEF election, but the
	election may be an unpedigreed QEF election with respect to those shares.


	     In general, a U.S. shareholder makes a QEF election by attaching a completed Internal Revenue
	Service (IRS) Form 8621 to a timely filed (taking into account extensions) U.S. federal income
	tax return for the year beginning with which the QEF election is to be effective. (A U.S.
	shareholder of a PFIC must file an IRS Form 8621 annually regardless of whether or not it makes a
	QEF election.) In certain circumstances, a U.S. shareholder may be able to make a retroactive QEF
	election. In order for a U.S. shareholder to make a valid QEF election, the corporation must
	annually provide or make available to the shareholder certain information. A QEF election can be
	revoked only with the consent of the IRS. Metal Storm does not provide to U.S. holders the
	information required to make a valid QEF election, and makes no undertaking to provide such
	information in the future.


	     As an alternative to making a QEF election, a U.S. shareholder may make a mark-to-market
	election with respect to its PFIC shares if the shares meet certain minimum trading requirements. A
	U.S. shareholder that makes a mark-to-market election will be required to include in income each
	year an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares that the shareholder owns
	as of the close of the taxable year over the shareholders adjusted tax basis in the shares. The
	U.S. shareholder will be entitled to a deduction for the excess, if any, of the shareholders
	adjusted tax basis in the shares over the fair market value of the shares as of the close of the
	taxable year; provided, however, that the deduction will be limited to the extent of any net
	mark-to-market gains with respect to the shares included by the U.S. shareholder under the election
	for prior taxable years. The U.S. shareholders basis in the shares will be adjusted to reflect the
	amounts included or deducted pursuant to the election. Amounts included in income pursuant to a
	mark-to-market election, as well as gain on the sale or exchange of the shares, will be treated as
	ordinary income. The deductible portion of any mark-to-market loss, as well as loss on a sale or
	exchange of shares to the extent that the amount of such loss does not exceed net mark-to-market
	gains previously included in income, will be treated as ordinary loss.



	42









	Table of Contents





	     The mark-to-market election applies to the taxable year for which the election is made and all
	subsequent taxable years, unless the shares cease to meet applicable trading requirements or the
	IRS consents to its revocation. The excess distribution rules generally do not apply to a U.S.
	shareholder for tax years for which a mark-to-market election is in effect. However, if a U.S.
	shareholder makes a mark-to-market election for PFIC stock after the beginning of the shareholders
	holding period for the stock, a coordination rule applies to ensure that the shareholder does not
	avoid the tax and interest charge with respect to amounts attributable to periods before the
	election.


	     A mark-to-market election is available to a U.S. holder only if the shares are considered
	marketable for these purposes. Shares will be considered marketable if they are regularly traded
	on certain U.S. stock exchanges or certain non-U.S. stock exchanges. For these purposes, shares
	will be considered regularly traded during any calendar year during which they are traded, other
	than in negligible quantities, on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter. Any trades that
	have as their principal purpose, meeting these requirements will be disregarded. It is not clear
	whether our ADSs or ordinary shares will meet the minimum trading requirements necessary to permit
	a U.S. holder to make a mark-to-market election with respect to them.


	     


	U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the effect on them of the PFIC
	rules and the desirability of making, and the availability of, either a QEF election or a
	mark-to-market election with respect to our ADSs or ordinary shares. Metal Storm provides no advice
	on your taxation matters. The above should not be taken as advice by the reader of this document.






	Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting Requirements




	     U.S. backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements generally apply to payments
	to non-corporate holders of ADSs or ordinary shares. Information reporting will apply to payments
	of dividends on, and to proceeds from the disposition of, ADSs or ordinary shares by a paying agent
	within the United States to a U.S. holder, other than an exempt recipient, including a
	corporation and certain other persons that, when required, demonstrate their exempt status. A
	paying agent within the United States will be required to withhold at the applicable statutory
	rate, currently 28%, in respect of any payments of dividends on, and the proceeds from the
	disposition of, ADSs or ordinary shares within the United States to a U.S. holder, other than an
	exempt recipient, if the holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or
	otherwise fails to comply with applicable backup withholding requirements. U.S. holders who are
	required to establish their exempt status generally must provide IRS Form W-9 (Request for
	Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification).


	     Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be
	credited against a U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax liability. A U.S. holder may obtain a
	refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim
	for refund with the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner and furnishing any required
	information.


	     


	The discussion above is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax
	considerations applicable to an investment in ADSs or ordinary shares. You should consult with your
	tax advisor concerning the tax consequences to you in your particular situation.




	     

	Australian Tax Considerations



	     In this section we discuss the material Australian tax considerations related to the
	acquisition, ownership and disposal by the absolute beneficial owners of ADSs which are evidenced
	by ADRs, or ordinary shares. This discussion is based upon existing Australian tax law as of the
	date of this annual report, which is subject to change, possibly retrospectively. This discussion
	does not address all aspects of Australian income tax law which may be important to particular
	investors in light of their individual investment circumstances, such as ADSs or shares held by
	investors subject to special tax rules (for example, financial institutions, insurance companies or
	tax exempt organizations). In addition, this summary does not discuss any foreign or state tax
	considerations, other than stamp duty. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax
	advisors regarding the Australian and foreign income and other tax considerations of the purchase,
	ownership and disposition of the ADSs or shares. This summary is based upon the premise that the
	holder is not an Australian tax resident.


	     


	Nature of ADRs for Australian Taxation Purposes




	     ADSs held by a U.S. holder will be treated for Australian taxation purposes as held under a
	bare trust for such holder. Consequently, the underlying ordinary shares will be regarded as
	owned by the ADS holder for Australian income tax and capital gains tax purposes. Dividends paid on
	the underlying ordinary shares will also be treated as dividends paid to the ADS holder, as the
	person beneficially entitled to those dividends. Therefore, in the following analysis we discuss
	the tax consequences to non-Australian resident holders of ordinary shares which, for Australian
	taxation purposes, will be the same as to U.S. holders of ADSs.

	Table of Contents





	     


	Taxation of Dividends




	     Australia operates a dividend imputation system under which dividends may be declared to be
	franked to the extent of tax paid on company profits. Fully franked dividends are not subject to
	dividend withholding tax. Dividends payable by Metal Storm to non-Australian resident shareholders
	will be subject to dividend withholding tax, to the extent the dividends are unfranked. Dividend
	withholding tax will be imposed at 30%, unless a shareholder is a resident of a country with which
	Australia has a double taxation agreement. Under the provisions of the current Double Taxation
	Convention between Australia and the United States, the Australian tax withheld on unfranked
	dividends paid by us to which a resident of the United States is beneficially entitled is limited
	to 15%, unless the shares are effectively connected to a permanent establishment or fixed base in
	Australia through which the shareholder carries on business or provides independent personal
	services, respectively.


	     If a company that is a non-Australian resident shareholder owns a 10% or more interest, the
	Australian tax withheld on dividends paid by us to which a resident of the United States is
	beneficially entitled is limited to 5%.


	     


	Tax on Sales or other Dispositions of SharesCapital gains tax




	     Non-Australian resident shareholders will not be subject to Australian capital gains tax on
	the gain made on a sale or other disposal of our shares, unless they, together with associates,
	hold 10% or more of our issued capital at any time during the five years before the disposal of the
	shares. There are proposed changes to the current legislation, which would exempt holdings of 10%
	or more of issued capital from Australian capital gains tax. At the present time it is uncertain
	when these proposed changes might take effect.


	     Currently, a non-Australian resident shareholder who owns a 10% or more interest would be
	subject to Australian capital gains tax to the same extent as Australian resident shareholders. The
	Australian Taxation Office maintains the view that Australian capital gains tax is not limited by
	the Double Taxation Convention between the United States and Australia. Australian capital gains
	tax applies to net capital gains at a taxpayers marginal tax rate but for certain shareholders a
	discount of the capital gain may apply if the shares have been held for 12 months or more. For
	individuals, this discount is 50%. Net capital gains are calculated after reduction for capital
	losses, which may only be offset against capital gains.


	     


	Tax on Sales or other Dispositions of SharesShareholders Holding Shares on Revenue Account




	     Some non-Australian resident shareholders may hold shares on revenue rather than on capital
	account, for example, share traders. These shareholders may have the gains made on the sale or
	other disposal of the shares included in their assessable income under the ordinary income
	provisions of the income tax law, if the gains are sourced in Australia.


	     Non-Australian resident shareholders assessable under these ordinary income provisions in
	respect of gains made on shares held on revenue account would be assessed for such gains at the
	Australian tax rates for non-Australian residents, which start at a marginal rate of 29%. Some
	relief from Australian income tax may be available to such non-Australian resident shareholders
	under the Double Taxation Convention between the United States and Australia, for example, because
	the shareholder does not have a permanent establishment in Australia.


	     To the extent an amount would be included in a non-Australian resident shareholders
	assessable income under both the capital gains tax provisions and the ordinary income provisions,
	the capital gain amount would generally be reduced, so that the shareholder would not be subject to
	double tax on any part of the income gain or capital gain.


	     


	Dual Residency




	     If a shareholder were a resident of both Australia and the United States under those
	countries domestic taxation laws, that shareholder may be subject to tax as an Australian
	resident. If, however, the shareholder is determined to be a U.S. resident for the purposes of the
	Double Taxation Convention between the United States and Australia, the Australian tax would be
	subject to limitation by the Double Taxation Convention. Shareholders should obtain specialist
	taxation advice in these circumstances.


	     


	Stamp Duty




	     A transfer of shares through trading on the Australian Securities Exchange, whether by
	Australian residents or foreign residents, is not subject to Queensland stamp duty.

	Australian Death Duty




	     Australia does not have estate or death duties. No capital gains tax liability is realized
	upon the inheritance of a deceased persons shares. The disposal of inherited shares by
	beneficiaries, may, however, give rise to a capital gains tax liability.


	     


	Goods and Services Tax




	     The issue or transfer of shares will not incur Australian goods and services tax.



	F. Dividends and Paying Agents



	     Not applicable.



	G. Statements by Experts



	     Not applicable.



	H. Documents on Display



	     We are subject to the periodic reporting and other informational requirements of the Exchange
	Act. Under the Exchange Act, we are required to file reports and other information with the SEC.
	Copies of reports and other information, when so filed, may be inspected without charge and may be
	obtained at prescribed rates at the public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at 100 F.
	Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information regarding the Washington,
	D.C. Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The public may also view our
	annual reports and other documents filed with the SEC on the internet at

	www.sec.gov

	. As a
	foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the
	furnishing and content of quarterly reports and proxy statements, and our officers, directors and
	principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions in
	Section 16 of the Exchange Act.



	I. Subsidiary Information



	     Not applicable.









	Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk



	     We invest excess cash in term deposits with high-quality financial institutions. We do not
	utilize derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments, positions or
	transactions in any material manner. Accordingly, we believe that we are not subject to any
	material risks arising from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
	prices, equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Since
	we do not invest in locations outside Australia, we are not subject to cross-border risks, with the
	exceptions of risk set out immediately below.


	     We operate in Australia and the United States and, as a result, are subject to certain foreign
	currency exposure. Historically, currency translation gains and losses have been reflected as
	adjustments to shareholders equity, while transaction gains and losses have been reflected as
	components of income and loss. Transaction gains and losses could be material depending upon
	changes in the exchange rate relationships between the Australian dollar and the U.S. dollar. See
	Item 5A Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Operating ResultsEffects of Currency
	Fluctuations above for a detailed description of the impact of foreign currency translation on our
	financial statements.


	     In addition, convertible notes issued by Metal Storm have an embedded derivative which is
	required to be fair valued to market at each balance date. As such we are subject to fluctuations
	in our market price, interest rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive
	instruments.


	     We also hold floating rate notes that consist of interests in collateralized debt obligations
	supported by pools of residential and commercial mortgages and other structured credits. The
	floating rate notes are fair valued to market at each balance date. Resultantly, the valuation of
	these investments at any one time is dependent upon prevailing market conditions including market
	liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, these investments had a face value of A$1,000,000 and a fair
	value based on market conditions of A$10,000. As such, our exposure to price risk as of December
	31, 2008 was A$10,000. During the fiscal year, however, our exposure to price risk was
	substantially more than A$10,000. For the first half of 2008, the price risk of the floating rate
	notes was A$779,200 and, for the second half of 2008, the price risk was A$557,600.


	     Refer footnote 3 on page F-19 for further information.
