REACH NEW HEIGHTS
WE'LL HELP TAKE YOU FURTHER.






WE ARE HAWK CAPITAL
Hawk Capital Partners is a private equity firm that seeks to make control investments in businesses operating in the lower middle market. Working with in-place management teams or ownership groups, we collaboratively develop a long-term plan to capitalize on growth opportunities in those businesses or otherwise identify tangible ways to improve the businesses. Because we are investing on a long-term basis and do not have limited partners, we execute on the plan without the "noise" and pressure of having to realize a capital event. We focus on getting the process right and then afford the necessary time for our theses to unfold.



STRATEGIC FOCUS


We are focused on acquiring businesses with exceptional management teams and partnering with those teams to unlock value.





STRATEGIC GROWTH


At Hawk Capital, we seek to acquire businesses that have significant growth opportunities that can be harnessed through operational improvements, capturing market share through add-on acquisitions, leveraging technology (including Internet sales channels), improving efficiencies in the capital structure or otherwise.





STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE


We manage our own capital so there is no time horizon for us to exit an investment. Without limited partners, we can move quickly to make our investments and be patient over the long term to build the best businesses we can. At Hawk Capital, we have extensive track records managing businesses, in numerous industries through all economic cycles and creating extraordinary returns.

Profile






















About Us
Hawkhill Partners Ltd. (HPL) is an affiliate of the Hawkhill Group of companies. Hawkhill can trace its roots back to 1995 as a Norwegian energy and investment advisory firm based in the United States. Today, Hawkhill is focused a broad range of development opportunities in the East and Central Africa region with specializations in energy, financial services, professional services, technology, real estate and private equity as six important drivers of rural, peri-urban and small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) development in the region.
READ MORE...













Difference
Our approach is different from foreign consulting firms. We maintain international standards but we have adapted our products, services and pricing models to local market conditions. This allows us to serve startups and SMEs at prices they can afford. At the same time, we maintain the infrastructure to service medium and large organizations such as financial institutions. Our differentiation is rooted in Tier I talent, technology and years of experience working for-profit in Africa.

 
READ MORE...













Development 
Hawkhill’s move to Africa in 2011 was inspired by the convergence of our human development focus with a once-in-a-century business opportunity. We predicted then that global asset movements would target East African SMEs and three years later, our research has been verified by international consulting firms and private equity funds. The increased role of private sector investment in Africa is a welcome trend that could transform high-growth frontier markets into thriving consumer economies. 


 










 


Africa
Due in large part to prolonged economic woes in the West brought on by the U.S. housing crisis and Euro crisis in 2008-9, Asian emerging markets became increasingly popular destinations for investment, which quickly resulted in capital market saturation and diminishing returns for investors. Where have investors started moving next? The answer is Africa.
Africa’s economic and demographic statistics are impressive.
 o    	According to the International Monetary Fund, 11 of the world’s 20 fastest growing economies will be in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2020 (IMF, October 2015).
 o    	World Bank data shows the population is growing at 2.7% and 75% of the population is younger than age 35.
 o    	PriceWaterhouse Coopers predicts that investment in Africa will grow at 12% CAGR until 2020 (PwC, 2015).
 o    	McKinsey estimates that private equity investment in East African SMEs will grow at 14% CAGR from 2014-2018, faster than any other asset class in Africa (McKinsey & Co., 2014).



 











East Africa 
Africa is a natural destination for international investment, and East Africa has unique advantages over the other regions.
o	East Africa shares borders with 4 out of Africa’s 5 fastest growing economies this year.
o	Strategically located between Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
o	Diversified economy with very recent major discoveries of oil and mineral deposits.
o	Kenya is one of Africa’s most developed financial and capital markets with cross-listings in Uganda and London.
o	As East Africa’s economic and political hub, Kenya provides a launch pad into the East and Central Africa region with over 450 million people.


 











Private Equity
Private equity (PE) became known as an industry in the United States during the 1980s when PE funds returned an average of 19% IRR (annualized return) to their investors. The industry has been popularized by the venture capital funds of Silicon Valley and multi-billion dollar mega buyout funds like Carlyle, KKR and Blackstone.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, PE has become increasingly popular with pension funds and global asset managers because of its relative stability and growth compared to publicly traded stocks. Top quartile PE funds outperformed U.S. and European stock markets respectively by 19% and 24% in average annual return between 1993 to 2013, according to the Bain & Co. Global PE Report 2014. 













Affiliates 
 
Hawkhill Holdings 
The ultimate holding company of Hawkhill Group is based in the Republic of Mauritius with a Global Business License II. 
 

ABLE 
Since 2012, Hawkhill has supported the African Business Leadership Endowment, a Kenyan NGO dedicated to human resource and leadership development. ABLE serves as the CSR arm of Hawkhill Group.
 

Hawkhill Partners 
In 2013, Hawkhill Partners was registered in the Republic of Kenya as an advisory firm with specialization in strategy consulting and financial advisory services for SMEs. In 2016, financial services were moved to a sister company Hawkhill Capital. Hawkhill Partners is now the services and advisory arm of Hawkhill Group.
