Reformulation and Calorie Reduction - Beverage Industry Leading the Way

                        According to an article in the April edition of FoodBev magazine, the beverage industry is leading the way in terms of reformulating drinks with different sweeteners such as fructose or stevia, to reduce calories and address the obesity epidemic. Dow Water & Process Solutions' Marlin Kinzey highlights the strengths of ion exchange resins in chromatographic processes and how they help separate and enrich different sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids and related compounds.

Northern China's Wastewater Treatment Challenges Inspire Innovation of Reverse Osmosis Elements

                        Coal has fueled China's rapid industrial and economic growth, but with this comes heavy environmental impact, especially on the region's water supply. As the government enacts stricter regulations, industrial plants are forced to implement wastewater recovery and reuse systems, which, in some cases, recycle 100 percent of the water with no discharge.

                        Read More








Wastewater Treatment Gets a New Spin

                        The quest to optimize water re-use and anticipate regulatory pressures is driving many plants to give increasing attention to their wastewater. Experts in Dow Water & Process Solutions spoke to Chemical Processing magazine about new technologies they are introducing to help wastewater treatment specialists meet these challenges.

Ahead of World Water Day, Dow, Richard Childress Racing and University Research Partners Spotlight Importance of Innovation and Collaboration in Arizona

                        Leaders gather in Tucson to discuss water challenges and opportunities at University of Arizona’s WEST Center

Minimal Liquid Discharge: Advanced Membranes for High-Recovery Treatment

                        Industrial water users are finding it more and more challenging to manage water utility due to reduced access to reliable low-cost water sources and higher surcharges for discharging water. Investing in wastewater reuse systems to recover and recycle 70% of the water in an industrial plant has become an acceptable and commonly practiced option for the past 10 to 15 years, but it still leaves 30% of the water unrecovered. 

                        Read More








Reuse: Global Reach, Local Impact

                        In just 14 years, the United Nations estimates the world will only have 60% of the water resources it needs, if we do nothing different. Obvious solutions to water scarcity can include water reuse, wastewater reclamation, and conservation. But, what if we are just hitting the tip of the iceberg with these tactics?

The Long Read: Do we have the technology for potable water reuse?

                        As the market for water reuse grows, how confident are water technologists and engineers that they can produce consistently safe sources of drinking water from wastewater? Very confident, is the industry consensus. Reverse osmosis (RO) systems of the type used in seawater desalination are emerging as the dominant technology for water reuse, and confidence is high that they are robust, although work continues on a handful of challenges in reuse applications.

The State of Industrial Water with Dow Global Business Director Snehal Desai

                        Water is a finite resource with an increasing global demand. To discover what today's leading companies are doing to maintain the world's water supply, Water Technology spoke with key industry leaders, including Dow Water & Process Solutions' Global Business Director, Snehal Desai. Of the many water reuse techniques available, Desai noted that recycled wastewater is an emerging trend worth paying attention to.

Next-Generation, Foul-Resisting RO Membranes

                        Water availability and resources are declining both in volume and quality globally, causing the industrial manufacturers to turn to in-house water treatment systems to purify water sources. However, water treatment can be costly if the appropriate technologies and components are not as effective as possible. Reserve osmosis treatment technology has become the gold standard for industrial water users, especially with the advent of a new generation equipped with advanced foul-resisting technology.

Managing Water in an Increasingly Demanding Power Market

                        Increasing demand, evolving energy sources and environmental drivers are shifting the global power landscape. As a result, the global water landscape must evolve to meet the shift in water treatment of freshwater sourcing to wastewater treatment and reuse for the power generation industry. Reducing energy usage, chemical costs and water footprints, while increasing reclamation of non-conventional water sources, are key industry focal points.

Lowering costs and raising sustainability: wastewater treatment for the Food and Beverage industry

                        Water is critical to the food and beverage processing industries where water and wastewater are key components of multiple operations. Today, companies are held responsible and therefore must better understand and manage their wastewater. This has led to a growing need in the food and beverage industry to implement wastewater treatment solutions that are affordable, reliable and low-maintenance.
