P/CF Ratio
The price to cash flow ratio (P/CF) is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. Each holding&#39;s P/CF is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s cash flow per share. Negative P/CF ratios are excluded from this calculation.

as of 26-Jul-2017



18.26




P/B Ratio
The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Each holding&#39;s P/B is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s book value per share. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation.

as of 26-Jul-2017

Equity Beta
Beta is a measure of the tendency of securities to move with the market as a whole. A beta of 1 indicates that the security&#39;s price will move with the market. A beta less than 1 indicates the security tends to be less volatile than the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates the security is more volatile than the market.<br/><br/>Calculated vs. S&amp;P 500

as of 30-Jun-2017

Standard Deviation (3y)
Standard deviation measures how dispersed returns are around the average. A higher standard deviation indicates that returns are spread out over a larger range of values and thus, more volatile.

as of 30-Jun-2017



15.53%




Distribution Yield
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It’s calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund’s net asset value (NAV) from the as-of date.

as of 30-Jun-2017



3.05%




12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV. The 12-Month yield is calculated by assuming any income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV and any capital gain distributions made over the past twelve months.

as of 30-Jun-2017



3.85%




30 Day SEC Yield
A standard calculation of yield introduced by the SEC in order to provide fairer comparison among funds. This yield reflects the interest earned after deducting the fund&#39;s expenses during the most recent 30-day period by the average investor in the fund.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.


Real estate investment trusts ("REITs") are subject to changes in economic conditions, credit risk and interest rate fluctuations.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 230 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks total return through investment in real estate securities.




Strategy



The fund invests at least 80%, and normally substantially all, of its total assets in common stocks and other equity securities issued by real estate companies. It may invest up to 20% of its total assets in securities of foreign issuers (including emerging market issuers) which meet the same criteria for investment as domestic companies, including investments in such companies in the form of American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs") and European Depositary Receipts ("EDRs"). The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



Real Estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates, economic conditions (both nationally and locally), property tax rates, and other factors. Changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Real Estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates, economic conditions (both nationally and locally), property tax rates, and other factors. Changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Expense Ratio as disclosed in the May 1, 2017 prospectus:
Gross Expense Ratio:1.02%
Net Expense Ratio:1.00%
Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Fund's investment manager (the "Manager"), has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse the Fund total annual so that total annual Fund operating expenses (excluding brokerage fees and commissions, taxes, and, upon approval of the Board, extraordinary expenses) never exceed 1.00% of average daily net assets. Absent such arrangements, returns would have been lower. This commitment is currently expected to remain in place for the life of the Funds, can only be amended or terminated by agreement of the Fund and the Manager and will terminate automatically in the event of termination of the investment management agreement between the Fund and the Manager
Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Periods greater than 12 months are annualized. Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions.
During certain periods presented above, the advisor waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses. Without this arrangement, performance would be lower.
The FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Real Estate Index - net is an unmanaged market-capitalization-weighted total-return index, which consists of publicly traded equity REITs and listed property companies from developed markets and is net of dividend withholding taxes.The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of 500 large-capitalization stocks that is frequently used as a general measure of U.S. stock market performance.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index, and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes.
Because of its concentration in real estate securities, the Fund is subject to special risk considerations described in the Fund's prospectus, which is available on this website .

Estimates Only - Do Not Use for Tax Reporting Purposes
This table provides estimates of the Fund's distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes. A return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. The source of all distributions paid by the Fund, including net investment income, is subject to change. This is because the Fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar companies. Distributions from REITs are attributed to various sources including net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the REIT securities held by the Fund. The Fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year.
Income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from GAAP. As a result, distributions are subject to recharacterization for federal income tax purposes. As the Fund has a capital loss carryover, any distribution paid to shareholders that exceeds the total of the Fund’s investment company taxable income must be characterized as ordinary income, up to the amount of the Fund’s net capital gain realized during the calendar year. This would cause a distribution that is classified as a return of capital under GAAP to be reported as ordinary income for tax purposes.
The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after year-end and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above. Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year, will specify how the distributions paid by the Fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return (e.g. ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain).

Expense Ratio as disclosed in the May 1, 2017 prospectus:
Gross Expense Ratio:1.02%
Net Expense Ratio:1.00%
Cohen & Steers Capital Management,Inc.,the Fund’s investment advisor (the“Advisor”),has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse theFund so that total annual Fund operating expenses (excluding brokerage fees and commissions,taxes,and,upon approval of the Board,extraordinaryexpenses) never exceed 1.00% of average daily net assets.This commitment is currently expected to remain in place for the life of the Fund,can onlybe amended or terminated by agreement of the Fund and the Advisor and will terminate automatically in the event of termination of the investmentmanagement agreement between the Advisor and the Fund.
Portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice. The mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any particular security.  NAV is as of prior night's market close. You can obtain a complete listing of holdings by clicking here .
NAV per share is as of the prior day’s market close of regular trading on the NYSE, generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Risks of Investing in Real Estate Securities
Risks of investing in real estate securities are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate, including falling property values due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic, legal, political or technological developments, lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to certain economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations, lower liquidity, political and economic uncertainties, and differences in accounting standards. Some international securities may represent small- and medium-sized companies, which may be more susceptible to price volatility and less liquidity than larger companies. The Fund is classified as a "non-diversified" fund under the federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund. However, the Fund must meet certain diversification requirements under the U.S. tax laws. No representation or warranty is made as to the efficacy of any particular strategy or fund or the actual returns that may be achieved.
For U.S. residents only.
For funds with at least a 3-year history, a Morningstar Rating (tm) is based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees) with emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variaitons in the distribution percentages.

Class A Expense Ratio as disclosed in the April 1, 2017 prospectus:
Gross Expense Ratio (Class A) 1.31%
Net Expense Ratio (Class A) 1.30%
Through June 30, 2018, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Fund’s investment advisor (the Advisor), has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse expenses so that the Fund’s total annual operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes and extraordinary expenses) do not exceed 1.30% for the Class A shares.
* Maximum 4.5% sales charge; returns for other share classes will differ due to differing expense structures and sales charges.
** Linked benchmark consists of the FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index through 9/30/07 and the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Real Estate Index (net) thereafter. 
Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Periods greater than 12 months are annualized. Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions.
During certain periods presented above, the advisor waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses. Without this arrangement, performance would be lower.
Effective September 28, 2007, the fund changed its investment objective and strategy to invest according to a global real estate mandate. Prior to this date, the fund achieved its investment objective under a domestic real estate mandate. The performance record shown in the table for periods prior to September 28, 2007 was achieved under the fund's previous mandate. 
The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of 500 large-capitalization stocks that is frequently used as a general measure of U.S. stock market performance. The FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Real Estate Index - net is an unmanaged market-capitalization-weighted total-return index, which consists of publicly traded equity REITs and listed property companies from developed markets and is net of dividend withholding taxes. The FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index contains all tax-qualified REITs except timber and infrastructure REITs with more than 50% of total assets in qualifying real estate assets other than mortgages secured by real property that also meet minimum size and liquidity criteria.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index, and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes.
Because of its concentration in real estate securities, the Fund is subject to special risk considerations described in the Fund's prospectus, which is available on this website .

Estimates Only - Do Not Use for Tax Reporting Purposes
This table provides estimates of the Fund's distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes. A return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. The source of all distributions paid by the Fund, including net investment income, is subject to change. This is because the Fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar companies. Distributions from REITs are attributed to various sources including net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the REIT securities held by the Fund. The Fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year.
Income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from GAAP. As a result, distributions are subject to recharacterization for federal income tax purposes. As the Fund has a capital loss carryover, any distribution paid to shareholders that exceeds the total of the Fund’s investment company taxable income must be characterized as ordinary income, up to the amount of the Fund’s net capital gain realized during the calendar year. This would cause a distribution that is classified as a return of capital under GAAP to be reported as ordinary income for tax purposes.
The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after year-end and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above. Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year, will specify how the distributions paid by the Fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return (e.g. ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain).

Important Information
Class A Expense Ratio as disclosed in the April 1, 2017 prospectus:
Gross Expense Ratio (Class A) 1.31%
Net Expense Ratio (Class A) 1.30%
Through June 30, 2018, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Fund’s investment advisor (the Advisor), has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse expenses so that the Fund’s total annual operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes and extraordinary expenses) do not exceed 1.30% for the Class A shares.
Portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice. The mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any particular security.  NAV is as of prior night's market close. You can obtain a complete listing of holdings by clicking here .
NAV per share is as of the prior day’s market close of regular trading on the NYSE, generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Maximum 4.5% sales charge; returns for other share classes will differ due to differing expense structures and sales charges. Class C shares are subject to a maximum CDSC of 1% if shares are redeemed within one year of purchase.
Risks of Investing in Real Estate Securities
Risks of investing in real estate securities are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate, including falling property values due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic, legal, political or technological developments, lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to certain economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations, lower liquidity, political and economic uncertainties, and differences in accounting standards. Some international securities may represent small- and medium-sized companies, which may be more susceptible to price volatility and less liquidity than larger companies. The Fund is classified as a "non-diversified" fund under the federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund. However, the Fund must meet certain diversification requirements under the U.S. tax laws. No representation or warranty is made as to the efficacy of any particular strategy or fund or the actual returns that may be achieved.
For U.S. residents only.
For funds with at least a 3-year history, a Morningstar Rating (tm) is based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees) with emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variaitons in the distribution percentages.

	GLOBAL REALTY SHARES, INC.








	INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE





	The investment objective of Cohen & Steers Institutional Global Realty Shares, Inc. (the Fund) is total return (capital appreciation and current income) through investment in global real estate



	equity securities.







	FUND FEES AND EXPENSES

	(1)




	Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Funds investment advisor (the Advisor) has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse the Fund
	so that its total annual operating expenses never exceed 1.00% of average daily net assets. This commitment will remain in place for the life of the Fund.







	Example





	This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost
	of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return
	each year and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same pursuant to its agreement with the Advisor. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:



	 























	1 Year






	 






	3 Years






	 






	5 Years






	 






	10 Years










	 






	 






	 










	 






	 






	 









	Portfolio Turnover





	The Fund pays transactions costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when
	Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was




	    

	% of the average value of its portfolio.







	PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES





	Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80%, and normally substantially all, of its total assets in a portfolio of equity securities issued
	by U.S. and non-U.S. real estate companies. Real estate equity securities include common stocks, preferred stocks and other equity securities issued by real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar REIT-like
	entities. REITs are companies that own interests in real estate or in real estate related loans or other interests and revenue primarily consists of rent derived from owned, income producing real estate properties and capital gains from the sale of
	such properties. A REIT in the U.S. is generally not taxed on income distributed to shareholders so long as it meets certain tax related requirements, including the requirement that it distribute substantially all of its taxable income to such
	shareholders. REIT-like entities are organized outside of the U.S. and have operations and receive tax treatment similar to that of U.S. REITs. The Fund retains the ability to invest in real estate companies of any market capitalization.




	Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests significantly (at least 40%unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the
	Advisor in which case the Fund invests at least 30%) in real estate companies organized or located outside the U.S. or doing a substantial amount of business outside the U.S. The Fund allocates its assets among various regions and countries,
	including the United States (but in no less than three different countries).




	 




	1












	PRINCIPAL RISKS




	 





	




	 






	Investment Risk

	- An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you
	invest.






	 





	




	 






	Stock Market Risk

	- Your investment in Fund shares represents an indirect investment in the REIT shares and other real estate securities owned
	by the Fund. The value of these equity securities, like other stock market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Your Fund shares at any point in time may be worth less than what you invested, even after taking into
	account the reinvestment of Fund dividends and distributions.






	 





	




	 






	Real Estate Market Risk -

	Since the Fund concentrates its assets in the real estate industry, your investment in the Fund will be closely linked
	to the performance of the real estate markets. Property values may fall due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from unanticipated economic, legal, cultural or technological developments. Real estate company prices also may drop
	because of the failure of borrowers to pay their loans and poor management.






	 





	




	 






	REIT Risk

	- REITs are dependent upon management skills and generally may not be diversified. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow
	dependency, defaults by borrowers and self-liquidation. In addition, REITs could possibly fail to qualify for pass-through of income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Other factors may also adversely affect a
	borrowers or a lessees ability to meet its obligations to the REIT. In the event of a default by a borrower or lessee, the REIT may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may incur substantial costs
	associated with protecting its investments.






	 





	




	 






	Foreign (Non-U.S.) Securities Risk

	- Risks of investing in foreign securities include currency risks, future political and economic developments
	and possible imposition of foreign withholding taxes on income payable on the securities. In addition, there may be less publicly available information about a foreign issuer than about a domestic issuer, and foreign issuers may not be subject to
	the same accounting, auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements as domestic issuers.






	 





	




	 






	Foreign Currency Risk

	- The Funds net asset value (NAV) could decline as a result of changes in the exchange rates between foreign
	currencies and the U.S. dollar. Certain foreign countries may impose restrictions on the ability of issuers of foreign securities to make payment of principal and interest to investors located outside the country, due to blockage of foreign currency
	exchanges or otherwise.






	 





	




	 






	Emerging Markets Risk

	- Securities of companies in emerging markets may be more volatile than those of companies in more developed markets.
	Emerging market countries generally have less developed markets and economies and, in some countries, less mature governments and governmental institutions. Investing in securities of companies in emerging markets may entail special risks relating
	to potential economic, political or social instability and the risks of expropriation, nationalization, confiscation or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investment, the lack of hedging instruments, and on repatriation of capital invested. A
	small number of companies representing a limited number of industries may account for a significant percentage of an emerging market countrys overall market and trading volume. Emerging market economies may be over-dependent on exports,
	especially with respect to primary commodities, making these economies vulnerable to changes in commodity prices. Emerging market countries may have overburdened infrastructure and obsolete or unseasoned financial systems, environmental problems,
	less developed legal systems and less reliable custodial services and settlement practices.






	 





	




	 






	Smaller Companies Risk

	- Even the larger real estate companies in the industry tend to be small- to medium-sized companies in relation to the
	equity markets as a whole. There may be less trading in a smaller companys stock, which means that buy and sell transactions in that stock could have a larger impact on the stocks price than is the case with larger company stocks.
	Smaller companies also may have fewer lines of business so that changes in any one line of business may have a greater impact on a smaller companys stock price than is the case for a larger company. Further, smaller company stocks may perform
	in different cycles than larger company stocks. Accordingly, real estate company shares can be more volatile thanand at times will perform differently fromlarge company stocks such as those found in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

	Interest Rate Risk

	- Interest rate risk is the risk that preferred securities, and to a lesser extent dividend-paying common stocks, will
	decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. When market interest rates rise, the market value of such securities generally will fall.






	 





	




	 






	Non-Diversification

	- As a non-diversified investment company, the Fund can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified
	investment company. Because a non-diversified portfolio is more likely to experience large market price fluctuations, the Fund may be subject to a greater risk of loss than a fund that has a diversified portfolio.








	Your investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other



	government agency.








	FUND PERFORMANCE





	The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows changes in the Funds performance from year to year. The table shows how the
	Funds average annual returns compare with the performance of selected broad market indexes over various time periods. Past performance (both before and after taxes) is not, however, an indication as to how the Fund may perform in the future.
	Updated performance is available at

	cohenandsteers.com

	or by calling (800) 330-7348.




	This chart does not reflect the deduction of
	taxes on distributions or redemptions; if these amounts were reflected, returns would be less than those shown.

	INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, PRINCIPAL
	INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RELATED RISKS





	 


	 








	OBJECTIVE





	The investment
	objective of the Fund is total return through investment in global real estate equity securities. The Fund pursues its investment objective of total return by seeking capital appreciation and current income. There can be no assurance that the Fund
	will achieve its investment objective. Shareholders will be provided with at least 60 days prior written notice of any change to the Funds investment objective. The Fund may change its investment objective without shareholder approval,
	although it has no current intention to do so. The Fund, of course, will concentrate its investments in the real estate industry.




	 


	 








	PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES





	In managing the Funds portfolio, the Advisor and Cohen & Steers Asia Limited (CNS Asia), Cohen & Steers UK Limited
	(CNS UK) and Cohen & Steers Europe S.A. (CNS Europe), the Funds sub-investment advisors (the Subadvisors), adhere to an integrated, bottom-up, relative value investment process. A proprietary valuation model ranks global real estate
	securities on price-to-NAV, which the Advisor and Subadvisors believe is the primary determinant of real estate security valuation, and guides a bottom-up portfolio construction process. Analysts incorporate both quantitative and qualitative
	analysis in their NAV estimates. The company research process includes an evaluation of management, strategy, property quality, financial strength and corporate structure. In addition to the NAV model, portfolio managers may use secondary valuation
	tools including cash flow multiple/growth or discounted cash flow models. Judgments with respect to risk control, diversification, liquidity and other factors overlay the models output and drive the portfolio managers investment
	decisions.




	The following are the Funds principal investment strategies. A more detailed description of the Funds investment
	policies and restrictions and more detailed information about the Funds investments are contained in the Funds statement of additional information (SAI).





	Real Estate Companies





	For purposes of the Funds investment policies, a

	real
	estate company

	is one that:



	 





	




	 





	derives at least 50% of its revenues from the ownership, construction, financing, management or sale of commercial, industrial or residential real
	estate







	or



	 





	




	 





	has at least 50% of its assets in such real estate







	 




	6






	 


	 



	Under normal market conditions, the Fund will
	invest significantly (at least 40%unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the Advisor, in which case the Fund would invest at least 30%) in real estate companies (including REIT and REIT-like entities) organized or located outside
	the U.S. or doing a substantial amount of business outside the U.S. The Fund will allocate its assets among various regions and countries, including the United States (but in no less than three different countries). The Fund considers a company that
	derives at least 50% of its revenue from business outside the U.S. or has at least 50% of its assets outside the U.S. as doing a substantial amount of business outside the U.S. For temporary defensive purposes, the Fund may invest as described below
	under Additional Investment InformationDefensive Position. The Fund is not limited in the extent to which it may invest in real estate equity securities of companies domiciled in emerging market countries.




	The

	equity securities

	in which the Fund invests can consist of:



	 





	




	 





	common stocks;






	 





	




	 





	rights or warrants to purchase common stocks;






	 





	




	 





	securities convertible into common stocks where the conversion feature represents, in the view of the Advisor or a Subadvisor, a significant element of
	the securities value; and






	 





	




	 





	preferred stocks.








	Real
	Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)





	REITs are companies that own interests in real estate or in real estate related loans or other interests
	and revenue primarily consists of rent derived from owned, income producing real estate properties and capital gains from the sale of such properties. A REIT is generally not taxed on income distributed to shareholders so long as it meets certain
	tax related requirements, including the requirement that it distribute substantially all of its taxable income to such shareholders (other than net capital gain) for each taxable year. As a result, REITs tend to pay relatively higher dividends than
	other types of companies.




	REITs can generally be classified as equity REITs, mortgage REITs and hybrid REITs. Equity REITs, which invest the
	majority of their assets directly in real property, derive their income primarily from rents. Equity REITs can also realize capital gains by selling properties that have appreciated in value. Mortgage REITs, which invest the majority of their assets
	in real estate mortgages, derive their income primarily from interest payments. Hybrid REITs combine the characteristics of both equity REITs and mortgage REITs. The Fund invests primarily in equity REITs.





	Foreign (Non-U.S.) Real Estate Securities





	The Fund invests in non-U.S. real estate companies. These companies may have characteristics that are similar to a REIT. A REIT is a type of U.S. real estate company that is dedicated to owning and usually operating income producing real
	estate or to financing real estate. REITs are not subject to U.S. corporate income tax provided they comply with a number of tax requirements, including the annual distribution to shareholders of at least 90% of their net income. A number of
	countries around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting, similar REIT-like structures pursuant to which these companies are not subject to corporate income tax in their home countries provided they distribute a significant percentage of
	their net income each year to shareholders and meet certain other requirements. The Fund may invest a significant percentage of its portfolio in foreign-domiciled REIT-like entities. However, the Fund may also invest a significant percentage of its
	portfolio in other real estate companies.




	 




	7






	 


	 




	Depositary Receipts





	The Fund may also invest in securities of foreign companies in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) and
	European Depositary Receipts (EDRs). Generally, ADRs in registered form are dollar denominated securities designed for use in the U.S. securities markets, which represent and may be converted into an underlying foreign security. GDRs, in bearer
	form, are designated for use outside the United States. EDRs, in bearer form, are designed for use in the European securities markets.



	 


	 






	ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT INFORMATION





	In addition to the principal investment strategies described above, the Fund has other investment practices that are described here and in
	the SAI.





	Illiquid Securities





	The Fund will not invest more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities. A security is illiquid if, for legal or market reasons, it cannot be promptly sold (

	i.e.,

	within seven days) at a price which approximates its fair
	value.





	Other Investments





	The Fund may engage in foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency forward contracts, options, swaps and other similar strategic transactions in connection with its investments in securities of non-U.S. companies.





	Defensive Position





	When the Advisor
	believes that market or general economic conditions justify a temporary defensive position, the Fund may deviate from its investment objective and invest all or any portion of its assets in short-term debt instruments, government securities, cash or
	cash equivalents. When and to the extent the Fund assumes a temporary defensive position, it may not pursue or achieve its investment objective.





	Portfolio Holdings





	A description of the Funds policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the Funds
	portfolio securities is available in the Funds SAI. The Fund also files its complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form N-Q as of the end of its first and third fiscal quarters. The
	Funds full portfolio holdings are published semi-annually in reports sent to shareholders and filed with the SEC on Form N-CSR and such reports are made available at cohenandsteers.com in the Our Funds section, generally
	within 70 days after the end of




	 




	8






	 


	 



	each semi-annual period. The Fund also posts an
	uncertified list of portfolio holdings on the Web site, no earlier than 15 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The holdings information remains available until the Fund files a report on Form N-Q or Form N-CSR for the period that
	includes the date as of which the information is current. In addition to information on portfolio holdings, other Fund statistical information may be found on the Cohen & Steers Funds Web site or by calling 800-330-7348.




	 


	 








	PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND





	In addition to the risks
	previously discussed in the Summary Section, the following are also risks of investing in the Fund.




	Because prices of equity securities
	fluctuate from day to day, the value of the Funds portfolio and the price per share will vary based upon general market conditions and the value of the securities held in the Funds portfolio.





	General Risks of Securities Linked to the Real Estate Market





	The Fund will not invest in real estate directly, but only in securities issued by real estate companies. However, because of its policy of concentration in the securities of companies in the real estate
	industry, the Fund is also subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate. These risks include:



	 





	




	 





	declines in the value of real estate;






	 





	




	 





	risks related to general and local economic conditions;






	 





	




	 





	possible lack of availability of mortgage funds;






	 





	




	 





	overbuilding;






	 





	




	 





	extended vacancies of properties;






	 





	




	 





	increased competition;






	 





	




	 





	increases in property taxes and operating expenses;






	 





	




	 





	changes in zoning laws;






	 





	




	 





	losses due to costs resulting from the clean-up of environmental problems;






	 





	




	 





	liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental problems;






	 





	




	 





	casualty or condemnation losses;






	 





	




	 





	limitations on rents;






	 





	




	 





	changes in neighborhood values and the appeal of properties to tenants; and






	 





	




	 





	changes in interest rates.







	Thus, the value of the Funds shares may change at different rates compared to the value of shares of a mutual fund with investments in a mix of different industries.








	Risks of Investing in REITs





	In addition to risks of securities linked to the real estate
	industry, equity REITs may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts, while mortgage REITs may be affected by the quality of any credit extended. Further, REITs are dependent upon management skills and
	generally may not be diversified. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency, defaults by borrowers and self-liquidation. In addition, REITs could possibly fail to qualify for pass-through of income under the Code, or to




	 




	9






	 


	 



	maintain their exemptions from registration under
	the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act). The above factors may also adversely affect a borrowers or a lessees ability to meet its obligations to the REIT. In the event of a default by a borrower or lessee, the REIT may
	experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its investments.





	General Risks of Foreign (Non-U.S.) Securities





	The Fund may without limit in foreign (non-U.S.) securities. Under normal
	market conditions, the Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its total assets in non-U.S. real estate equity securities. Investing in these foreign securities involves certain risks not involved in domestic investments, including, but not limited
	to:



	 





	




	 





	future foreign economic, financial, political and social developments;






	 





	




	 





	different legal systems;






	 





	




	 





	the possible imposition of exchange controls or other foreign governmental laws or restrictions;






	 





	




	 





	less governmental supervision;






	 





	




	 





	regulation changes;






	 





	




	 





	changes in currency exchange rates;






	 





	




	 





	less publicly available information about companies due to less rigorous disclosure or accounting standards or regulatory practices;






	 





	




	 





	high and volatile rates of inflation;






	 





	




	 





	fluctuating interest rates;






	 





	




	 





	different accounting, auditing and financial record-keeping standards and requirements; and






	 





	




	 





	dividend income the Fund receives from these foreign securities may not be eligible for the special tax treatment applicable to qualified income.







	Investments in foreign securities, especially in emerging market countries, will expose the Fund to the direct or indirect
	consequences of political, social or economic changes in the countries that issue the securities or in which the issuers are located. Certain countries in which the Fund may invest, especially emerging market countries, have historically
	experienced, and may continue to experience, high rates of inflation, high interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations, large amounts of external debt, balance of payments and trade difficulties and extreme poverty and unemployment. Many of these
	countries are also characterized by political uncertainty and instability. The cost of servicing external debt will generally be adversely affected by rising international interest rates because many external debt obligations bear interest at rates
	that are adjusted based upon international interest rates. In addition, with respect to certain foreign countries, there is a risk of:



	 





	




	 





	the possibility of expropriation of assets;






	 





	




	 





	confiscatory taxation;






	 





	




	 





	difficulty in obtaining or enforcing a court judgment;






	 





	




	 





	economic, political or social instability; and






	 





	




	 





	diplomatic developments that could affect investments in those countries.







	 




	10






	 


	 



	In addition, individual foreign economies may
	differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as:



	 





	




	 





	growth of gross domestic product;






	 





	




	 





	rates of inflation;






	 





	




	 





	capital reinvestment;






	 





	




	 





	resources;






	 





	




	 





	self-sufficiency; and






	 





	




	 





	balance of payments position.







	To the extent the Funds investments are concentrated in a geographic region or country, the Fund will be subject, to a greater extent than if the Funds assets were less concentrated, to the risks of adverse changes in that
	region or country.





	Emerging Markets Risk





	The Fund is not limited in the extent to which it may invest in securities of companies domiciled in so-called emerging markets (or lesser developed countries), and investments in such
	securities are particularly speculative.




	Emerging securities markets are substantially smaller, less developed, less liquid and more volatile
	than the major securities markets. The limited size of emerging securities markets and limited trading value compared to the volume of trading in U.S. securities could cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the quality
	of the securities. For example, limited market size may cause prices to be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions. Adverse publicity and investors perceptions, whether or not based on fundamental analysis, may decrease the
	value and liquidity of portfolio securities, especially in these markets. Many emerging market countries have experienced substantial, and in some periods extremely high, rates of inflation for many years. Inflation and rapid fluctuations in
	inflation rates and corresponding currency devaluations have had and may continue to have negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries.




	As a result of these potential risks, the Advisor or a Subadvisor may determine that, notwithstanding otherwise favorable investment criteria, it may not be practicable or appropriate to invest in a
	particular country. The Fund may invest in countries in which foreign investors, including the Advisor or a Subadvisor, have had no or limited prior experience.





	Foreign Currency Risk and Currency Hedging Risk





	Although the Fund will report its NAV and
	pay dividends in U.S. dollars, foreign securities often are purchased with and make interest payments in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the Fund invests in foreign securities, it will be subject to foreign currency risk, which means that the
	Funds NAV could decline as a result of changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. Certain foreign countries may impose restrictions on the ability of issuers of foreign securities to make payment of principal
	and interest to investors located outside the country, due to blockage of foreign currency exchanges or otherwise.

	The Fund may engage in various investments that are
	designed to hedge the Funds foreign currency risks. While these transactions will be entered into to seek to manage these risks, these investments may not prove to be successful or may have the effect of limiting the gains from favorable
	market movements.

	THE ADVISOR AND SUBADVISORS





	The Advisor, a registered investment advisor, located at 280 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017 was formed in 1986 and its current clients
	include pension plans, endowment funds and investment companies, including each of the open-end and closed-end Cohen & Steers funds. As of March 31, 2010, the Advisor managed approximately
	$

	            

	 billion in assets. The Advisor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cohen & Steers, Inc. (CNS), a publicly traded company whose common stock is listed on the
	New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol CNS.




	The Advisor is responsible for the overall management of the Funds
	portfolio and for the supervision and ongoing monitoring of the Subadvisors.




	CNS Asia, with offices located at 12/F Citibank Tower, Citibank
	Plaza, No. 3 Garden Road, Central Hong Kong, is a wholly owned subsidiary of CNS and serves as a Subadvisor pursuant to an agreement with the Advisor (the Subadvisory Agreement). CNS Asia provides investment research and advisory services with
	respect to Asia Pacific real estate securities and provides trade order execution services for the Fund. CNS Asia was formed in 2005.




	CNS
	Europe, with offices located at 166 Chausee de la Hulpe, Brussels, Belgium, is a wholly owned subsidiary of CNS and serves as a Subadvisor pursuant to Subadvisory Agreement. CNS Europe provides investment advisory and research services to the
	Advisor in connection with managing the Funds investments in Europe. CNS Europe was formed in February 2000.

	of its investment advisory fee received from the Fund.




	References in this Prospectus to activities and responsibilities of the Advisor may be
	performed by one or more of the Subadvisors.




	Under its investment management agreement (the Investment Management Agreement) with the Fund,
	the Advisor furnishes a continuous investment program for the Funds portfolio, makes the day-to-day investment decisions for the Fund, and generally manages the Funds investments in accordance with the stated policies of the Fund,
	subject to the general supervision of the Board of Directors of the Fund. The Advisor also performs certain administrative services for the Fund, and provides persons satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the Fund to serve as officers of the
	Fund.




	 




	12






	 


	 



	Such officers, as well as certain other employees
	and Directors of the Fund, may also be directors, officers, or employees of the Advisor. The Advisor and Subadvisors also select brokers and dealers to execute the Funds portfolio transactions.




	For its services under the Investment Management Agreement, the Fund pays the Advisor a monthly investment management fee at the annual rate of 1.00% of the
	average daily NAV of the Fund. The Advisor pays all expenses of the Fund except for brokerage fees, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of the independent directors (including fees and expenses of their independent counsel and other independent
	consultants), trade organization membership dues, federal and state registration fees and extraordinary expenses. Certain broker-dealers and financial intermediaries may charge the Advisor fees for administrative services that such dealers provide
	to Fund shareholders, which the Advisor will pay from its own resources. The Advisor (not the Fund) pays the Subadvisors out of its management fees from the Fund.




	A discussion regarding the Board of Directors basis for approving the Investment Management Agreement and sub-advisory agreements is available in the Funds annual report to shareholders for
	the year ended December 31, 2009.

	HOW TO PURCHASE AND SELL FUND
	SHARES





	 


	 








	PRICING OF FUND SHARES





	The price at which you can purchase and redeem the
	Funds shares is the NAV of the shares next determined after we receive your order in proper form. Proper form means that your request includes the Fund name and account number, states the amount of the transaction (in dollars or shares),
	includes the signatures of all owners exactly as registered on the account, signature guarantees (if necessary), any supporting legal documentation that may be required and any outstanding certificates representing shares to be redeemed.




	We calculate our NAV per share as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, generally 4:00 p.m. eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for
	trading. Thus, purchase and redemption orders must be received in proper form by the close of regular trading on the NYSE in order to receive that days NAV; orders received after the close of regular trading on the NYSE will receive the NAV
	next determined. The Fund has authorized one or more brokers to accept on its behalf purchase (and redemption) orders, and these brokers are authorized to designate other intermediaries on the Funds behalf. The Fund will be deemed to have
	received a purchase (or redemption) order when an authorized broker, or that brokers designee, accepts the order, and that order will be priced at the next computed NAV after this acceptance. We determine NAV per share by adding the market
	value of all securities and other assets in the Funds portfolio, subtracting the Funds liabilities, and dividing by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund.




	Investments in securities that are listed on the NYSE are valued, except as indicated below, at the last sale price reflected at the close of the NYSE on the business day as of which such value is being
	determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices for the day or, if no asked price is available, at the bid price.




	Securities not listed on the NYSE but listed on other domestic or foreign securities exchanges are valued in a similar manner. Securities traded on more
	than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of which such value is being determined as reflected on the tape at the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such securities. If after the
	close of a foreign market, but prior to the close of business on the day the securities are being valued, market conditions change significantly, certain foreign securities may be fair valued pursuant to procedures established by the Board of
	Directors.




	Readily marketable securities traded in the over-the-counter market, including listed securities whose primary market is believed
	by the Advisor to be over-the-counter are valued at the official closing prices as reported by sources as the Board of Directors deem appropriate to reflect their fair market value. If there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at
	the mean of the closing bid and asked prices for the day, or if no asked price is available, at the bid price. However, certain fixed-income securities may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service when such prices are believed
	by the Board of Directors to reflect the fair market value of such securities.




	 




	14






	 


	 



	Securities for which market prices are unavailable,
	or securities for which the Advisor determines that bid and/or asked price does not reflect market value, will be valued at fair value pursuant to procedures approved by the Funds Board of Directors. Circumstances in which market prices may be
	unavailable include, but are not limited to, when trading in a security is suspended, the exchange on which the security is traded is subject to an unscheduled close or disruption or material events occur after the close of the exchange on which the
	security is principally traded. In these circumstances, the Fund determines fair value in a manner that fairly reflects the market value of the security on the valuation date based on consideration of any information or factors it deems appropriate.
	These may include recent transactions in comparable securities, information relating to the specific security and developments in the markets.




	The Funds use of fair value pricing may cause the NAV of Fund shares to differ from the NAV that would be calculated using market quotations. Fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value
	determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of that security.




	Short-term debt
	securities, which have a maturity date of 60 days or less, are valued at amortized cost, which approximates value.




	Because the Fund may hold
	securities that are primarily listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities held in the Fund may change on days when you will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund
	shares.





	The Fund reserves the right to reject or cancel any purchase order and to withdraw or suspend the offering of shares at any time.
	The Fund may also request additional information from you in order to verify your identity. If you do not provide this information or if such information cannot be verified, we reserve the right to close your account to the extent required or
	permitted by applicable law or regulations, including those relating to the prevention of money laundering.

	FORM OF PAYMENT





	We will accept payment for shares in three forms:




	1. A check drawn on any bank or domestic savings institution. Checks must be payable in U.S. dollars and will be accepted subject to collection at full face value.




	2. A bank wire or Federal Reserve Wire of federal funds.




	3. At the Funds discretion,
	marketable securities having a value that meets the investment minimum.

	An exchange of shares may result in your
	realizing a taxable gain or loss for income tax purposes. See Additional InformationTax Considerations. The exchange privilege is available to shareholders residing in any state in which the shares being acquired may be legally sold. Before
	you exercise the exchange privilege, you should read the prospectus of the fund whose shares you are acquiring. Certain dealers and other financial intermediaries may limit or prohibit your right to use the exchange privilege and may charge you a
	fee for exchange transactions placed through them.




	We have adopted reasonable procedures that are designed to ensure that any telephonic
	exchange instructions are genuine. Neither the Fund nor its agents will be liable for any loss or expenses if we act in accordance with these procedures.

	HOW TO SELL FUND SHARES





	You may sell or redeem your shares through authorized dealers, other financial intermediaries or through the Transfer Agent. If your
	shares are held by your dealer or intermediary in street name, you must redeem your shares through that dealer or intermediary.





	Redemptions Through Dealers and Intermediaries





	If you have an account with an authorized dealer or other intermediary, you may
	submit a redemption request to such dealer or intermediary. They are responsible for promptly transmitting redemption requests to the Distributor. Dealers and intermediaries may impose charges for handling redemption transactions placed through them
	that are in addition to any other charges described in this Prospectus. Such charges may include processing or service fees, which are typically fixed dollar amounts. You should contact your dealer or intermediary for more information about
	additional charges that may apply.





	Redemption By Telephone





	To redeem shares by telephone, call the Funds Transfer Agent at (800) 437-9912. In order to be honored at that days price, we must receive any telephone redemption requests by the close
	of regular trading of the NYSE, generally 4:00 p.m., eastern time. Orders received after the close of regular trading on the NYSE will receive the NAV next determined.




	If you would like to change your telephone redemption instructions, you must send the Transfer Agent written notification signed by all of the accounts registered owners, accompanied by signature
	guarantee(s), as described below.




	We may modify or suspend telephone redemption and exchange privileges without notice during periods of
	drastic economic or market changes. We have adopted reasonable procedures that are designed to ensure that any telephonic redemption instructions are genuine. Neither the Fund nor its agents will be liable for any loss or expenses if we act in
	accordance with these procedures.

	We may modify or terminate the telephone redemption privilege at any time on 30 days notice to shareholders.






	Redemption By Mail





	You can redeem Fund shares by sending a written request for redemption
	to the Transfer Agent:




	    Boston Financial Data Services




	    P.O. Box 8123




	    Boston, Massachusetts 02266-8123




	    Attn: Cohen & Steers Institutional Global Realty Shares, Inc.




	A written redemption request must:



	 





	




	 





	state the number of shares or dollar amount to be redeemed;






	 





	




	 





	identify your account number and tax identification number; and






	 





	




	 





	be signed by each registered owner exactly as the shares are registered.







	If the shares to be redeemed were issued in certificate form, the certificate must be endorsed for transfer (or be accompanied by a duly executed stock
	power) and must be submitted to the Transfer Agent together with a redemption request.




	For redemptions made by corporations, executors,
	administrators or guardians, the Transfer Agent may require additional supporting documents evidencing the authority of the person making the redemption (including evidence of appointment or incumbency). For additional information regarding the
	specific documentation required, contact the Transfer Agent at (800)437-9912.




	 




	19






	 


	 



	The Transfer Agent will not consider your
	redemption request to be properly made until it receives all required documentation in proper form.



	 


	 






	OTHER REDEMPTION INFORMATION






	Payment of Redemption Proceeds.

	The Fund will send you redemption proceeds by check. However, if you made an election on the
	Subscription Agreement to receive redemption proceeds by wire, the Fund will send the proceeds by wire to your designated bank account. When proceeds of a redemption are to be paid to someone other than the shareholder, either by wire or check, you
	must send a letter of instruction and the signature(s) on the letter of instruction must be guaranteed, as described below, regardless of the amount of the redemption. The Transfer Agent will normally mail checks for redemption proceeds within five
	business days. Redemptions by wire will normally be sent within two business days. The Fund will delay the payment of redemption proceeds, however, if your check used to pay for the shares to be redeemed has not cleared, which may take up to 15 days
	or more. The Fund may suspend the right of redemption or postpone the date of payment if trading is halted or restricted on the NYSE or under other emergency conditions as permitted by the 1940 Act.




	The Fund will pay redemption proceeds in cash, by check or wire, unless the Board of Directors believes that economic conditions exist which make redeeming
	in cash detrimental to the best interests of the Fund (subject to the election described below). In the event that this were to occur, all or a portion of your redemption proceeds would consist of readily marketable portfolio securities of the Fund
	transferred into your name. You would then incur brokerage costs in converting the securities to cash. The Fund has elected, however, to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the 1940 Act, as a result of which the Fund is obligated to redeem shares, with
	respect to any one shareholder during any 90-day period, solely in cash up to the lesser of $250,000 or 1% of the Fund's NAV at the beginning of the period.





	Signature Guarantee.

	You may need to have your signature guaranteed (STAMP 2000 Medallion) in certain situations, such as:



	 





	




	 





	written requests to wire redemption proceeds (if not previously authorized on the Subscription Agreement);






	 





	




	 





	sending redemption proceeds to any person, address or bank account not on record; and






	 





	




	 





	transferring redemption proceeds to a Cohen & Steers fund account with a different registration (name/ownership) from yours.







	You can obtain a signature guarantee from most banks, savings institutions, broker-dealers and other guarantors acceptable
	to the Fund. The Fund cannot accept guarantees from notaries public or organizations that do not provide reimbursement in the case of fraud. A Signature Validation Program (SVP) stamp may be accepted for certain non-financial shareholder
	account changes. Please see the SAI for additional information.





	Redemption of Small Accounts





	If your Fund account has a value of $100,000 or less as the result of any voluntary redemption, we may redeem your remaining shares. We will, however, give
	you 30 days notice of our intention to do so. During this 30-day notice period, you may make additional investments to increase your account value to $3,000,000 (the minimum purchase amount) or more and avoid having the Fund automatically
	liquidate your account.




	 


	 








	FREQUENT PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF FUND SHARES





	The Fund is designed for long-term investors with investment horizons of at least two months. Excessive trading, short-term market timing or other abusive trading practices may disrupt portfolio
	management strategies and harm portfolio performance. For example, in order to handle large flows of




	 




	20






	 


	 



	cash into and out of a fund, a portfolio manager
	may need to allocate more assets to cash or other short-term investments or sell securities. Transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions and market spreads, can detract from the Funds performance. Additionally, market timing is a concern
	for the Fund because the Funds portfolio will have foreign securities and therefore could be subject to time-zone arbitrage.




	Because of
	potential harm to the Fund and its long-term investors, the Board of Directors of the Fund has adopted policies and procedures to discourage and prevent excessive trading and short-term market timing. As part of these policies and procedures, the
	Advisor monitors purchase, exchange and redemption activity in Fund shares. The intent is not to inhibit legitimate strategies such as asset allocation, dollar cost averaging or similar activities that may nonetheless result in frequent trading of
	the Funds shares. Therefore, there are no specific restrictions on the volume or number of purchases, exchanges or redemptions of Fund shares a shareholder may make, although the Fund reserves the right to reject or refuse any purchase request
	(including those that are part of exchange activity) that could adversely affect the Fund or its operations. If, based on these procedures, the advisor believes that a shareholder is engaged in, or has engaged in, market timing or excessive trading,
	we may place a temporary or permanent block on all further purchases or exchanges of Fund shares.




	The following transactions are excluded
	when determining whether trading activity is excessive: (i) transfers associated with systematic purchases or redemptions; (ii) transactions through firm-sponsored, discretionary asset allocation or wrap programs and
	(iii) transactions subject to the trading policy of an intermediary that the Fund deems materially similar to the Funds policy.




	Multiple accounts under common ownership or control may be considered one account for the purpose of determining a pattern of excessive trading, short-term market timing or other abusive trading practices.




	The Fund will also utilize fair value pricing in an effort to reduce arbitrage opportunities available to short-term traders.




	Due to the complexity and subjectivity involved in identifying excessive trading and market timing activity, there can be no guarantee that the Fund will be
	able to identify and restrict such activity in all cases. Additionally, it is more difficult for the Fund to monitor the trading activity of beneficial owners of the Fund shares who hold those shares through third-party 401(k) and other group
	retirement plans and other omnibus arrangements maintained by broker/dealers and other intermediaries. Omnibus account arrangements permit multiple investors to aggregate their respective share ownership positions and purchase, redeem and exchange
	Fund shares in a single account.




	In certain circumstances the Fund may accept frequent trading restrictions of intermediaries that differ
	from the Funds policies. Since such intermediaries execute or administer transactions with many fund families, it may be impractical for them to enforce a particular funds frequent trading or exchange policy. These alternate trading
	restrictions would be authorized only if the Fund believes that the alternate restrictions would provide reasonable protection to the Fund and its shareholders.




	 


	 








	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION




	 


	 






	NETWORKING AND SUB-TRANSFER AGENCY FEES





	The Fund may also enter into
	agreements with financial intermediaries pursuant to which the Fund will pay financial intermediaries for services such as networking or sub-transfer agency. Payments made pursuant to such agreements are generally based on either
	(1) a percentage of the average daily net assets of Fund shareholders serviced by such financial intermediaries, or (2) the number of Fund shareholders serviced by such financial intermediaries. From time to time, the Advisor may pay a
	portion of the fees for networking or sub-transfer agency services at its own expense and out of its own profits.



	 


	 






	OTHER COMPENSATION





	The Advisor and the Distributor may make payments from their own resources to dealers and other financial intermediaries for distribution,
	administrative or other services. For further information, please consult the SAI.

	DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS





	The Fund intends to declare and pay dividends from its investment income semi-annually. The Fund intends to distribute net realized capital
	gains, if any, at least once each year, normally in December. The Transfer Agent will automatically reinvest your dividends and distributions in additional shares of the Fund unless you elect to have them paid to you in cash.



	 


	 






	TAX CONSIDERATIONS





	The following tax discussion assumes you are a U.S. shareholder. This discussion
	offers only a brief outline of the federal income tax consequences of investing in the Fund and is based on the federal tax laws in effect on the date hereof. Such tax laws are subject to change by legislative, judicial or administrative action,
	possibly with retroactive effect. In the SAI we have provided more detailed information regarding the tax consequences of investing in the Fund.




	Dividends paid to you out of the Funds investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the Code, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, will be taxable to you as ordinary dividend
	income. If a portion of the Funds income consists of dividends paid by U.S. corporations (other than REITs), a portion of the dividends paid by the Fund may be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction (DRD). In addition, for
	taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2010, distributions of investment company taxable income designated by the Fund as derived from qualified dividend income (QDI) will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable
	to long-term capital gain, provided holding period and other requirements are met by both you and the Fund. Dividend income that the Fund receives from REITs will generally not be treated as QDI. There can be no assurance that favorable tax
	treatment of QDI will continue following December 31, 2010. A foreign corporation is a qualified foreign corporation if it is (1) incorporated in a possession of the United States or is eligible for benefits of a comprehensive
	income tax treaty with the United States that the United States Treasury Department determines is satisfactory for this purpose and that includes an exchange of information program or (2) any other foreign corporation with respect to any
	dividend paid by such corporation if the stock with respect to which such dividend is paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. A qualified foreign corporation does not include any foreign
	corporation, which for the taxable year of the corporation in which the dividend was paid, or the preceding taxable year, is a passive foreign investment company. Because of the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, the Fund cannot predict at this
	time what portion, if any, of the dividends it will receive from foreign corporations will be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation applicable to QDI. Distributions of net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net
	short-term capital loss), if any, designated as capital gain dividends are taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held your Fund shares. A distribution of an amount in




	 




	22






	 


	 



	excess of the Funds current and accumulated
	earnings and profits is treated as a non-taxable return of capital that reduces your tax basis in your Fund shares; any such distributions in excess of your tax basis are treated as gain from a sale of your shares. The tax treatment of your
	dividends and distributions will be the same regardless of whether they were paid to you in cash or reinvested in additional Fund shares. If you buy shares of the Fund when the Fund has realized but not yet distributed income or capital gains, you
	will be buying a dividend by paying the full price for the shares and then receiving a portion back in the form of a taxable distribution.




	A distribution will be treated as paid to you on December 31 of the current calendar year if it is declared by the Fund in October, November or December with a record date in such a month and paid during January of the following year.




	Each year, we will notify you of the tax status of dividends and other distributions.




	If you sell or redeem your Fund shares, or exchange them for shares of another Cohen & Steers open-end fund, you may realize a capital gain or loss
	(provided the shares are held as a capital asset) which will be long-term or short-term, depending on your holding period for the shares.




	We
	may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax from all taxable distributions and redemption proceeds payable if you:



	 





	




	 





	fail to provide us with your correct taxpayer identification number;






	 





	




	 





	fail to make required certifications; or






	 





	




	 





	have been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you are subject to backup withholding.







	Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld may be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability.




	Certain dividends and other distributions received from sources outside the United States may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by other countries. In
	the event that more than 50% of the value of the total assets of the Fund at the close of the taxable year consists of stock or securities of foreign corporations, the Fund may make an election to pass through to its shareholders the amount of
	foreign taxes paid by it.




	The Fund has elected to be treated as, and intends to qualify each year as, a regulated investment company under
	U.S. federal income tax law. If the Fund so qualifies and distributes each year to its shareholders at least 90% of the sum of its investment company taxable income (as that term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deductions for
	dividends paid) and net tax-exempt interest, the Fund will not be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on any income it distributes to shareholders. Additionally, if the Fund distributes less than an amount equal to the sum of 98% of its
	ordinary income for the calendar year and 98% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending on October 31, unless the fund elects to use a calendar year, plus any ordinary income and capital gain net income from previous years
	that was not distributed, then the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the undistributed amounts. The Fund intends to make sufficient distributions of its income to satisfy the distribution requirement and prevent application of
	the excise tax. If in any taxable year the Fund fails to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Code, the Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible by the
	Fund in computing its taxable income.




	Fund distributions also may be subject to state and local taxes. You should consult with your own tax
	advisor regarding the particular consequences of investing in the Fund.




	A non-resident alien individual, a foreign trust or estate, foreign
	corporation or foreign partnership (foreign shareholders) are advised to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.

	FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS




	 


	 



	The financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the financial performance of the Fund, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and the fiscal period from
	August 10, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Certain information reflects financial results for a single Fund share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned on an investment in the Fund (assuming
	reinvestment of all dividends and distributions). These financial highlights have been derived from financial statements audited by

	                    

	, whose report, along with the Funds audited financial statements, is included in the Funds current annual
	report, which is available free of charge upon request.




	The following table includes selected data for a share outstanding throughout each
	period and other performance information derived from the financial statements. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto.

	INVESTMENT POLICIES






	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING FUND INVESTMENTS





	The following descriptions supplement the information set forth in the Prospectuses relating to each Funds investments and risks. Except as otherwise
	provided in the Prospectus or as disclosed below, each Funds investment objective, strategies and investment policies are not fundamental and may be changed by the Board of Directors of a Fund without the approval of the shareholders; however,
	a Fund will not change its investment objective or policies without written notice to shareholders. In addition, shareholders will be provided with at least 60 days prior written notice of any change to a Funds 80% investment
	policy as described in that Funds Prospectus (e.g., Realty Income Funds policy of investing at least 80% of its total assets in income-producing common stocks and other equity securities issued by real estate companies, such as real
	estate investment trusts ).





	REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS





	Each Fund may invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs are sometimes informally characterized as equity REITs, mortgage REITs and hybrid REITs. An equity REIT invests primarily
	in the fee ownership or leasehold ownership of land and buildings and derives its income primarily from rental income. An equity REIT may also realize capital gains (or losses) by selling real estate properties in its portfolio that have appreciated
	(or depreciated) in value. A mortgage REIT invests primarily in mortgages on real estate, which may secure construction, development or long-term loans. A mortgage REIT generally derives its income primarily from interest payments on the credit it
	has extended. A hybrid REIT combines the characteristics of equity REITs and mortgage REITs, generally by holding both ownership interests and mortgage interests in real estate. It is anticipated, although not required, that under normal
	circumstances a majority of a Funds investments in REITs will consist of securities issued by equity REITs.

	CASH RESERVES





	The cash reserves for each of Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund and Realty Income Fund, in each case held to provide sufficient flexibility to take advantage of
	new opportunities for investments and for other cash needs, will be invested in money market instruments and generally will not exceed 15% of total assets. If Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. (the Advisor) has difficulty
	finding an adequate number of undervalued equity securities, all or any portion of a Funds assets may also be invested temporarily in money market instruments. Cash reserves in excess of 20% of total assets will be maintained for defensive
	purposes only.




	Money market instruments in which a Fund may invest its cash reserves will generally consist of obligations issued or
	guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities and such obligations which are subject to repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which an investor, such as the Fund, purchases a U.S. Government
	security from a counterparty, with an agreement by the counterparty to repurchase the security at the same price, plus interest at a specified rate. In such a case, the security is held by the Fund, in effect as collateral for the repurchase
	obligation.




	Repurchase agreements may be entered into with member banks of the Federal Reserve System or primary dealers (as
	designated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) in U.S. Government securities. Other acceptable money market instruments include commercial paper rated by any nationally recognized rating agency, such as Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
	(Moodys) or Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P), certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances issued by domestic banks having total assets in excess of one billion dollars, and money market
	mutual Funds.




	In entering into any repurchase agreement for the Fund, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Funds
	investment advisor (the Advisor) will evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparty. In the event that a counterparty should default on its repurchase obligation, the Fund might suffer a loss to the extent that the proceeds from the
	sale of the collateral were less than the repurchase price. If the counterparty becomes bankrupt, the Fund might be delayed, or may incur costs or possible losses of principal or income, in selling the collateral.





	SECURITIES LENDING





	Each Fund may lend
	portfolio securities to broker/dealers or other institutions. The borrower must maintain with a Fund cash or equivalent collateral equal to at least 100% of the market value of the securities loaned. During the time portfolio securities are on loan,
	the borrower pays the lending Fund any dividends or interest paid on the securities. A Fund may invest the collateral and earn additional income or receive an agreed upon amount of interest income from the borrower. Loans are subject to termination
	at the option of a Fund or the borrower. A Fund may pay reasonable administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan. A Fund does not have the right to vote securities on loan, but would terminate the loan and regain the right to vote if
	that were considered important with respect to the investment. A Fund may lose money if a borrower defaults on its obligation to return securities and the value of the collateral held by that Fund is insufficient to replace the loaned securities. In
	addition, a Fund is responsible for any loss that might result from its investment of the borrowers collateral.





	ILLIQUID SECURITIES





	A Fund will not invest in illiquid securities if immediately after such investment more than 15% of that Funds net assets (taken at
	market value) would be invested in such securities. For this purpose, illiquid securities include, among others, securities that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale.
	Securities that have legal or contractual restrictions on resale but have a readily available market are not deemed illiquid for purposes of this limitation.




	Historically, illiquid securities have included securities subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale because they have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
	Securities Act), and securities which are otherwise not readily marketable. Securities which have not been registered under the Securities Act are referred to as private placements or restricted securities and are purchased directly from
	the issuer or in the secondary market. The Funds do not typically hold a significant amount of these restricted or other illiquid securities because of the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation. Limitations on resale may have
	an adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securities, and a Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid securities promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within
	seven days. A Fund might also have to register such restricted securities in order to dispose of them, resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of securities.




	In recent years, however, a large institutional market has developed for certain securities that are not registered under the Securities Act, including
	repurchase agreements, commercial paper, foreign securities, municipal securities and corporate bonds and notes. Institutional investors depend on an efficient institutional market in which the unregistered security can be readily resold or on an
	issuers ability to honor a demand for repayment. The fact that there are contractual or legal restrictions on resale to the general public or to certain institutions may not be indicative of the liquidity of such investments.




	Rule 144A under the Securities Act allows a broader institutional trading market for securities otherwise subject to restriction on resale to the general
	public. Rule 144A establishes a safe harbor from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of resales of certain securities to qualified institutional buyers, which generally creates a more liquid market for securities eligible for resale
	under Rule 144A than other types of restricted securities.




	The Advisor will monitor the liquidity of restricted securities in a Funds
	portfolio, under the supervision of the Board of Directors. In reaching liquidity decisions, the Advisor will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the frequency of trades and quotes for the security;




	 




	4







	(2) the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential
	purchasers; (3) dealer undertakings to make a market in the security; and (4) the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades (e.g., the time needed to dispose of the security, the method of soliciting offers and the
	mechanics of the transfer).





	CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES





	Global Infrastructure Fund may invest in convertible securities. Convertible securities are preferred stocks or debt obligations that are convertible into common stock. They generally offer lower interest
	or dividend yields than non-convertible securities of similar quality. Convertible securities have both equity and fixed-income risk characteristics. Like all fixed-income securities, the value of convertible securities is susceptible to the risk of
	market losses attributable to changes in interest rates. Generally, the market value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline. However, when the market price of the
	common stock underlying a convertible security approaches or exceeds the conversion price of the convertible security, the convertible security tends to reflect the market price of the underlying common stock. As the market price of the underlying
	common stock declines, the convertible security, like a fixed-income security, tends to trade increasingly on a yield basis, and thus, may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stock. The markets for convertible securities
	may be less liquid than markets for common stocks or bonds.





	DEBT SECURITIES





	Global Infrastructure Fund may invest in debt securities, such as bonds, debentures, government obligations, commercial paper and pass-through instruments.
	The value of debt securities may fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and the issuers financial condition. When interest rates rise or the issuers financial condition worsens or is perceived by the market to be at greater risk,
	the value of debt securities tends to decline.





	MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS





	Global Infrastructure Fund may invest in equity securities of master limited partnerships (MLPs), and their affiliates. An MLP generally has two classes of
	partners, the general partner and the limited partners. The general partner normally controls the MLP through an equity interest plus units that are subordinated to the common (publicly traded) units for an initial period and then only converting to
	common if certain financial tests are met. As a motivation for the general partner to successfully manage the MLP and increase cash flows, the terms of most MLPs typically provide that the general partner receives a larger portion of the net income
	as distributions reach higher target levels. As cash flow grows, the general partner receives a greater interest in the incremental income compared to the interest of limited partners. The general partners incentive compensation typically
	increases to up to 50% of incremental income. Nevertheless, the aggregate amount distributed to limited partners will increase as MLP distributions reach higher target levels. Given this incentive structure, the general partner has an incentive to
	streamline operations and undertake acquisitions and growth projects in order to increase distributions to all partners.




	MLP common units
	represent an equity ownership interest in a partnership, providing limited voting rights and entitling the holder to a share of the companys success through distributions and/or capital appreciation. Unlike shareholders of a corporation,
	common unit holders do not elect directors annually and generally have the right to vote only on certain significant events, such as mergers, a sale of substantially all of the assets, removal of the general partner or material amendments to the
	partnership agreement. MLPs are required by their partnership agreements to distribute a large percentage of their current operating earnings. Common unit holders generally have first right to a minimum quarterly distribution prior to distributions
	to the convertible subordinated unit holders or the general partner (including incentive distributions). Common unit holders typically have arrearage rights if the minimum quarterly distribution is not met. In the event of liquidation, MLP common
	unit holders have first right to the partnerships remaining assets after bondholders, other debt holders, and preferred unit holders have been paid in full. MLP common units trade on a national securities exchange or over-the-counter. Some
	limited liability companies (LLCs) may be treated as MLPs for federal income tax purposes. Similar to MLPs, LLCs typically do not pay federal income tax at the entity level and are required by their operating agreements to distribute a large
	percentage of their current operating earnings. In contrast to MLPs, LLCs have no general partner and there are no incentives that entitle management or other unit holders to increased percentages of cash distributions as distributions reach higher
	target levels. In addition, LLC common unit holders typically have voting rights with respect to the LLC, whereas MLP common units have limited voting rights. MLP common units and other equity securities can be affected by macro economic and other
	factors affecting the stock market in general, expectations of interest rates, investor sentiment towards MLPs or a MLPs business sector, changes in a particular issuers financial condition, or unfavorable or unanticipated poor
	performance of a particular issuer (in the case of MLPs, generally measured in terms of distributable cash flow). Prices of common units of individual MLPs and other equity securities can also be affected by fundamentals unique to the partnership or
	company, including earnings power and coverage ratios.




	MLP convertible subordinated units are typically issued by MLPs to founders, corporate
	general partners of MLPs, entities that sell assets to the MLP, and institutional investors, and may be purchased in direct placements from such persons. The purpose of the convertible subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that during the
	subordination period there will be available cash to be distributed to common unit holders. Convertible subordinated units generally are not entitled to distributions until holders of common units have received specified minimum quarterly
	distributions, plus any arrearages, and may receive less in distributions upon liquidation. Convertible subordinated unit holders generally are entitled to a minimum quarterly distribution prior to the payment of incentive distributions to the
	general partner, but are not entitled to arrearage rights. Therefore, they generally entail greater risk than MLP common units. They are generally convertible automatically into the senior common units of the same issuer at a one-to-one ratio upon
	the passage of time or the satisfaction of certain financial tests. These units do not trade on a national exchange or over-the-counter, and there is no active market for convertible subordinated units. The value of a convertible security is a
	function of its worth if converted into the underlying common units. Convertible subordinated units generally have similar voting rights to MLP common units. Because convertible subordinated units generally convert to common units on a one-to-one
	ratio, the price that the Fund could be expected to pay upon purchase or to realize upon resale is generally tied to the common unit price less a discount. The size of the discount varies depending on a variety of factors including the likelihood of
	conversion, and the length of time remaining to conversion, and the size of the block purchased.




	 




	5







	MLP I-Shares represent an indirect investment in MLP I-units. I-units are equity securities issued to
	affiliates of MLPs, typically a limited liability company, that own an interest in and manage the MLP. The issuer has management rights but is not entitled to incentive distributions. The I-Share issuers assets consist exclusively of MLP
	I-units. Distributions by MLPs to I-unit holders are made in the form of additional I-units, generally equal in amount to the cash received by common unit holders of MLPs. Distributions to I-Share holders are made in the form of additional I-Shares,
	generally equal in amount to the I-units received by the I-Share issuer. The issuer of the I-Share is taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes; however, the MLP does not allocate income or loss to the I-Share issuer. Accordingly,
	investors receive a Form 1099, are not allocated their proportionate share of income of the MLPs and are not subject to state income tax filing obligations. The price of I-Shares and their volatility tend to be correlated to the price of common
	units, although the price correlation is not precise.





	CANADIAN ROYALTY TRUSTS





	Global Infrastructure Fund may invest in Canadian royalty trusts. A Canadian royalty trust is a trust whose securities are listed on a Canadian stock
	exchange and which controls an underlying company whose business is the acquisition, exploitation, production and sale of oil and natural gas. These trusts generally pay out to unitholders the majority of the cash flow that they receive from the
	production and sale of underlying oil and natural gas reserves. The amount of distributions paid on a Canadian royalty trusts units will vary from time to time based on production levels, commodity prices, royalty rates and certain expenses,
	deductions and costs, as well as on the distribution payout ratio policy adopted. As a result of distributing the bulk of their cash flow to unitholders, the ability of a Canadian royalty trust to finance internal growth through exploration is
	limited. Therefore, Canadian royalty trusts typically grow through acquisition of additional oil and gas properties or producing companies with proven reserves of oil and gas, funded through the issuance of additional equity or, where the trust is
	able, additional debt.





	FOREIGN (NON-U.S.) SECURITIES





	Realty Shares, Institutional Realty Shares and Realty Income Fund may each invest up to 20% of their total assets in securities of foreign issuers which meet the same criteria for investment as domestic
	companies, or sponsored and unsponsored depositary receipts for such securities.




	Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares,
	Institutional Global Realty Shares and International Realty Fund may invest without limit in equity securities of foreign (non-U.S.) real estate companies, or sponsored and unsponsored depositary receipts for such securities.




	A Fund may be subject to additional investment risks for foreign securities that are different in some respects than those incurred by investments in
	securities of domestic issuers. Such risks include currency risks, future political and economic developments, the possible imposition of foreign withholding taxes on income payable on the securities, the possible establishment of exchange controls,
	the possible seizure or nationalization of foreign deposits, or the adoption of other foreign governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payments on such securities. There can be no assurance that such laws will not become applicable
	to certain of a Funds investments. In addition, there may be less publicly available information about a foreign issuer than about a domestic issuer; brokerage commissions, custodial services and other costs relating to investment in foreign
	securities markets generally are more expensive than in the U.S.; foreign securities markets may have substantially less volume than U.S. securities markets, making many foreign issuers less liquid and more volatile than securities of
	comparable domestic issuers; and foreign issuers may not be subject to the same accounting, auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements as domestic issuers. Dividend income a Fund receives from foreign securities may not be
	eligible for the special tax treatment reserved for qualified dividend income. See Taxation.




	Each Fund may invest in sponsored
	and unsponsored American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) and similar depositary receipts. ADRs, typically issued by a financial institution (a depositary), evidence ownership interests in a security or a pool of
	securities issued by a foreign company and deposited with the depositary. Prices of ADRs are quoted in U.S. dollars, and ADRs are traded in the United States. GDRs are receipts issued outside the United States, typically by non-United States banks
	and trust companies, that evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic securities. Generally, GDRs, in bearer form, are designated for use outside the United States. Ownership of ADRs and GDRs entails similar investment risks to direct ownership
	of foreign securities traded outside the U.S., including increased market liquidity, currency, political, information and other risks.





	PREFERRED STOCK, WARRANTS AND RIGHTS





	Each Fund may invest in preferred stock, warrants and rights. Preferred stocks are
	securities that represent an ownership interest providing the holder with claims on the issuers earnings and assets before common shareholders, but after bond holders and other creditors. Unlike debt securities, the obligations of an issuer of
	preferred stock, including dividend and other payment obligations, may not typically be accelerated by the holders of such preferred stock on the occurrence of an event of default or other non-compliance by the issuer of the preferred stock.
	Investments in preferred stock present market and liquidity risks. The value of a preferred stock may be highly sensitive to the economic condition of the issuer, and markets for preferred stock may be less liquid than the market for the
	issuers common stock.




	Warrants are options to buy a stated number of shares of common stock at a specified price at any time during the
	life of the warrant. Rights represent a privilege offered to holders of record of issued securities to subscribe (usually on a pro rata basis) for additional securities of the same class, of a different class or of a different issuer. The holders of
	warrants and rights have no voting rights, receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the issuer. The value of a warrant or right may not necessarily change with the value of the underlying securities. Warrants and rights
	cease to have value if they are not exercised prior to their expiration date. Investments in warrants and rights are thus speculative and may result in a total loss of any money invested in their acquisition.

	PREFERRED SECURITIES





	In addition to preferred stock, Global Infrastructure Fund may also invest in hybrid preferred securities issued by utility companies and other types of companies. Hybrid-preferred securities are usually
	issued by a trust or limited partnership and often represent preferred interests in subordinated debt instruments issued by a corporation for whose benefit the trust or partnership was established. Preferred securities pay fixed or floating
	dividends to investors and have preference over common stock in the payment of dividends and the liquidation of a companys assets. This means that a company must pay dividends on preferred stock before paying dividends on its
	common stock. Preferred shareholders usually have no right to vote for corporate directors or on other matters.




	The hybrid preferred
	securities in which Global Infrastructure Fund intends to invest do not qualify for the dividends received deduction (DRD) under Section 243 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and are not expected to provide
	significant benefits under the rules relating to qualified dividend income. The DRD generally allows corporations to deduct from their income 70% of dividends received. Pursuant to recently enacted legislation, individuals will generally be taxed at
	long-term capital gain rates on qualified dividend income. Distributions received from the Fund attributable to traditional preferred securities would qualify for the DRD as to any corporate shareholder and would qualify to be taxed at long-term
	capital gains rates as to any individual shareholder. However, any corporate shareholder who otherwise would qualify for the DRD, and any individual shareholder who otherwise would qualify to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates on qualified
	dividend income, should assume that none of the distributions the shareholder receives from the Fund attributable to hybrid-preferred securities will qualify for the DRD or provide significant benefits under the rules relating to qualified dividend
	income. Distributions received from the Fund attributable to traditional preferred securities, such as the preferred securities of utility companies, generally would qualify to be taxed at long-term capital gains rates as to any individual
	shareholder.





	REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS





	Institutional Global Realty Shares, Institutional Realty Shares and Realty Shares may enter into repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which an investor, such as a Fund, purchases a U.S. Government security
	from a vendor, with an agreement by the vendor to repurchase the security at the same price, plus interest at a specified rate. In such a case, the security is held by that Fund, in effect, as collateral for the repurchase obligation. Repurchase
	agreements may be entered into with member banks of the Federal Reserve System or primary dealers (as designated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) in U.S. Government securities. Repurchase agreements usually have a short duration,
	often less than one week. In entering into the repurchase agreement for a Fund, the Advisor will evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of the vendor. In the event that a vendor should default on its repurchase obligation, a Fund might suffer a
	loss to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of the collateral were less than the repurchase price. If the vendor becomes bankrupt, a Fund might be delayed, or may incur costs or possible losses of principal and income, in selling the
	collateral.





	BORROWING FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES





	Global Realty Shares may borrow up to 30% of the value of its total assets to increase its holdings of portfolio securities. The Fund is required to maintain continuous asset coverage of 300% with respect
	to such borrowings and to sell (within three days) sufficient portfolio holdings to restore such coverage if it should decline to less than 300% due to market fluctuations or otherwise, even if such liquidations of the Funds portfolio are
	disadvantageous from an investment standpoint. Leveraging by means of borrowing, which is deemed to be a speculative technique, may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the portfolio securities or the Funds net
	asset value (NAV). Money borrowed also will be subject to interest and other costs (which may include commitment fees and/or the cost of maintaining minimum average balances) which may or may not exceed the income received from the
	securities purchased with borrowed funds.





	FUTURES CONTRACTS





	Each Fund may purchase and sell financial futures contracts and options on such contracts. A financial futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific security or financial instrument at a
	particular price on a stipulated future date. Although some financial futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying securities or instruments, in most cases these obligations are closed out before the settlement date. The
	closing of a contractual obligation may be accomplished by purchasing or selling an identical offsetting futures contract. Other financial futures contracts by their terms call for cash settlements.




	Each Fund may also buy and sell index futures contracts with respect to any stock or bond index traded on a recognized stock exchange or board of trade. An
	index futures contract is a contract to buy or sell units of an index on a specified future date at a price agreed upon when the contract is made. The stock index futures contract specifies that no delivery of the actual stocks making up the index
	will take place. Instead, settlement in cash must occur upon the termination of the contract, with the settlement being the difference between the contract price and the actual level of the stock index at the expiration of the contract. In addition,
	a Fund may enter into foreign currency futures contracts as described below under Foreign Currency Contracts and Currency Hedging Transactions.

	At the time a Fund purchases a futures contract, an amount of cash or liquid portfolio securities generally
	equal to the settlement price less any margin deposit market value of the futures contract will be designated as segregated at that Funds custodian. When writing a futures contract, a Fund will maintain with its custodian similar liquid assets
	that, when added to the amounts deposited with a futures commission merchant or broker as margin, are equal to the market value of the instruments underlying the contract. Alternatively, a Fund may cover its position by owning the
	instruments underlying the contract (or, in the case of an index futures contract, a portfolio with a volatility substantially similar to that of the index on which the futures contract is based), or holding a call option permitting a Fund to
	purchase the same futures contract at a price no higher than the price of the contract written by a Fund (or at a higher price if the difference is maintained in liquid assets with the Funds custodian).




	Each Fund will be authorized to use financial futures contracts and related options for hedging and non-hedging purposes, for example to enhance total
	return or provide market exposure pending the investment of cash balances. A Fund may lose the expected benefit of the transactions if currency exchange rates or securities prices change in an unanticipated manner. Such unanticipated changes in
	currency exchange rates or securities prices may also result in poorer overall performance than if a Fund had not entered into any futures transactions.








	OPTIONS ON SECURITIES AND STOCK INDEXES





	Each Fund may write covered call and put options
	and purchase call and put options on securities or stock indices that are traded on U.S. exchanges.




	An option on a security is a contract
	that gives the purchaser of the option, in return for the premium paid, the right to buy a specified security (in the case of a call option) or to sell a specified security (in the case of a put option) from or to the writer of the option at a
	designated price during the term of the option. An option on a securities index gives the purchaser of the option, in return for the premium paid, the right to receive from the seller cash equal to the difference between the closing price of the
	index and the exercise price of the option.




	A Fund may write a call or put option only if the option is covered. A call option on
	a security written by a Fund is covered if that Fund owns the underlying security covered by the call or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration (or for additional cash consideration held in
	a segregated account by its custodian) upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in its portfolio. A call option on a security is also covered if a Fund owns a call option on the same security and in the same principal amount as the call
	option written where the exercise price of the call option held (a) is equal to or less than the exercise price of the call option written or (b) is greater than the exercise price of the call option written if the difference is maintained
	by that Fund in cash or liquid portfolio securities in a segregated account with its custodian. A put option on a security written by a Fund is covered if that Fund maintains similar liquid assets with a value equal to the exercise price
	designated as segregated at its custodian, or else owns a put option on the same security and in the same principal amount as the put option written where the exercise price of the put option held is equal to or greater than the exercise price of
	the put option written. The value of the underlying securities on which options may be written at any one time will not exceed 25% of the total assets of the Fund. A Fund will not purchase put or call options if the aggregate premium paid for such
	options would exceed 5% of its total assets at the time of purchase.




	A Fund will cover call options on stock indices by owning securities
	whose price changes, in the opinion of the Advisor, are expected to be similar to those of the index, or in such other manner as may be in accordance with the rules of the exchange on which the option is traded and applicable laws and regulations.
	Nevertheless, where a Fund covers a call option on a stock index through ownership of securities, such securities may not match the composition of the index. In that event, that Fund will not be fully covered and could be subject to risk of loss in
	the event of adverse changes in the value of the index. A Fund will cover put options on stock indices by segregating assets equal to the options exercise price, or in such other manner as may be in accordance with the rules of the exchange on
	which the option is traded and applicable laws and regulations.




	A Fund will receive a premium for writing a put or call option, which will
	increase the Funds gross income in the event the option expires unexercised or is closed out at a profit. If the value of a security or an index on which a Fund has written a call option falls or remains the same, that Fund will realize a
	profit in the form of the premium received (less transaction costs) that could offset all or a portion of any decline in the value of the portfolio securities being hedged. A rise in the value of the underlying security or index, however, exposes
	that Fund to possible loss or loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the value of the underlying index or security. By writing a put option, a Fund assumes the risk of a decline in the underlying security or index. To the extent that the
	price changes of the portfolio securities being hedged correlate with changes in the value of the underlying security or index, writing covered put options on securities or indices will increase a Funds losses in the event of a market decline,
	although such losses will be offset in part by the premium received for writing the option.




	A Fund may also purchase put options to
	hedge its investments against a decline in value. By purchasing a put option, a Fund will seek to offset a decline in the value of the portfolio securities being hedged through appreciation of the put option. If the value of a Funds
	investments does not decline as anticipated, that Funds loss will be limited to the premium paid for the option plus related transaction costs. The success of this strategy will depend, in part, on the accuracy of the correlation between the
	changes in value of the underlying security or index and the changes in value of that Funds security holdings being hedged.




	A Fund may
	purchase call options on individual securities to hedge against an increase in the price of securities that the Fund anticipates purchasing in the future. Similarly, a Fund may purchase call options to attempt to reduce the risk of missing a broad
	market advance, or an advance in an industry or market segment, at a time when that Fund holds uninvested cash or short-term debt securities awaiting investment. When purchasing call options, a Fund will bear the risk of losing all or a portion of
	the premium paid if the value of the underlying security or index does not rise.




	There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist
	when a Fund seeks to close out an option position. Trading could be interrupted, for example, because of supply and demand imbalances arising from a lack of either buyers or sellers, or the options exchange could suspend trading after the price has
	risen or fallen more than the maximum specified by the exchange. Although a Fund may be able to offset to some extent any adverse effects of being unable to liquidate an option position, that Fund may experience losses in some cases as a result of
	such inability.

	FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND CURRENCY HEDGING TRANSACTIONS





	In order to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks, each Fund may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts (forward
	contracts) and foreign currency futures contracts (foreign currency futures), as well as purchase put or call options on foreign currencies, as described below. Each Fund may also conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions
	on a spot (i.e., cash) basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market.




	A Fund may enter into forward contracts to
	attempt to minimize the risk to that Fund from adverse changes in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. A forward contract is an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency for an agreed price on a future date which
	is individually negotiated and privately traded by currency traders and their customers. A Fund may enter into a forward contract, for example, when it enters into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a foreign currency
	or expects to receive a dividend or interest payment on a portfolio holding, in order to lock in the U.S. dollar value of the security or payment. In addition, for example, when a Fund believes that a foreign currency may experience
	a substantial movement against another currency, it may enter into a forward contract to sell an amount of the former foreign currency (or another currency which acts as a proxy for that currency) approximating the value of some or all of that
	Funds portfolio securities denominated in such foreign currency. This second investment practice is generally referred to as cross-hedging. Because in connection with a Funds foreign currency forward transactions an amount of
	that Funds assets equal to the amount of that Funds current commitment under the forward contract will be segregated to be used to pay for the commitment, the Fund will always have cash or other liquid assets available that are
	sufficient to cover any commitments under these contracts or to limit any potential risk. The segregated assets will be marked-to-market on a daily basis. In addition, a Fund will not enter into such forward contracts if, as a result, that Fund will
	have more than 15% of the value of its total assets committed to such contracts. To the extent such contracts would be deemed to be illiquid, they will be included in the maximum limitation of 15% of net assets invested in restricted or illiquid
	securities. Forward contracts may limit potential gain from a positive change in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. Unanticipated changes in currency prices may result in poorer overall performance for a Fund than if it
	had not engaged in such contracts.




	A Fund may enter into exchange-traded foreign currency futures for the purchase or sale for future
	delivery of foreign currencies. U.S. exchange-traded futures are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This investment technique will be used only to hedge against anticipated future changes in exchange rates which otherwise
	might adversely affect the value of a Funds portfolio securities or adversely affect the prices of securities that a Fund intends to purchase at a later date.




	A Fund may purchase and write put and call options on foreign currencies for the purpose of protecting against declines in the dollar value of foreign portfolio securities and against increases in the
	U.S. dollar cost of foreign securities to be acquired. As is the case with other kinds of options, however, the writing of an option on foreign currency will constitute only a partial hedge, up to the amount of the premium received, and that Fund
	could be required to purchase or sell foreign currencies at disadvantageous exchange rates, thereby incurring losses. The purchase of an option on foreign currency may constitute an effective hedge against fluctuation in exchange rates although, in
	the event of rate movements adverse to that Funds position, the Fund may forfeit the entire amount of the premium plus related transaction costs.




	The successful use of forward contracts and foreign currency futures will usually depend on the Advisors ability to forecast currency exchange rate movements correctly. Should exchange rates move in
	an unexpected manner, a Fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits of forward contracts, foreign currency futures or may realize losses.





	RISKS OF OPTIONS, FUTURES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS





	Options, futures and forward contracts are forms of derivatives. The use of
	options, futures and forward contracts as hedging techniques may not succeed where the price movements of the securities underlying the options, futures and forward contracts do not follow the price movements of the portfolio securities subject to
	the hedge. Gains on investments in options, futures and forward contracts depend on the Advisors ability to predict correctly the direction of stock prices, interest rates, currencies and other economic factors and unanticipated changes may
	cause poorer overall performance for a Fund than if it had not engaged in such transactions. Where a liquid secondary market for options, futures or forward contracts does not exist, a Fund may not be able to close its position and, in such an event
	would be unable to control its losses. The loss from investing in certain options, futures and forward contracts is potentially unlimited. The use of forward foreign currency contracts may limit gains from a positive change in the relationship
	between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies.




	A Funds futures transactions will ordinarily be entered into for traditional
	hedging purposes. There is, however, no limit on the amount of a Funds assets that can be put at risk through the use of futures contracts and the value of a Funds futures contracts and options thereon may equal or exceed 100% of that
	Funds total assets.




	Each Fund has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the
	Commodity Exchange Act and, therefore, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the Act.







	SHORT SALES





	Global Infrastructure Fund,
	Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund and Realty Income Fund may enter into short sales, provided the dollar amount of short sales at any one time would not exceed 25% of the net assets of the Fund, and the value of securities of any one
	issuer in which the Fund is short would not exceed the lesser of 2% of the value of the Funds net assets or 2% of the securities of any class of any issuer. A Fund must designate collateral consisting of cash or liquid portfolio securities
	with a value equal to the current market value of the shorted securities, which is marked-to-market daily. If a Fund owns an equal amount of such securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, without payment of any further
	consideration, securities of the same issuer as, and equal in amount to, the securities sold short (which sales are commonly referred to as short sales against the box), the above requirements are not applicable.

	DISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS





	Each Fund has adopted policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the Funds portfolio holdings and ongoing arrangements to make available such information to the general public and to
	certain persons on a selective basis. Except as noted below, a Fund does not provide portfolio holdings to any third party until they are made available on the Cohen & Steers website at cohenandsteers.com or through some other means of
	public dissemination. Each Funds full portfolio holdings are published semi-annually in reports sent to shareholders and such reports are made available on the Cohen & Steers website, within 60 days after the end of each semi-annual
	period. These semi-annual holdings are also filed with the SEC within 70 days of the end of each semi-annual period, as part of Form N-CSR. Quarterly holdings reports are filed with the SEC within 60 days at the end of the first and third quarters,
	as part of Form N-Q. In addition, each Fund posts an uncertified list of portfolio holdings on the website, no earlier than 15 days after the end of each calendar quarter. One day after the full holdings have been published, employees of the
	Advisor may freely distribute them to third parties. This information remains available until a Fund files a report on Form N-Q or Form N-CSR for the period that includes the date as of which the information is current. In addition to information on
	portfolio holdings, other Fund statistical information may be found on the Cohen & Steers Funds website or by calling 800-330-7348.




	The following are exceptions to the general rule that holdings are not disclosed to third parties until posted to the website:




	1.
	Each Funds portfolio holdings may be disclosed prior to public release to certain third parties (e.g., rating and ranking organizations, financial printers, pricing information vendors and research firms) for legitimate business purposes.
	Disclosure is conditioned on receipt of a written confidentiality agreement, including a duty not to trade on the basis of the information disclosed. The portfolio holdings may be disclosed to such third parties on an as-needed basis and such
	disclosure must be authorized by an officer of the Fund. Under these circumstances, the Funds portfolio holdings may be disclosed to the following third parties: Broadridge, Inc., Charles River Systems, Inc., RR Donnelley Financial,
	Merrill Corporation, Interactive Data Corporation, Princeton Financial Systems, Inc., RiskMetrics Group, Moodys and S&P.




	2.
	Each Funds portfolio holdings may also be disclosed between and among each Funds Advisor, subadvisors (if applicable), Distributor, administrator, sub-administrator, custodian, independent registered public accounting firm and outside
	legal counsel for legitimate business purposes within the scope of their official duties and responsibilities, subject to their continuing duty of confidentiality and duty not to trade on the basis of any material nonpublic information, as such
	duties are imposed under the Code of Ethics and the Inside Information Policies and Procedures applicable to the Advisor, Distributor and administrator, and as imposed on the other parties by agreement or under applicable laws, rules and
	regulations.




	3. Each Funds Advisor, subadvisors (if applicable), administrator, sub-administrator or custodian may, for legitimate
	business purposes within the scope of their official duties and responsibilities, disclose portfolio holdings to one or more broker-dealers during the course of, or in connection with, normal day-to-day securities transactions with such
	broker-dealers, subject to the broker-dealers legal obligation not to use or disclose material nonpublic information concerning a Funds portfolio holdings.




	4. Each Fund may provide certain information (other than complete portfolio holdings) related to its portfolio holdings or derived from its portfolio holdings to the media so long as the Funds chief
	compliance officer, or his or her designated representative, determines that a Fund has a legitimate business purpose for disclosing the information and the dissemination cannot be reasonably seen to give the recipient of such information an
	advantage in trading Fund shares or in any other way harm a Fund or its shareholders. Such information may include a small number of portfolio holdings (including information that a Fund no longer holds a particular security) or general information
	about a Funds portfolio holdings that cannot be used to determine a Funds portfolio holdings or any portion thereof. Information about a security may not be released if it could reasonably be seen to interfere with the current or future
	purchase or sale activities of a Fund or is contrary to applicable law.




	5. Fund portfolio holdings may also be disclosed to any person as
	required by applicable laws, rules and regulations. Examples of such required disclosure include, but are not limited to, disclosure (1) in a filing or submission with the SEC or another regulatory body, (2) in connection with a lawsuit or
	(3) as required by court order.




	Each Fund may from time to time post portfolio holdings on the Cohen & Steers website on a
	more timely basis than 15 days after calendar quarter-end if warranted by market conditions or other circumstances.







	INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS





	The investment objective and the general investment policies and investment
	techniques of each Fund are described in each Funds Prospectus. Each Fund has also adopted certain investment restrictions limiting certain activities, except as specifically authorized.





	FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES





	The following
	restrictions have been adopted as fundamental policies by the Funds, as specified below. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), a fundamental policy may not be changed without the vote of a majority of the outstanding
	voting securities of a Fund, as defined under the 1940 Act, to mean the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the shares present at a meeting of shareholders of a Fund, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of that Fund are present
	or represented by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of a Fund.

	Invest in illiquid securities if immediately after such investment more than 15% of the Funds net assets (taken at market value) would be invested in such
	securities;





	 





	 




	2.




	Purchase a security if, as a result (unless the security is acquired pursuant to a plan of reorganization or an offer of exchange), the Fund would own any securities of

	box), and unless not more than 10% of the Funds net assets (taken at market value) is held as collateral for such sales at any one time;

	12








	NON-FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES





	The following investment restrictions have been adopted as non-fundamental policies by the Funds (other than Realty Shares), as specified below. They may be changed at any time by vote of a majority of
	the Board of Directors of an applicable Fund. Realty Shares has not adopted any non-fundamental policies.






	Illiquid
	Securities







	For each Fund (other than Realty Shares)

	: the Fund may not purchase restricted or illiquid securities,
	including repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven days, if as a result, more than 15% of the Funds net assets would then be invested in such securities (excluding securities which are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under
	the Securities Act and determined to be liquid).






	Other Investment Companies







	For each Fund (other than Realty Shares)

	: the Fund may not acquire or retain securities of any investment company, except that the Fund may
	(a) acquire securities of investment companies up to the limits permitted by Section 12(d)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), and (b) acquire securities of any investment company as part
	of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction.






	Short Sales







	For each Fund (other than Realty Shares)

	: the Fund may not make short sales whereby the dollar amount of short sales at any one
	time would exceed 25% of the net assets of the Fund. The Fund must maintain collateral in a segregated account consisting of cash or liquid portfolio securities with a value equal to the current market value of the shorted securities, which is
	marked to market daily. If the Fund owns an equal amount of such securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, without payment of any further consideration, securities of the same issuer as, and equal in amount to, the securities
	sold short (which sales are commonly referred to as short sales against the box), such restrictions shall not apply.








	Options







	For each Fund (other than Realty Shares)

	: the Fund may not invest in puts, calls, straddles, spreads or any combination thereof, except that the Fund may (a) purchase put and call options on securities and securities indexes,
	and (b) write covered put and call options on securities and securities indexes, provided that (i) the securities underlying such options are within the investment policies of the Fund; (ii) at the time of such investment, the value
	of the aggregate premiums paid for such securities does not exceed 5% of the Funds total assets; and (iii) the value of the underlying securities on which options may be written at any one time does not exceed 25% of total assets.




	 




	13









	Oil, Gas and Minerals







	For each Fund (other than Institutional Realty Shares, Institutional Global Realty Shares and Realty Shares)

	: The Fund may not invest in oil, gas or
	other mineral exploration programs, development programs or leases, except that the Fund may purchase securities of companies engaging in whole or in part in such activities.






	Pledging, Mortgaging or Hypothecation of Assets







	For each Fund (other than Realty Shares)

	: the Fund may not pledge, mortgage or hypothecate its assets except in connection with
	permitted borrowings.






	Purchasing Securities on Margin







	For each Fund (other than Realty Shares)

	: The Fund may not purchase securities on margin, except short-term credits as are

	MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND





	The business and affairs of each Fund are managed under the direction of its Board of Directors. The Board of Directors approves all significant agreements between a Fund and persons or companies
	furnishing services to it, including the Funds agreements with its Advisor, administrator, sub-administrator, custodian, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (the Transfer Agent). The Board of Directors of Global Infrastructure Fund, Global
	Realty Shares, Institutional Global Realty Shares and International Realty Fund also approve agreements with Cohen & Steers Europe, S.A. (CNS Europe), Cohen & Steers Asia Limited (CNS Asia), and
	Cohen & Steers UK Limited (CNS UK), investment sub-advisors for those Funds (the Subadvisors). The management of the Funds day-to-day operations is delegated to its officers, the Advisor, the Subadvisors (if
	applicable), the administrator and sub-administrator, subject always to the investment objective and policies of each Fund and to the general supervision of the Board of Directors.




	The Directors and officers of each Fund and their principal occupations during at least the past five years are set forth below. Each Director and officer is also a director or officer of some or all of
	the other funds in the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex.

	business administration degree from Harvard University and currently serves as a trustee of a private university.







	The
	Boards believe that the significance of each Directors experience, qualifications, attributes or skills is an individual matter (meaning that experience that is important for one Director may not have the same value for another) and that these
	factors are best evaluated at the board level, with no single Director, or particular factor, being indicative of board effectiveness. However, the Boards believe that Directors need to have the ability to critically review, evaluate, question and
	discuss information provided to them, and to interact effectively with Fund management, service providers and counsel, in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties; the Boards believe that their members satisfy
	this standard. Experience relevant to having this ability may be achieved through a Directors educational background; business, professional training or practice (

	e.g

	., accountancy or law), public service or academic positions;
	experience from service as a board member (including the Boards of the Funds) or as an executive of investment funds, public companies or significant private or not-for-profit entities or other organizations; and/or other life experiences. The
	charter for the Boards Nominating Committee contains certain other specific requirements and factors considered by the Committee in identifying and selecting Director candidates (please see below).




	 




	16







	To assist them in evaluating matters under federal and state law, the Directors are counseled by their own
	independent legal counsel, who participates in Board meetings and interacts with the Advisor, and also may benefit from information provided by the Funds and the Advisors counsel; both Board and Fund counsel have significant experience
	advising funds and fund board members. Each Board and its committees have the ability to engage other experts as appropriate. Each Board evaluates its performance on an annual basis.





	Board Composition and Leadership Structure.

	The 1940 Act requires that at least 40% of a Funds directors not be interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund and as
	such are not affiliated with the Advisor (Independent Directors). To rely on certain exemptive rules under the 1940 Act, a majority of a Funds directors must be Independent Directors, and for certain important matters, such as the
	approval of investment advisory agreements or transactions with affiliates, the Act or the rules thereunder require the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors. Currently, over 75% of the Funds Directors are Independent Directors.
	The Chairmen of the Boards are interested persons of the Funds, and the Independent Directors have designated a lead Independent Director who chairs meetings or executive sessions of the Independent Directors, reviews and comments on Board meeting
	agendas, represents the views of the Independent Directors to management and facilitates communication among the Independent Directors and their counsel. The Board has determined that its leadership structure, in which the Independent Directors have
	designated a lead Independent Director to function as described above is appropriate in light of the services that the Advisor and its affiliates provide to the Funds and potential conflicts of interest that could arise from these relationships.





	Officers of the Funds.

	The officers of the Funds (other than Messrs. Cohen and Steers, whose biographies are provided above) their


	addresses, their ages, and their principal occupations for at least the past five years are set forth below.

	Conflicts
	of Interest.

	No Director who is not an interested person (as defined in the 1940 Act) of a Fund (Independent Director) and none of their immediate family members, own any securities issued by the Advisor, or any person or
	entity (other than a Fund and other funds in the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex) directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Advisor.

	BOARDS ROLE IN FUND GOVERNANCE






	Committees.

	Each Funds Board of Directors has four standing committees, the Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee, the Contract Review Committee and the Governance Committee, each of
	which is composed solely of Independent Directors. All of the Independent Directors are members of the Nominating and Contract Review Committees. The members of the Governance Committee are Messrs. Norman, Ward and Smith. The members of the Audit
	Committee are Ms. Cohen and Messrs. Ross, Kroon and Grossman.




	The Audit, Nominating, Contract Review and Governance Committees met
	[    ], [    ], [    ] and [    ] times, respectively during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.




	The function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Funds financial reporting process. The functions of the Nominating Committee are to identify
	individuals qualified to become members of the Board of Directors in the event that a position is vacated or created, to select the Director nominees for any future meeting of shareholders and to set any necessary standards or qualifications for
	service on the Board of Directors. The Nominating Committee will consider nominees properly recommended by a Funds shareholders. Shareholders who wish to recommend a nominee should send nominations that include, among other things,
	biographical data and the qualifications of the proposed nominee to their Funds Secretary. The main functions of the Contract Review Committee are to make recommendations to the Board of Directors after reviewing advisory and other contracts
	that a Fund has with the Advisor and to select third parties to provide evaluative reports and other information regarding the services provided by the Advisor to the Board. The main function of the Governance Committee is to assist the Board in the
	oversight of appropriate and effective governance of each Fund. The Governance Committee will oversee, among other things, the structure and composition of the Board committees, the size of the Board and the compensation of Independent Directors for
	service on the Board and any Board committee.





	Boards Oversight Role in Management.

	The Boards role in management of each
	Fund is oversight. As is the case with virtually all investment companies (as distinguished from operating companies), service providers to the Funds, primarily the Advisor and its affiliates, have responsibility for the day-to-day management of the
	Funds, which includes responsibility for risk management (including management of investment performance and investment risk, valuation risk, issuer and counterparty credit risk, compliance risk and operational risk). As part of its oversight, each
	Board, acting at its scheduled meetings, or the lead Independent Director, acting between Board meetings, regularly interacts with and receives reports from senior personnel of service providers, including the Funds and the Advisors
	Chief Compliance Officer and portfolio management personnel. Each Boards audit committee (which consists of four Independent Directors (as defined below)) meets during its scheduled meetings, and between meetings the audit committee chair
	maintains contact, with the Funds independent registered public accounting firm and the Funds Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer. Each Board also receives periodic presentations from senior personnel of the Advisor or its affiliates
	regarding risk management generally, as well as periodic presentations regarding specific operational, compliance or investment areas such as business continuity, anti-money laundering, personal trading, valuation, credit, investment research and
	securities lending. Each Board also receives reports from counsel to the Fund and the Advisor and the Boards own independent legal counsel regarding regulatory compliance and governance matters. Each Boards oversight role does not make
	the Board a guarantor of the Funds investments or activities.







	COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND
	CERTAIN OFFICERS





	The following table sets forth information regarding compensation of the Directors by the Funds for the fiscal year
	ended December 31, 2009 and by the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex for the calendar year ended December 31, 2009. Officers of the Funds and Interested Directors do not receive any compensation from any Fund or any other fund in the
	Cohen & Steers Fund Complex, except for the Chief Compliance Officer, who receives less than $60,000 from any one Fund. Prior to October 1, 2009, each Independent Director was paid an annual retainer of $4,500 per fund, and a fee of
	$500 per fund for each meeting attended and is reimbursed for the expenses of attendance at such meetings. In addition, the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex pays the chairs of the Governance Committee and the Contract Review Committee each an
	annual fee of $10,000, the chair of the Audit Committee an annual fee of $15,000 and the lead Independent Director an annual fee of $50,000. As of October 1, 2009, the Independent Directors are paid by the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex
	an annual base retainer of $95,000, paid quarterly and a $10,000 per meeting fee per quarter ($40,000 annually), and such fees are allocated over the Fund Complex based on average net assets of each fund. Additionally, the Audit Committee Chairman
	is paid $15,000 per year in the aggregate for his service as Chairman of the Audit Committees of the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex, the Contract Review and Governance Committee Chairmen are paid $10,000 per year in the aggregate for their
	work in connection with the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex and the lead Independent Director is paid $50,000 per year in the aggregate for his service as lead Independent Director of the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex. In the column
	headed Total Compensation Paid to Directors by Fund Complex, the compensation paid to each Director represents the twenty-one funds* that each Director served in the fund complex during the year ended December 31, 2009. The
	Directors do not receive any pension or retirement benefits from the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex.

	THE ADVISOR





	Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. (the Advisor), a registered investment advisor, located at 280
	Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, is the investment advisor to the Funds. The Advisor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cohen & Steers, Inc., a publicly traded company whose common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the
	NYSE) under the symbol CNS. As of March 31, 2010, the Advisor managed $[            ] billion in assets.

	The Advisor also provides the Funds with such personnel as the Funds may from time to time request for the
	performance of clerical, accounting and other office services, such as coordinating matters with the sub-administrator, the Transfer Agent and the custodian, which the Advisor is not required to furnish under the Investment Advisory Agreements and
	Investment Management Agreements. The personnel rendering these services, who may act as officers of the Fund, may be employees of the Advisor or its affiliates. The cost to a Fund for these services must be agreed to by a Fund and is intended to be
	no higher than the actual cost to the Advisor or its affiliates of providing the services. Institutional Global Realty Shares, Institutional Realty Shares and Realty Shares do not pay for services performed by officers of the Advisor or its
	affiliates. The Fund may from time to time hire its own employees or contract to have services performed by third parties, and the management of the Fund intends to do so whenever it appears advantageous to the Fund.

	wholly-owned subsidiaries of CNS. References in this SAI to activities and responsibilities of the Advisor with respect to Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, Institutional Global Realty Shares and International Realty Fund may be
	performed by one or more of the Subadvisors pursuant to the Subadvisory Agreements with the Advisor.

	$[            ] million in assets, respectively.




	For their services under
	the Subadvisory Agreements between the Advisor and each Subadvisor, the Advisor (not the Subadvised Funds) pays each Subadvisor a fee. Prior to October 1, 2009, the Advisor paid CNS Europe, CNS Asia and CNS UK a monthly fee at an annual rate of
	6.3%, 6.3% and 16.3%, respectively, of the advisory fees received by the Advisor from the Subadvised Funds. As of October 31, 2009, the Advisor allocates 50% of the management or advisory fees, as applicable, received from the Subadvised Funds
	among itself and each Subadvisor based on the portion of each Subadvised Funds assets managed by the Advisor and each Subadvisor. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, the Advisor paid CNS Europe, CNS Asia and CNS UK the following
	subadvisory fees with respect to each Subadvised Fund.

	Conflicts of Interest.

	It is possible that conflicts of interest may arise in connection with the portfolio
	managers management of the Funds investments on the one hand and the investments of other accounts or vehicles for which the portfolio managers are responsible on the other. For example, a portfolio manager may have conflicts of interest
	in allocating management time, resources and investment opportunities among a Fund and the other accounts or vehicles he advises. In addition, due to differences in the investment strategies or restrictions among a Fund and the other accounts, a
	portfolio manager may take action with respect to another account that differs from the action taken with respect to the Fund. In some cases, another account managed by a portfolio manager may provide more revenue to the Advisor. While this may
	appear to create additional conflicts of interest for the portfolio manager in the allocation of management time, resources and investment opportunities, the Advisor strives to ensure that portfolio managers endeavor to exercise their discretion in
	a manner that is equitable to all interested persons. In this regard, in the absence of specific account-related impediments (such as client-imposed restrictions or lack of available cash), it is the policy of the Advisor to allocate investment
	ideas pro rata to all accounts with the same primary investment objective.




	In addition, certain of the portfolio managers may from time to
	time manage one or more accounts on behalf of the Advisor and its affiliated companies (the CNS Accounts). Certain securities held and traded in the CNS Accounts also may be held and traded in one or more client accounts. It is the
	policy of the Advisor however not to put the interests of the CNS Accounts ahead of the interests of client accounts. The Advisor may aggregate orders of client accounts with those of the CNS Accounts; however, under no circumstances will
	preferential treatment be given to the CNS Accounts. For all orders involving the CNS Accounts, purchases or sales will be allocated prior to trade placement, and orders that are only partially filled will be allocated across all accounts in
	proportion to the shares each account, including the CNS Accounts, was designated to receive prior to trading. As a result, it is expected that the CNS Accounts will receive the same average price as other accounts included in the aggregated order.
	Shares will not be allocated or re-allocated to the CNS Accounts after trade execution or after the average price is known. In the event so few shares of an order are executed that a pro-rata allocation is not practical, a rotational system of
	allocation may be used; however, the CNS Accounts will never be part of that rotation or receive shares of a partially filled order other than on a pro-rata basis.




	Because certain CNS Accounts are managed with a cash management objective, it is possible that a security will be sold out of the CNS Accounts but continue to be held for one or more client accounts. In
	situations when this occurs, such security will remain in a client account only if the portfolio manager, acting in its reasonable judgment and consistent with its fiduciary duties, believes this is appropriate for, and consistent with the
	objectives and profile of, the client account.





	Advisor Compensation Structure.

	Compensation of the Advisors portfolio managers
	and other investment professionals has three primary components: (1) a base salary, (2) an annual cash bonus and (3) annual stock-based compensation consisting generally of restricted stock units of the Advisors parent, CNS. The
	Advisors investment professionals, including the portfolio managers, also receive certain retirement, insurance and other benefits that are broadly available to all of its employees. Compensation of the Advisors investment professionals
	is reviewed primarily on an annual basis.

	Method to Determine Compensation

	. Compensation of the Advisors portfolio managers and other
	investment professionals has three primary components: (1) a base salary, (2) an annual cash bonus and (3) annual stock-based compensation consisting generally of restricted stock units of the Advisors parent, CNS. The
	Advisors investment professionals, including the portfolio managers, also receive certain retirement, insurance and other benefits that are broadly available to all of its employees. Compensation of the Advisors investment professionals
	is reviewed primarily on an annual basis.




	The Advisor compensates its portfolio managers based primarily on the total return performance of
	funds and accounts managed by the portfolio manager versus appropriate peer groups or benchmarks. In evaluating the performance of a portfolio manager, primary emphasis is normally placed on one- and three-year performance, with secondary
	consideration of performance over longer periods of time. Performance is evaluated on a pre-tax and pre-expense basis. In addition to rankings within peer groups of funds on the basis of absolute performance, consideration may also be given to
	risk-adjusted performance. For funds and accounts with a primary investment objective of current income, consideration will also be given to the funds and accounts success in achieving this objective. For portfolio managers responsible
	for multiple funds and accounts, investment performance is evaluated on an aggregate basis. The Advisor does not have any funds or accounts with performance-based advisory fees. Portfolio managers are also evaluated on the basis of their success in
	managing their dedicated team of analysts. Base compensation for portfolio managers of the Advisor varies in line with the portfolio managers seniority and position with the firm.




	Salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation are also influenced by the operating performance of the Advisor and CNS. While the annual salaries of the Advisors portfolio managers are fixed, cash
	bonuses and stock based compensation may fluctuate significantly from year to year, based on changes in manager performance and other factors.





	ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES





	The Advisor performs certain administrative functions for each Fund, including (i) providing
	office space, telephone, office equipment and supplies for each Fund; (ii) paying the compensation of each Funds officers for services rendered as such; (iii) authorizing expenditures and approving bills for payment on behalf of each
	Fund; (iv) supervising preparation of the periodic updating of each Funds registration statement, including the Prospectuses and SAI, for the purpose of filings with the SEC and state securities administrators and monitoring and
	maintaining the effectiveness of such filings, as appropriate; (v) supervising preparation of quarterly reports to each Funds shareholders, notices of dividends, capital gains distributions and tax credits, and attending to routine
	correspondence and other communications with individual shareholders; (vi) supervising the daily pricing of each Funds investment portfolio and the publication of the NAV of each Funds shares, earnings reports and other financial
	data; (vii) monitoring relationships with organizations providing services to each Fund, including the custodian, Transfer Agent and printers; (viii) providing trading desk facilities for each Fund; (ix) supervising compliance by each
	Fund with recordkeeping requirements under the 1940 Act and regulations thereunder, maintaining books and records for each Fund (other than those maintained by the custodian and Transfer Agent) and preparing and filing of tax reports other than each
	Funds income tax returns; and (x) providing executive, clerical and secretarial help needed to carry out these responsibilities.




	The Advisor provides these administrative services to Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund, Realty Income Fund and Realty Shares pursuant to an administration agreement with each Fund (the
	Administration Agreement). For its services under the Administration Agreement, the Advisor receives a monthly fee from each of the foregoing Funds at the annual rate of 0.02% of each Funds average daily net assets (0.06% in the
	case of International Realty Fund). The Advisor provides these administrative services to Institutional Global Realty Shares and Institutional Realty Shares pursuant to each Funds Investment Management Agreement, at no additional fee to these
	Funds other than the fees paid under each Investment Management Agreement.




	In accordance with the terms of the Administration Agreements or
	Investment Management Agreements, as applicable, and with the approval of each Funds Board of Directors, the Advisor has caused each Fund to retain State Street Bank and Trust Company (State Street) as sub-administrator under a
	fund accounting and administration agreement (the Sub-Administration Agreement) with each Fund. Under the Sub-Administration Agreement, State Street has assumed responsibility for performing certain of the foregoing administrative
	functions, including (i) determining each Funds NAV and preparing these figures for publication; (ii) maintaining certain of each Funds books and records that are not maintained by the Advisor, custodian or Transfer Agent;
	(iii) preparing financial information for each Funds income tax returns, proxy statements, shareholders reports, and SEC filings and (iv) responding to shareholder inquiries. The Advisor remains responsible for monitoring and
	overseeing the performance by State Street of its obligations to each Fund under the Sub-administration Agreement, subject to the overall authority of each Funds Board of Directors.




	Under the terms of the Sub-Administration Agreement, Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund, Realty Income Fund and
	Realty Shares each pay State Street a monthly administration fee computed on the basis of the aggregate net assets of all the funds in the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex at an annual rate equal to 0.03% of the first $2.2 billion in assets,
	0.02% of the next $2.2 billion, and 0.01% of assets in excess of $4.4 billion, with a minimum fee per Fund of $120,000. The aggregate fee paid by each Fund and the other funds in the Cohen & Steers Fund Complex to State Street is computed
	by calculating the effective rate for all the funds and multiplying the monthly average net assets of each respective fund in the complex by that effective rate. For those funds with preferred shares outstanding, the monthly average net assets will
	be adjusted by the monthly average liquidation value of the preferred shares. Each of Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund, Realty Income Fund and Realty Shares is then responsible for its pro rata amount of
	the aggregate administration fee. In the case of Institutional Global Realty Shares and Institutional Realty Shares, the Advisor pays for the cost of State Streets services without any additional charge to those Funds.




	State Street also serves as the Funds custodian. See Custodian and Transfer and Dividend Disbursing Agent, below. Boston Financial Data
	Services (Boston Financial), an affiliate of State Street, has been retained by State Street to provide transfer agency services.

	DISTRIBUTOR





	Cohen & Steers Securities, LLC located at 280 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017 (the Distributor) serves as the Distributor of shares of each Fund.




	For Class A) and Class C shares of Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund, and Realty Income Fund, and for Class B
	shares of Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares and Realty Income Fund, the Distributor receives compensation as described below under each Funds Distribution Plan.




	With respect to Institutional Global Realty Shares, Institutional Realty Shares and Realty Shares, which each offer only one class of shares and which do not charge a sales load, the Distributor serves
	without compensation.




	The Distributor is not obligated to sell any specific amount of shares of any Fund and will sell shares, as agent for
	each Fund, on a continuous basis only against orders to purchase shares.




	The Distributor is an affiliated person of the Advisor,
	which is itself an affiliated person of each Fund. The Distributor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNS. Those individuals identified above under Management of the Fund as Directors or officers of both the Funds and the Distributor are
	affiliated persons of both entities.




	For the last three fiscal years, the Distributor received the following combined commissions on sales of
	Class A and Class C shares of Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund and Realty Income Fund:

	CUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AND DIVIDEND DISBURSING AGENT





	State Street, which has its principal business at One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, has been retained to act as custodian of each Funds
	investments. The Transfer Agent provides transfer and dividend disbursing agency services to each Fund.




	Neither State Street nor the Transfer
	Agent has any part in deciding a Funds investment policies or which securities are to be purchased or sold for a Funds portfolio.








	CODE OF ETHICS





	The Funds, the Advisor, the Subadvisors and the Distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1
	under the 1940 Act and with respect to the Advisor and Subadvisors, Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Acts of 1940, as amended, that is designed to ensure that the interests of Fund shareholders come before the interests of those involved in
	managing the Funds. The code of ethics, among other things, prohibits personnel of the Advisor, the Subadvisors and the Distributor from investing in REITs and real estate securities, preferred securities and initial public offerings; requires
	pre-approval for transactions in private placements and most other securities transactions (including transactions in Cohen & Steers closed-end funds); and requires pre-approval for sales of shares of Cohen & Steers open-end funds.
	The Funds Independent Directors are prohibited from purchasing or selling any security if they know or reasonably should know at the time of the transaction that the security is being considered for purchase or sale by a Fund or is being
	purchased or sold by a Fund.





	PROXY VOTING





	The Funds Board of Directors has delegated to the Advisor and, as applicable, the Subadvisors the responsibility for voting proxies on behalf of each Fund, and has determined that the Advisor and,
	as applicable, the Subadvisor will vote proxies with respect to those portfolio securities for which they have investment responsibility. The following is a summary of the Advisors and Subadvisors Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures.




	Voting rights are an important component of corporate governance. The Advisor and the Subadvisors have three overall objectives in exercising
	voting rights:




	A.

	Responsibility.

	The Advisor and the Subadvisors shall seek to ensure that there is an effective means in place to
	hold companies accountable for their actions. While management must be accountable to its board, the board must be accountable to a companys shareholders. Although accountability can be promoted in a variety of ways, protecting shareholder
	voting rights may be among our most important tools.




	 




	30







	B.

	Rationalizing Management and Shareholder Concerns.

	The Advisor and the Subadvisors seek to ensure
	that the interests of a companys management and board are aligned with those of the companys shareholders. In this respect, compensation must be structured to reward the creation of shareholder value.




	C.

	Shareholder Communication.

	Since companies are owned by their shareholders, the Advisor and the Subadvisors seek to ensure that management
	effectively communicates with its owners about the companys business operations and financial performance. It is only with effective communication that shareholders will be able to assess the performance of management and to make informed
	decisions on when to buy, sell or hold a companys securities.




	In exercising voting rights, the Advisor and the Subadvisors follow the
	general principles set forth below.



	 





	




	 





	The ability to exercise a voting right with respect to a security is a valuable right and, therefore, must be viewed as part of the asset itself.






	 





	




	 





	In exercising voting rights, the Advisor and the Subadvisors shall engage in a careful evaluation of issues that may materially affect the rights of
	shareholders and the value of the security.






	 





	




	 





	Consistent with general fiduciary principles, the exercise of voting rights shall always be conducted with reasonable care, prudence and diligence.






	 





	




	 





	In exercising voting rights on behalf of clients, the Advisor and the Subadvisors shall conduct itself in the same manner as if the Advisor and the
	Subadvisors were the constructive owners of the securities.






	 





	




	 





	To the extent reasonably possible, the Advisor and the Subadvisors shall participate in each shareholder voting opportunity.






	 





	




	 





	Voting rights shall not automatically be exercised in favor of management-supported proposals.






	 





	




	 





	The Advisor and the Subadvisors, and their respective officers and employees, shall never accept any item of value in consideration of a favorable
	proxy voting decision.







	Set forth below are general guidelines followed by the Advisor and the Subadvisors in exercising
	proxy voting rights:





	Prudence

	. In making a proxy voting decision, the Advisor and the Subadvisors shall give appropriate consideration
	to all relevant facts and circumstances, including the value of the securities to be voted and the likely effect any vote may have on that value. Since voting rights must be exercised on the basis of an informed judgment, investigation shall be a
	critical initial step.





	Third Party Views

	. While the Advisor and the Subadvisors may consider the views of third parties, the Advisor
	and the Subadvisors shall never base a proxy voting decision solely on the opinion of a third party. Rather, decisions shall be based on a reasonable and good faith determination as to how best to maximize shareholder value.





	Shareholder Value.

	Just as the decision whether to purchase or sell a security is a matter of judgment, determining whether a specific proxy
	resolution will increase the market value of a security is a matter of judgment as to which informed parties may differ. In determining how a proxy vote may affect the economic value of a security, the Advisor and the Subadvisors shall consider both
	short-term and long-term views about a companys business and prospects, especially in light of its projected holding period on the stock (e.g., the Advisor may discount long-term views on a short-term holding).




	Set forth below are guidelines as to how specific proxy voting issues shall be analyzed and assessed by the Advisor and the Subadvisors. While these
	guidelines will provide a framework for the Advisors and the Subadvisors decision making process, the mechanical application of these guidelines can never address all proxy voting decisions. When new issues arise or old issues present
	nuances not encountered before, the Advisor and the Subadvisors must be guided by their reasonable judgment to vote in a manner that the Advisor deems to be in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. In addition, because the regulatory
	framework and the business cultures and practices vary from region to region, the below general guidelines may be inconsistent in certain circumstances for proxies of issuers of securities in Europe and Asia.





	Uncontested Director Elections





	Votes on
	director nominees should be made on a case-by-case basis using a mosaic approach, where all factors are considered in director elections and where no single issue is deemed to be determinative. For example, a nominees experience
	and business judgment may be critical to the long-term success of the portfolio company, notwithstanding the fact that he or she may serve on the board of more than four public companies. In evaluating nominees, Advisor and the Subadvisors consider
	the following factors:



	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee attended less than 75 percent of the board and committee meetings without a valid excuse for the absences;






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee is an inside or affiliated outside director and sits on the audit, compensation, or nominating committees;






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee ignored a significant shareholder proposal that was approved by a (i) majority of the shares outstanding or (ii) majority
	of the votes cast for two consecutive years;






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee, without shareholder approval, to the Advisors and Subadvisors knowledge instituted a new poison pill plan, extended an
	existing plan, or adopted a new plan upon the expiration of an existing plan during the past year;






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee is an inside or affiliated outside director and the full board serves as the audit, compensation, or nominating committee or the
	company does not have one of these committees;






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee is an insider or affiliated outsider on boards that are not at least majority independent;






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee is the CEO of a publicly-traded company who serves on more than two public boards;






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee serves on more than four public company boards;






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee serves on the audit committee where there is evidence (such as audit reports or reports mandated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) that
	there exists material weaknesses in the companys internal controls;







	 




	31









	




	 





	Whether the nominee serves on the compensation committee if that director was present at the time of the grant of backdated options or options the
	pricing or the timing of which Advisor and the Subadvisors believe may have been manipulated to provide additional benefits to executives;






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee is believed by the Advisor and the Subadvisors to have a material conflict of interest with the portfolio company; and






	 





	




	 





	Whether the nominee (or the overall board) in the Advisors and Subadvisors view has a record of making poor corporate or strategic
	decisions or has demonstrated an overall lack of good business judgment.







	The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote on a
	case-by-case basis for shareholder proposals requesting companies to amend their bylaws in order to create access to the proxy so as to nominate candidates for directors. The Advisor and the Subadvisors recognize the importance of shareholder access
	to the ballot process as a means to ensure that boards do not become self-perpetuating and self-serving. However, the Advisor and the Subadvisors are also aware that some proposals may promote certain interest groups and could be disruptive to the
	nomination process. Special attention will be paid to companies that display a chronic lack of shareholder accountability.






	Proxy Contests







	Director Nominees in a Contested Election

	. By definition, this type of board candidate or slate
	runs for the purpose of seeking a significant change in corporate policy or control. Therefore, the economic impact of the vote in favor of or in opposition to that director or slate must be analyzed using a higher standard such as is normally
	applied to changes in control. Criteria for evaluating director nominees as a group or individually should also include: the underlying reason why the new slate (or individual director) is being proposed; performance; compensation; corporate
	governance provisions and takeover activity; criminal activity; attendance at meetings; investment in the company; interlocking directorships; inside, outside and independent directors; number of other board seats; and other experience. It is
	impossible to have a general policy regarding director nominees in a contested election.





	Reimbursement of Proxy Solicitation Expenses.

	Decisions to provide full reimbursement for dissidents waging a proxy contest should be made on a case-by-case basis.






	Ratification of Auditors






	The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for proposals to ratify auditors, unless an auditor has a
	financial interest in or association with the company, and are therefore not independent; or there is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered an opinion that is neither accurate nor indicative of the companys financial
	position. Generally, the Advisor and the Subadvisors vote against auditor ratification and withhold votes from audit committee members if non-audit fees exceed audit fees. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote on a case-by-case basis on auditor
	rotation proposals. Criteria for evaluating the rotation proposal include, but are not limited to: tenure of the audit firm; establishment and disclosure of a renewal process whereby the auditor is regularly evaluated for both audit quality and
	competitive price; length of the rotation period advocated in the proposal; and any significant audit related issues. Generally, the Advisor and the Subadvisors vote against auditor indemnification and limitation of liability; however the Advisor
	and the Subadvisors recognize there may be situations where indemnification and limitations on liability may be appropriate.






	Takeover Defenses






	While the Advisor and the Subadvisors recognize that a takeover attempt can be a significant
	distraction for the board and management to deal with, the simple fact is that the possibility of a corporate takeover keeps management focused on maximizing shareholder value. As a result, the Advisor and the Subadvisors oppose measures that are
	designed to prevent or obstruct corporate takeovers because they can entrench current management. The following are our guidelines on change of control issues:





	Shareholder Rights Plans

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors acknowledge that there are arguments for and against shareholder rights plans, also known as poison pills. Companies should put
	their case for rights plans to shareholders. The Advisor and the Subadvisors review on a case-by-case basis management proposals to ratify a poison pill. The Advisor and the Subadvisors generally look for shareholder friendly features including a
	two- to three-year sunset provision, a permitted bid provision and a 20 percent or higher flip-in provision.





	Greenmail

	. The Advisor
	and the Subadvisors vote for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise restricts a companys ability to make greenmail payments.





	Unequal Voting Rights

	. Generally, the Advisor and the Subadvisors vote against dual-class recapitalizations as they offer an effective way for a firm to thwart hostile takeovers by concentrating
	voting power in the hands of management or other insiders.





	Classified Boards

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors generally vote in favor
	of shareholder proposals to declassify a board of directors, although the Advisor and the Subadvisors acknowledge that a classified board may be in the long-term best interests of a company in certain situations. In voting on shareholder proposals
	to declassify a board of directors, the Advisor and the Subadvisors evaluate all facts and circumstances surrounding such proposal, including whether the shareholder proposing the de-classification has an agenda in making such proposal that may be
	at odds with the long-term best interests of the company or whether it would be in the best interests of the company to thwart a shareholders attempt to control the board of directors.





	Cumulative Voting

	. Having the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directorsthat is, cast more than one vote for a director about whom
	they feel stronglygenerally increases shareholders rights to effect change in the management of a corporation. The Advisor and the Subadvisors generally support, therefore, proposals to adopt cumulative voting.

	Shareholder Ability to Call Special Meeting

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote on a case-by-case
	basis for shareholder proposals requesting companies to amend their governance documents (bylaws and/or charter) in order to allow shareholders to call special meetings. The Advisor and the Subadvisors recognize the importance of shareholder ability
	to call a special meeting, however, The Advisor and the Subadvisors are also aware that some proposals are put forth in order to promote the agenda(s) of certain special interest groups and could be disruptive to the management of the company.





	Shareholder Ability to Act by Written Consent

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors generally vote against proposals to allow or facilitate
	shareholder action by written consent. The requirement that all shareholders be given notice of a shareholders meeting and matters to be discussed therein seems to provide a reasonable protection of minority shareholder rights.





	Shareholder Ability to Alter the Size of the Board

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors generally vote for proposals that seek to fix the size of the
	board and vote against proposals that give management the ability to alter the size of the board without shareholder approval. While the Advisor and the Subadvisors recognize the importance of such proposals, the Advisor and the Subadvisors are,
	however, also aware that these proposals are sometimes put forth in order to promote the agenda(s) of certain special interest groups and could be disruptive to the management of the company.






	Miscellaneous Board Provisions







	Board Committees

	. Boards should delegate key oversight functions, such as responsibility for audit, nominating and compensation issues, to independent committees. The chairman and members of any
	committee should be clearly identified in the annual report. Any committee should have the authority to engage independent advisors where appropriate at the companys expense.




	Audit, nominating and compensation committees should consist solely of non-employee directors, who are independent of management.





	Separate Chairman and CEO Positions

	. The Advisor will generally vote for proposals looking to separate the CEO and Chairman roles. The Advisor and the Subadvisors do acknowledge, however, that
	under certain circumstances, it may be reasonable for the CEO and Chairman roles to be held by a single person.





	Lead Directors and
	Executive Sessions

	. In cases where the CEO and Chairman roles are combined, the Advisor and the Subadvisors will vote for the appointment of a lead (non-insider) director and for regular executive sessions (board meetings
	taking place without the CEO/Chairman present).





	Majority of Independent Directors

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for proposals
	that call for the board to be composed of a majority of independent directors. The Advisor and the Subadvisors believe that a majority of independent directors can be an important factor in facilitating objective decision making and enhancing
	accountability to shareholders.





	Independent Committees

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for shareholder proposals requesting that
	the boards audit, compensation, and nominating committees consist exclusively of independent directors.





	Stock Ownership
	Requirements

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors support measures requiring senior executives to hold a minimum amount of stock in a company (often expressed as a percentage of annual compensation), requiring stock acquired through option exercise
	to be held for a certain minimum amount of time and issuing restricted stock awards instead of options.





	Term of Office

	. The Advisor
	and the Subadvisors vote against shareholder proposals to limit the tenure of outside directors. Term limits pose artificial and arbitrary impositions on the board and could harm shareholder interests by forcing experienced and knowledgeable
	directors off the board.





	Director and Officer Indemnification and Liability Protection

	. Proposals concerning director and officer
	indemnification and liability protection should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.





	Board Size.

	The Advisor and the Subadvisors
	generally vote for proposals to limit the size of the board to 15 members or less.





	Majority Vote Standard.

	The Advisor and the
	Subadvisors generally vote for proposals asking for the board to initiate the appropriate process to amend the companys governance documents (charter or bylaws) to provide that director nominees shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the
	majority of votes cast at an annual meeting of shareholders. The Advisor and the Subadvisors would generally review on a case-by-case basis proposals that address alternative approaches to a majority vote requirement.





	Confidential Voting.

	The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for shareholder proposals requesting that companies adopt confidential voting, use
	independent tabulators, and use independent inspectors of election as long as the proposals include clauses for proxy contests as follows: in the case of a contested election, management should be permitted to request that the dissident group honor
	its confidential voting policy. If the dissidents agree, the policy remains in place. If the dissidents do not agree, the confidential voting policy is waived.




	The Advisor and the Subadvisors also vote for management proposals to adopt confidential voting.





	Bundled Proposals.

	The Advisor and the Subadvisors review on a case-by-case basis bundled or conditioned proxy proposals. In the case of items that are conditioned upon each other, the Advisor and the Subadvisors examine
	the benefits and costs of the packaged items. In instances where the joint effect of the conditioned items is not in shareholders best interests, The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote against the proposals. If the combined effect is positive,
	the Advisor and the Subadvisors support such proposals.





	Date/Location of Meeting.

	The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote against
	shareholder proposals to change the date or location of the shareholders meeting. No one site will meet the needs of all shareholders.





	Adjourn Meeting if Votes are Insufficient.

	Open-ended requests for adjournment of a shareholder meeting generally will not be supported. However, where management specifically states the reason for requesting an adjournment and
	the requested adjournment is necessary to permit a proposal that would otherwise be supported under this policy to be carried out; the adjournment request will be supported.





	Disclosure of Shareholder Proponents.

	The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for shareholder proposals requesting that companies disclose the names of shareholder proponents. Shareholders may wish to
	contact the proponents of a shareholder proposal for additional information.

	Capital Structure







	Increase Additional Common Stock.

	The Advisor and the Subadvisors generally vote for increases in authorized shares, provided that the increase is not
	greater than three times the number of shares outstanding and reserved for issuance (including shares reserved for stock-related plans and securities convertible into common stock, but not shares reserved for any poison pill plan). Votes generally
	are cast in favor of proposals to authorize additional shares of stock except where the proposal:



	 





	




	 





	creates a blank check preferred stock; or






	 





	




	 





	establishes classes of stock with superior voting rights.








	Blank Check Preferred Stock.

	Votes generally are cast in opposition to management proposals authorizing the creation of new classes of preferred stock with unspecific voting, conversion,
	distribution and other rights, and management proposals to increase the number of authorized blank check preferred shares. The Advisor and the Subadvisors may vote in favor of this type of proposal when they receive assurances to its reasonable
	satisfaction that (i) the preferred stock was authorized by the board for the use of legitimate capital formation purposes and not for anti-takeover purposes, and (ii) no preferred stock will be issued with voting power that is
	disproportionate to the economic interests of the preferred stock. These representations should be made either in the proxy statement or in a separate letter from the company to the Advisor and, as applicable, the Subadvisors.





	Preemptive Rights.

	Votes regarding shareholder proposals seeking preemptive rights are determined on a case-by-case basis after evaluating:



	 





	




	 





	the size of the company;






	 





	




	 





	the shareholder base; and






	 





	




	 





	the liquidity of the stock.







	For example, it would be difficult to support a shareholder proposal that would require an S&P 500 company with over $1 billion in equity held by thousands of shareholders (with no single shareholder owning a significant percentage of
	outstanding shares) to implement preemptive rights each time it conducted a new offering. Such a requirement would be impractical and extremely costly. Moreover, at companies with that large of a shareholder base and the ease with which shareholders
	could preserve their relative interest through purchases of shares on the open market, the cost of implementing preemptive rights does not seem justifiable in relation to the benefits.





	Dual Class Capitalizations.

	Because classes of common stock with unequal voting rights limit the rights of certain shareholders, the Advisor and the Subadvisors vote against adoption of a dual or
	multiple class capitalization structure.





	Restructurings/Recapitalizations

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors review proposals to
	increase common and/or preferred shares and to issue shares as part of a debt restructuring plan on a case-by-case basis. In voting, the Advisor and the Subadvisors consider the following issues:



	 





	




	 





	dilutionhow much will ownership interest of existing shareholders be reduced, and how extreme will dilution to any future earnings be?






	 





	




	 





	change in controlwill the transaction result in a change in control of the company?






	 





	




	 





	bankruptcygenerally, approve proposals that facilitate debt restructurings unless there are clear signs of self-dealing or other abuses.








	Share Repurchase Programs

	. Boards may institute share repurchase or stock buy-back programs for a number of
	reasons. The Advisor and the Subadvisors will generally vote in favor of such programs where the repurchase would be in the long-term best interests of shareholders, and where the company is not thought to be able to use the cash in a more useful
	way.




	The Advisor and the Subadvisors will vote against such programs when shareholders interests could be better served by deployment
	of the cash for alternative uses, or where the repurchase is a defensive maneuver or an attempt to entrench management.





	Targeted Share
	Placements

	. These shareholder proposals ask companies to seek shareholder approval before placing 10% or more of their voting stock with a single investor. The proposals are typically in reaction to the placement by various companies of a large
	block of their voting stock in an ESOP, parent capital fund or with a single friendly investor, with the aim of protecting themselves against a hostile tender offer. These proposals are voted on a case-by-case basis after reviewing the individual
	situation of the company receiving the proposal.






	Executive and Director Compensation







	Stock-based Incentive Plans

	. Votes with respect to compensation plans should be determined on a case-by-case basis. The analysis of compensation plans
	focuses primarily on the transfer of shareholder wealth (the dollar cost of pay plans to shareholders). Other matters included in our analysis are the amount of the companys outstanding stock to be reserved for the award of stock options or
	restricted stock, whether the exercise price of an option is less than the stocks fair market value at the date of the grant of the options, and whether the plan provides for the exchange of outstanding options for new ones at lower exercise
	prices. Every award type is valued. An estimated dollar cost for the proposed plan and all continuing plans is derived. This cost, dilution to shareholders equity, will also be expressed as a percentage figure for the transfer of shareholder
	wealth and will be considered along with dilution to voting power. Once the cost of the plan is estimated, it is compared to an allowable industry-specific and market cap-based dilution cap.




	If the proposed plan cost is above the allowable cap, an against vote is indicated. If the proposed cost is below the allowable cap, a vote for the plan is
	indicated unless the plan violates the repricing guidelines. If the company has a history of repricing options or has the express ability to reprice underwater stock options without first securing shareholder approval under the proposed plan, the
	plan receives an against voteeven in cases where the plan cost is considered acceptable based on the quantitative analysis.




	The Advisor
	and the Subadvisors vote against equity plans that have high average three year burn rates, unless the company has publicly committed to reduce the burn rate to a rate that is comparable to its peer group (as determined by the Advisor).




	 




	34








	Approval of Cash or Cash-and-Stock Bonus Plans

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for cash or
	cash-and-stock bonus plans to exempt the compensation from limits on deductibility under the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).





	Executive Compensation

	. Executive compensation should be tied to the performance of the executive and the company as well as relevant market
	conditions. The Advisor and the Subadvisors feel that the performance criteria and specific amounts and types of executive compensation are best decided by a companys board of directors and/or its compensation committee and fully disclosed to
	shareholders. The Advisor will, however, vote for shareholder proposals that call for shareholders to vote, in a non-binding manner, on executive pay since such vote is non-binding and is merely informative for the board of directors and/or
	compensation committee. Further, the Advisor and the Subadvisors generally vote for shareholder proposals that seek additional disclosure of executive and director pay information.





	Reload/Evergreen Features

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors will generally vote against plans that enable the issuance of reload options and that provide an automatic share replenishment
	(evergreen) feature.





	Golden Parachutes.

	The Advisor and the Subadvisors oppose the use of accelerated employment contracts
	that result in cash grants of greater than three times annual compensation (salary and bonus) in the event of termination of employment following a change in control of a company. In general, the guidelines call for voting against golden
	parachute plans because they impede potential takeovers that shareholders should be free to consider. The Advisor and the Subadvisors generally withhold their votes at the next shareholder meeting for directors whom to its knowledge approved
	golden parachutes.





	401(k) Employee Benefit Plans

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for proposals to implement a 401(k) savings
	plan for employees.





	Employee Stock Purchase Plans

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors support employee stock purchase plans, although the
	Advisor and the Subadvisors generally believe the discounted purchase price should be at least 85% of the current market price.





	Option
	Expensing

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for shareholder proposals to expense fixed-price options.





	Vesting

	. The Advisor and
	the Subadvisors believe that restricted stock awards normally should vest over at least a two-year period.





	Option Repricing

	. The
	Advisor and the Subadvisors believe that stock options generally should not be re-priced, and never should be re-priced without shareholder approval. In addition, companies should not issue new options, with a lower strike price, to make up for
	previously issued options that are substantially underwater. The Advisor will vote against the election of any slate of directors that, to its knowledge, has authorized a company to re-price or replace underwater options during the most recent year
	without shareholder approval.





	Stock Holding Periods

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors generally vote against all proposals requiring
	executives to hold the stock received upon option exercise for a specific period of time.





	Transferable Stock Options

	. The Advisor and
	the Subadvisors review on a case-by-case basis proposals to grant transferable stock options or otherwise permit the transfer of outstanding stock options, including cost of proposal and alignment with shareholder interests.





	Recoup Bonuses

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote on a case-by-case on shareholder proposals to recoup unearned incentive bonuses or other
	incentive payments made to senior executives if it is later determined that fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly contributed to a restatement of financial results that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation.






	Incorporation







	Reincorporation Outside of the United States

	. Generally, the Advisor and the Subadvisors will vote against companies looking to reincorporate outside of the U.S.





	Voting on State Takeover Statutes

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors review on a case-by-case basis proposals to opt in or out of state takeover statutes (including control share acquisition
	statutes, control share cash-out statutes, freeze out provisions, fair price provisions, stakeholder laws, poison pill endorsements, severance pay and labor contract provisions, anti greenmail provisions, and disgorgement provisions). In voting on
	these shareholder proposals, The Advisor and the Subadvisors evaluate all facts and circumstances surrounding such proposal, including whether the shareholder proposing such measure has an agenda in making such proposal that may be at odds with the
	long-term best interests of the company or whether it would be in the best interests of the company to thwart a shareholders attempt to control the board of directors.





	Voting on Reincorporation Proposals

	. Proposals to change a companys state of incorporation are examined on a case-by-case basis. In making its decision, the Advisor and the Subadvisors review
	managements rationale for the proposal, changes to the charter/bylaws, and differences in the state laws governing the companies.






	Mergers and Corporate Restructurings







	Mergers and Acquisitions

	. Votes on
	mergers and acquisitions should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors including the following: anticipated financial and operating benefits; offer price (cost vs. premium); prospects of the combined companies; how the
	deal was negotiated; and changes in corporate governance and their impact on shareholder rights.




	The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote against
	proposals that require a super-majority of shareholders to approve a merger or other significant business combination. The Advisor and the Subadvisors support proposals that seek to lower super-majority voting requirements.





	Nonfinancial Effects of a Merger or Acquisition

	. Some companies have proposed a charter provision which specifies that the board of directors may
	examine the nonfinancial effect of a merger or acquisition on the company. This provision would allow the board to evaluate the impact a proposed change in control would have on employees, host communities, suppliers and/or others. The Advisor and
	the Subadvisors generally vote against proposals to adopt such charter provisions. The Advisor and the Subadvisors feel it is the directors fiduciary duty to base decisions solely on the financial interests of the shareholders.





	Corporate Restructuring

	. Votes on corporate restructuring proposals, including minority squeeze outs, leveraged buyouts, going private
	proposals, spin-offs, liquidations, and asset sales, should be considered on a case-by-case basis.




	 




	35








	Spin-offs

	. Votes on spin-offs should be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the tax and
	regulatory advantages, planned use of sale proceeds, market focus, and managerial incentives.





	Asset Sales

	. Votes on asset sales should
	be made on a case-by-case basis after considering the impact on the balance sheet/working capital, value received for the asset, and potential elimination of diseconomies.





	Liquidations

	. Votes on liquidations should be made on a case-by-case basis after reviewing managements efforts to pursue other alternatives, appraisal value of assets, and the compensation
	plan for executives managing the liquidation.





	Appraisal Rights

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for proposals to restore, or
	provide shareholders with, rights of appraisal. Rights of appraisal provide shareholders who are not satisfied with the terms of certain corporate transactions the right to demand a judicial review in order to determine a fair value for their
	shares.





	Changing Corporate Name

	. The Advisor and the Subadvisors vote for changing the corporate name.






	Social Issues






	The
	Advisor and the Subadvisors believe that it is the responsibility of the board and management to run a company on a daily basis. With this in mind, in the absence of unusual circumstances, the Advisor and the Subadvisors do not believe that
	shareholders should be involved in determining how a company should address broad social and policy issues. As a result, the Advisor generally votes against these types of proposals, which are generally initiated by shareholders, unless the Advisor
	and the Subadvisors believes the proposal has significant economic implications.




	Each Fund is required to file Form N-PX, with its complete
	proxy voting record for the 12 months ended June 30th, no later than August 31st of each year. Each Funds Form N-PX filings are available (i) without charge, upon request, by calling toll-free at (800) 437-9912 and



	(ii) on the SECs website (http://www.sec.gov).







	PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS AND BROKERAGE





	Subject to the supervision of the Board of Directors, decisions to buy and sell securities for a Fund and negotiation of its brokerage
	commission rates are made by the Advisor and, as applicable, the Subadvisors. Transactions on U.S. and, as applicable, non-U.S. stock exchanges involve the payment by a Fund of negotiated brokerage commissions. There is generally no stated
	commission in the case of securities traded in the over-the-counter market but the price paid by a Fund usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or mark-up. In certain instances, a Fund may make purchases of underwritten or agency placed
	issues at prices that reflect underwriting or placement fees. In accordance with procedures approved by the Board, and subject to its supervision, a Fund may purchase securities in offerings for which an affiliate of the Advisor receives a fee for
	serving as placement agent to the issuer. The Advisor and, as applicable, the Subadvisors will only cause a Fund to engage in these transactions if the Advisor and Subadvisors deem such participation to be in the best interests of the Fund. In
	certain circumstances, regulatory restrictions may prevent a Fund from purchasing securities in an offering in which an affiliate serves as placement agent of the issuer, and that Funds inability to participate could be deemed to be to the
	detriment of the Fund.




	In selecting a broker to execute each particular transaction, the Advisor and, as applicable, each Subadvisor will
	take the following into consideration: the best net price available; the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker; the size and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of the expected contribution of the broker to the
	investment performance of each Fund on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the cost of the brokerage commissions to a Fund in any transaction may be greater than that available from other brokers if the difference is reasonably justified by other
	aspects of the portfolio execution services offered.




	In addition, the Advisor and each Subadvisor may receive research services from a broker
	in connection with initiating portfolio transactions for the Fund. Research services include pricing and market data services. The Advisor and each Subadvisors shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty solely by
	reason of its having caused a Fund to pay a broker an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker would have charged solely for execution services for that transaction if
	the Advisor and, if applicable, each Subadvisor determine in good faith that the commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the research service provided.




	Research and investment information is provided by these and other brokers at no cost to the Advisor and the Subadvisors and is available for the benefit of other accounts advised by the Advisor or
	Subadvisors and their affiliates, and not all of the information will be used in connection with a Fund. While this information may be useful in varying degrees and may tend to reduce the Advisors or Subadvisors expenses, it is not
	possible to estimate its value and in the opinion of the Advisor and the Subadvisors it does not reduce their respective expenses in a determinable amount.




	The extent to which the Advisor or Subadvisors make use of statistical, research and other services furnished by brokers is considered by the Advisor or Subadvisors in the allocation of brokerage business
	but there is no formula by which such business is allocated. The Advisor or Subadvisors do so in accordance with its judgment of the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. The Advisor or Subadvisors may also take into account payments made
	by brokers effecting transactions for a Fund to other persons on behalf of a Fund for services provided to it for which it would be obligated to pay (such as custodial and professional fees).

	The authorized shares of
	the Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund and Realty Income Fund (each, a Multiclass Fund and collectively, the Multiclass Funds) are currently divided into four classes designated
	Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock and Class I Common Stock. Class B Common Stock of International Realty Fund is not currently offered for sale, and Class B shares of Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty
	Shares and Realty Income Fund are no longer being offered except through dividend reinvestment and permitted exchanges by existing Class B shareholders.




	Institutional Global Realty Shares, Institutional Realty Shares and Realty shares each presently have one class of shares.




	Each Fund shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, have the right, at its option, at any time to redeem shares owned by any shareholder if the Board of Directors has determined that it is in the
	best interest of that Fund to redeem the shares. The Funds shares have no preemptive or conversion rights. With respect to the Multiclass Funds, each class of shares represents an interest in the same assets of the Fund and is identical in all
	respects except that (i) each class is subject to different sales charges and distributions and service fees, which may affect performance, and (ii) each class has exclusive voting rights on any matter submitted to shareholders that
	relates solely to its arrangement and has separate voting rights on any matter submitted to shareholders in which the interests of one class differ from the interests of any other class. With the exceptions noted above for Multiclass Funds, all
	shares of a Fund have equal voting, dividend, distribution and liquidation rights. All shares of the Funds, when duly issued, will be fully paid and nonassessable. Shareholders are entitled to one vote per share. All voting rights for the election
	of Directors are noncumulative, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the shares outstanding can elect 100% of the directors then nominated for election if they choose to do so and, in such event, the holders of the remaining shares will
	not be able to elect any Directors. The foregoing description is subject to the provisions contained in each Funds Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws as amended and supplemented from time-to-time.




	 




	37







	The Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify and issue any unissued shares of a Fund without
	shareholder approval. Accordingly, in the future, the Board of Directors may create additional series of shares with different investment objectives, policies or restrictions. Any issuance of shares of another class would be governed by the 1940 Act
	and Maryland law.

	DISTRIBUTION PLAN






	(Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International
	Realty Fund and Realty Income Fund only)





	Each Multiclass Fund has adopted a Distribution Plan and related agreements (the
	Distribution Plan) pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, which provides that investment companies may pay distribution expenses, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a distribution plan adopted by the investment companys Board
	of Directors and approved by its shareholders. Under the Distribution Plan, each Fund will pay to the Distributor, as compensation for acting as principal underwriter of a Funds shares and as reimbursement of the distribution expenses incurred
	therewith, a fee at annual rates not to exceed 0.25%, 0.75% and 0.75% of the average net assets of each Fund attributable to Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C shares, respectively. The Distributor may use such amounts to pay various
	distribution-related expenses, including (i) to make payments to brokers, financial institutions and other financial intermediaries (payee(s)) who have rendered distribution assistance, (ii) to pay interest and other financing costs in the
	case of Class B shares and (iii) for other expenses such as advertising costs and the payment for printing and distribution of Prospectuses to prospective investors. The Class I shares do not participate in the Distribution Plan. In addition to
	the amounts required by the Distribution Plan, the Distributor may, in its discretion, pay additional amounts from its own resources. The Board of Directors has determined that there is a reasonable likelihood the Distribution Plan will benefit each
	Fund and its Class A and Class C shareholders. The expected benefits include greater sales (for Class A and Class C shares) and lower redemptions of class shares, which should allow each class to maintain a consistent cash flow.




	For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, with respect to the Class A shares, each Multiclass Fund paid
	distribution services fees for expenditures under the Distribution Plan in the following aggregate amounts, all of which constituted 0.25% of the Funds average daily net assets attributable to the Class A shares during the period. All of
	the following amounts paid were spent for compensation to broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries.

	Under the Distribution Plan, the Treasurer for each Multiclass Fund reports quarterly the amounts and purposes of
	assistance payments. During the continuance of the Distribution Plan the selection and nomination of the Independent Directors are at the discretion of the Independent Directors currently in office.




	The Distribution Plan may be terminated at any time by a vote of the shareholders or by vote of the Independent Directors. The Distribution Plan and related
	agreements may be renewed from year to year if approved by a vote of the majority of the Board of Directors, and by the vote of a majority of the Independent Directors cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such renewal. The
	Distribution Plan may not be amended to increase materially the amount to be spent for distribution without shareholder approval. All material amendments to the Distribution Plan must be approved by a vote of the Board of Directors and of the
	Independent Directors, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of such vote.




	Pursuant to the rules of the Financial Industry
	Regulatory Authority, the Distributor is required to limit aggregate initial sales charges, deferred sales charges and asset- based sales charges to 6.25% of total gross sales of each class of shares. Interest charges on unreimbursed distribution
	expenses equal to the prime rate plus one percent per annum may be added to the 6.25% limitation. Sales from the reinvestment of dividends and distributions are not included in the calculation of the 6.25% limitation. The annual asset-based sales
	charge on shares of a Fund may not exceed 0.75 of 1% per class. The 6.25% limitation applies to each class of a Multiclass Fund rather than on a per shareholder basis. If aggregate sales charges were to exceed 6.25% of total gross sales of any



	class, all sales charges on shares of that class would be suspended.





	DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE





	NAV per share (including each class of shares of a Multiclass Fund) is determined by each Fund on each day the NYSE is open for trading.




	For purposes of determining the NAV per share of each Fund , readily marketable portfolio securities principally traded on any exchange or similar regulated
	market reporting contemporaneous transaction prices are valued, except as indicated below, at the last sale price reflected on such principal market on the business day as of which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such
	day, the securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such day, or if no asked price is available, the bid price may be used. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day, then the security is valued by such method as
	the Board of Directors shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio securities traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of which such value is being determined
	as reflected on the tape at the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such securities.




	Readily marketable securities
	traded in the over-the-counter market, including listed securities whose primary market is believed by the Advisor to be over-the-counter, but excluding securities admitted to trading on the NASDAQ National List, are valued at the official closing
	prices as reported by NASDAQ or, in the case of securities not quoted by NASDAQ, the Pink Sheets or such other comparable source as the Board of Directors deem appropriate to reflect their fair market value. If there has been no sale on such day,
	the securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such day, or if no asked price is available, at the bid price. However, certain fixed-income securities may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service
	when such prices are believed by the Board of Directors to reflect the fair market value of such securities. The prices provided by a pricing service take into account institutional size trading in similar groups of securities and any developments
	related to specific securities.




	Securities for which market prices are unavailable will be valued at fair value pursuant to procedures
	approved by a Funds Board of Directors. Circumstances in which market prices may be unavailable include, but are not limited to, when trading in a security is suspended, the exchange on which the security is traded is subject to an unscheduled
	close or disruption or material events occur after the close of the exchange on which the security is principally traded. In these circumstances, a Fund determines fair value in a manner that fairly reflects the market value of the security on the
	valuation date based on consideration of any information or factors it deems appropriate. These may include recent transactions in comparable securities, information relating to the specific security and developments in the markets. In particular,
	portfolio securities primarily traded on foreign markets are generally valued at the preceding closing values of such securities on their respective exchanges or if after the close of the foreign markets, but prior to the close of trading on the
	NYSE on the day the securities are being valued, developments occur that are expected to materially affect the value of such securities, such values may be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of such securities as of the close of trading on
	the NYSE using a pricing service and/or procedures approved by a Funds Board of Directors.




	 




	39







	For purposes of determining a Funds NAV per share, all assets and liabilities initially expressed in
	foreign currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at the mean of the bid and asked prices of such currencies against the U.S. dollar last quoted by a major bank which is a regular participant in the institutional foreign exchange







	REDUCING THE INITIAL SALES LOAD ON CLASS A SHARES






	(Global Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund and Realty Income Fund only)





	As discussed in the Prospectus for Class A shares, the size of the total investment in the Class A shares of a Multiclass Fund will affect your sales load. Described below are several methods to
	reduce the applicable sales load. In order to obtain a reduction in the sales load, an investor must notify, at the time of purchase, his or her dealer, the Transfer Agent or the Distributor of the applicability of one of the following:





	Rights of Aggregation.

	The size of the total investment applies to the total amount being invested by any person, which
	term includes an individual, his or her spouse and children under the age of 21, a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing for a single trust, estate or single fiduciary account (including a pension, profit-sharing or other employee benefit trust
	created pursuant to a plan qualified under the Code) although more than one beneficiary is involved, or any U.S. bank or investment advisor purchasing shares for its investment advisory clients or customers. Any such person purchasing for several
	accounts at the same time may combine these investments into a single transaction in order to reduce the applicable sales charge.





	Rights
	of Accumulation.

	The Class A shares may be purchased at a reduced sales charge by a person (as defined above) who is already a shareholder of a Fund and/or a shareholder of other Cohen & Steers open-end funds that
	impose sales charges (Eligible Funds) by taking into account not only the amount then being invested, but also the current NAV of the shares of that Fund and other Eligible Funds already held by such person. If the current NAV of the
	qualifying shares already held plus the NAV of the current purchase exceeds a point in the schedule of sales charges at which the charge is reduced to a lower percentage, the entire current purchase is eligible for the reduced charge. To be entitled
	to a reduced sales charge pursuant to the Rights of Accumulation, the investor must notify his or her dealer, the Transfer Agent or the Distributor at the time of purchase that he or she wishes to take advantage of such entitlement, and give the
	numbers of his or her account, and those accounts held in the name of his or her spouse or for a minor child, and the specific relationship of each such other person to the investor.





	Letter of Intention.

	An investor may also qualify for a reduced sales charge by completing a Letter of Intention (the Letter) set forth in the Subscription Agreement in the Prospectus
	or on a separate form for this purpose which is available from the Fund. This enables the investor to aggregate purchases of shares of a Fund and other Eligible Funds during a 12-month period for purposes of calculating the applicable sales charge.
	All shares of a Fund and other Eligible Funds currently owned by the investor will be credited as purchases toward the completion of the Letter at the greater of their NAV on the date the Letter is executed or their cost. No retroactive adjustment
	will be made if purchases exceed the amount indicated in the Letter. For each investment made, the investor must notify his or her dealer, the Transfer Agent or the Distributor that a Letter is on file along with all account numbers associated with
	the Letter.




	The Letter is not a binding obligation on the investor. However, 5% of the amount specified in the Letter will be held in escrow,
	and if the investors purchases are less than the amount specified, the investor will be requested to remit to the Fund an amount equal to the difference between the sales charge paid and the sales charge applicable to the aggregate purchases
	actually made. If not remitted within 20 days after written request, an appropriate number of escrowed shares will be redeemed in order to realize the difference. However, the sales charge applicable to the investment will in no event be higher than
	if the shareholder had not submitted a Letter.





	Sales at Net Asset Value.

	Class A shares of a Fund may be sold at NAV without
	regard to investment amount (NAV Purchase) (i) to registered representatives or employees (and their immediate families) of authorized dealers, or to any trust, pension, profit-sharing or other benefit plan for only such persons,
	(ii) to banks or trust companies or their affiliates when the bank, trust company, or affiliate is authorized to make investment decisions on behalf of a client, (iii) to investment advisors and financial planners who place trades for
	their own accounts or the accounts of their clients and who charge a management, consulting or other fee for their services, (iv) to clients of such investment advisors and financial planners who place trades for their own accounts if the
	accounts are linked to the master account of such investment advisor or financial planner on the books and records of the broker, agent, investment advisor or financial institution, and (v) to retirement and deferred compensation plans and
	trusts used to fund those plans, including, but not limited to those defined in Section 401(a), 403(b) or 457 of the Code and rabbi trusts. Investors may be charged a fee if they effect transactions in Fund shares through a broker
	or agent. Class A shares of the Fund may also be sold at NAV to current officers, directors and employees (and their immediate families) of the Fund, the Advisor, Distributor employees (and their immediate families) of certain firms providing
	services to the Fund (such as the custodian and Transfer Agent), and to any trust, pension, profit-sharing or other benefit plan for only such persons.







	CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGES






	(Global
	Infrastructure Fund, Global Realty Shares, International Realty Fund and Realty Income Fund only)






	CLASS A SHARES





	With respect to purchases of $1,000,000 or more, Class A shares redeemed within one year of purchase will be subject to a contingent deferred sales
	charge equal to 1% of the lesser of the cost of the shares being redeemed or their NAV at the time of redemption. Accordingly, no sales charge will be imposed on increases in NAV above the initial purchase price. The contingent deferred sales charge
	on Class A shares will be waived on certain redemptions, as described below under Contingent Deferred Sales Charges Class B Shares. In addition, no charge will be assessed on shares derived from reinvestment of dividends or
	capital gains distributions. In determining the contingent deferred sales charge applicable to a redemption of Class A shares, it will be assumed that the redemption is, first, of any shares that are not subject to a contingent deferred sales
	charge (for example, because an initial sales charge was paid with respect to the shares, or they have been held beyond the period during which the charge applies or were acquired upon the reinvestment of dividends and distributions) and, second, of
	shares held longest during the time they are subject to the sales charge.




	 




	40







	Proceeds from the contingent deferred sales charge on Class A shares are paid to the Distributor and
	are used by the Distributor to defray expenses related to providing distribution-related services to a Fund in connection with the sales of Class A shares, such as the payment of compensation to selected dealers or financial intermediaries for
	selling Class A shares.





	CLASS B SHARES





	Class B shares that are redeemed within six years of purchase will be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge at the rates set forth in the Prospectus charged as a percentage of the dollar amount
	subject thereto. The charge will be assessed on an amount equal to the lesser of the cost of the shares being redeemed or their NAV at the time of redemption. Accordingly, no sales charge will be imposed on increases in NAV above the initial
	purchase price. In addition, no charge will be assessed on shares derived from reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions.




	Proceeds from the contingent deferred sales charge on the Class B shares are paid to the Distributor and are used by the Distributor to defray its expenses related to providing distribution-related services to a Fund in connection with past
	sales of the Class B shares, including payments to dealers and other financial intermediaries for sales of Class B shares and interest and other financing costs associated with the Class B shares.




	In determining the contingent deferred sales charge applicable to a redemption of Class B shares, it will be assumed that the redemption is, first, of any
	shares that were acquired upon the reinvestment of dividends or distributions and, second, of any shares held longest during the time they are subject to the sales charge. When shares acquired in an exchange are redeemed, the applicable contingent
	deferred sales charge and conversion schedules will be the schedules that applied at the time of the purchase of shares of the corresponding class of a Fund originally purchased by the shareholder.




	The contingent deferred sales charge is waived on redemptions of shares (i) following the death or disability, as defined in the
	Code, of a shareholder, (ii) to the extent that the redemption represents a minimum required distribution from an individual retirement account or other retirement plan to a shareholder who has attained the age of 70









	1



	/ 2 , or (iii) that had been purchased by present or former Directors of a Fund, by the relative of any such
	person, by any trust, individual retirement account or retirement plan account for the benefit of any such person or relative, or by the estate of any such person or relative.





	Conversion Feature.

	At the end of the month which precedes the eighth anniversary of the purchase date of a shareholders Class B shares, such Class B shares will automatically convert to
	Class A shares and will no longer be subject to higher distribution and service fees. Such conversion will occur on the basis of the relative NAVs of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee or other charge. The purpose of
	the conversion feature is to reduce the distribution and service fees paid by holders of Class B shares that have been outstanding long enough for the Distributor to have been compensated for distribution expenses incurred in the sale of such
	shares.




	For purposes of conversion to Class A, Class B shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and distributions paid in
	respect of Class B shares in a shareholders account will be considered to be held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares in the shareholders account (other than those in the sub-account) convert to Class A, an equal
	pro-rata portion of the Class B shares in the sub-account will also convert to Class A.





	CLASS C SHARES





	Class C shares that are redeemed within one year of purchase will be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge of 1%, charged as a percentage of the
	dollar amount subject thereto. The charge will be assessed on an amount equal to the lesser of the cost of the shares being redeemed or their NAV at the time of redemption. Accordingly, no sales charge will be imposed on increases in NAV above the
	initial purchase price. In addition, no charge will be assessed on shares derived from reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions. The contingent deferred sales charge on Class C shares will be waived on certain redemptions, as
	described above under Contingent Deferred Sales ChargesClass B Shares. In determining the contingent deferred sales charge applicable to a redemption of Class C shares, it will be assumed that the redemption is, first, of any
	shares that are not subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (for example, because the shares have been held beyond the period during which the charge applies or were acquired upon the reinvestment of dividends or distributions) and, second, of
	any shares held longest during the time they are subject to the sales charge.




	Proceeds from the contingent deferred sales charge are paid to
	the Distributor and are used by the Distributor to defray its expenses related to providing distribution-related services to the Fund in connection with the sale of the Class C shares, such as the payment of compensation to dealers and financial
	intermediaries for selling Class C shares.





	CLASS I SHARES





	Class I shares are not subject to a contingent deferred sales charge. Please see a Class I Prospectus for a further discussion of Class I shares.




	 




	41








	FUND REORGANIZATIONS





	Shares of a Fund may be issued without an initial sales charge in connection with the acquisition of cash and securities owned by other investment companies. Any contingent deferred sales charge or
	redemption fee will be waived in connection with the redemption of shares of a Fund if that Fund is combined with another Cohen & Steers mutual fund, or in connection with a similar reorganization transaction.





	SIGNATURE GUARANTEES





	In addition to the
	circumstances listed in the Prospectus, a Multiclass Fund requires signature guarantees for the following:




	1. When shares are
	transferred to a new owner.




	2. When certificated (issued) shares are redeemed, exchanged or transferred.




	3. To establish any ACH service or to amend banking information on an existing ACH service. *




	4. When the authority of a representative of a corporation, partnership, trust, or other entity has not been satisfactorily established prior to the transaction request.




	5. When an address is updated on an account which has been coded Do Not Mail because mail has been returned as undeliverable. A mailing address
	and residential address must be provided. *

	of prudence.




	Each Fund reserves the right to require that instructions for any other transactions be in writing, signed by all owners,
	and signature guaranteed.




	A Fund will accept a signature guarantee from its principal underwriter, or any eligible guarantor institution
	(including any bank, savings association, credit union, exchange, or broker firm) that is a member of the STAMP, the New York Exchange Medallion Signature Program (MSP), or the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program (SEMP). The surety bond coverage
	amount of the guarantee must equal or exceed the amount of the transaction or transactions that are being authorized. If more than one signature is required, each signature must be signature guaranteed. A Fund will not accept a signature guarantee
	that has been amended or limited in any way. Please note that a notary public stamp or seal is not an acceptable substitute for a signature guarantee.




	The signature guarantee requirements do not apply to transactions or instructions that are communicated to a Fund through NSCC Fund/SERV or Networking by broker-dealers or other financial institutions that have entered into a Fund/SERV or
	Networking Agreement with a Fund or a Funds agent. Broker-dealers and other institutions that process transactions through Fund/SERV or Networking are responsible for obtaining the permission of their clients to process such transactions and
	for ensuring that such transactions are processed properly. A Fund does not have any responsibility for obtaining any documentation from such financial institutions to demonstrate that their clients have authorized the transactions or instructions.




	The signature guarantee policies of the Funds may be amended at any time without prior notice.

	For items 3 and 5, a Signature Validation Program stamp (SVP) will be accepted from any member of the Securities Transfer Agent Medallion Signature Program
	(STAMP) in lieu of a medallion signature guarantee. When using SVP to change banking instructions, a shareholder must wait 30 days from the date of the change before redeeming shares to the newly updated bank file; however, using a STAMP 2000
	Medallion signature guarantee will not cause such a delay.









	OTHER INFORMATION





	The Advisor and the Distributor may make payments from their own resources to dealers and other financial intermediaries as compensation for
	distribution, administrative or other services (Additional Payments). In the case of Multiclass Funds, these Additional Payments are in addition to the compensation these intermediaries receive from sales commissions, 12b-1 fees and
	shareholder service fees, as described in the Prospectuses of the Multiclass Funds. With respect to all Funds, these Additional Payments may take the form of, among other things, due diligence payments for an intermediarys
	examination of a Fund and payments for providing extra employee training and information relating to a Fund; listing fees for the placement of a Fund on an intermediarys list of mutual funds available for purchase by its customers;
	marketing support fees for providing assistance in promoting the sale of a Funds shares; payments for the sale of shares and/or the maintenance of share balances; and fees for subaccounting, administrative and/or shareholder
	processing services that are in addition to the shareholder servicing fees paid by a Fund. The Additional Payments may be a fixed dollar amount, may be based on the number of customer accounts maintained by a dealer, or may be based on a percentage
	of the value of shares sold to, or held by, customers of the intermediary. The Advisor and Distributor may from time to time pay additional cash or non-cash incentives to intermediaries in connection with the sale of shares of a Fund, subject to
	applicable Financial Industry Regulatory Authority rules. Such additional amounts may be utilized, in whole or in part, in some cases together with other revenues of such dealers, to provide additional compensation to registered representatives who
	sell shares of a Fund. On some occasions, such cash or non-cash incentives may be offered only to certain dealers who have sold or may sell significant amounts of shares. Such incentives may include payment for attendance at seminars or payment for
	occasional meals, sporting events, theater performances or comparable entertainment. Such dealers may elect to receive cash incentives of equivalent amount in lieu of such payments.

	TAXATION





	Set forth below is a discussion of certain U.S. Federal income tax issues concerning each Fund and the purchase, ownership and disposition of Fund shares.
	This discussion does not purport to be complete or to deal with all aspects of federal income taxation that may be relevant to shareholders in light of their particular circumstances. This discussion is based upon present provisions of the Code, the
	regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative ruling authorities, all of which are subject to change, which change may be retroactive. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax
	consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of Fund shares, as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, foreign country, or other taxing jurisdiction.





	TAXATION OF THE FUND





	Each Fund has elected
	to be treated as, and intends to qualify annually as, a regulated investment company under the Code. To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally accorded to a regulated investment company, a Fund must, among other
	things, (i) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from: (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign
	currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures and forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or foreign currencies; and (b) net income derived from
	interests in certain publicly traded partnerships that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that derive less than 90% of their gross income from the items described in (a) above (each a Qualified Publicly
	Traded Partnership); and (ii) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year; (a) at least 50% of the value of a Funds total assets is represented by (I) cash and cash items, U.S.
	government securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies and (II) other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of a Funds total assets
	and not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and (b) not more than 25% of the value of a Funds total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities and the securities of other
	regulated investment companies) of (I) any one issuer, (II) any two or more issuers that the Fund controls and that are determined to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses or (III) any one or
	more Qualified Publicly Traded Partnerships.




	As a regulated investment company, a Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income
	tax on its investment company taxable income (which includes among other items, dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, but determined without regard to the deduction for dividend paid) and net
	capital gains (the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses), if any, that it distributes to shareholders, provided that it distributes at least 90% of its investment company taxable income for such taxable year. Each
	Fund intends to distribute to its shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gains. Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution
	requirement, described below, are subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax. To prevent imposition of the excise tax, a Fund must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of its ordinary income (not
	taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year, (2) 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending on December 31, as elected by that
	Fund, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for previous years that was not distributed during those years.




	If for any
	taxable year a Fund does not qualify as a regulated investment company or satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, all of its taxable income (including its net capital gain) will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates
	without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of that Funds current and accumulated earnings and profits.





	DISTRIBUTIONS





	Dividends paid out of a
	Funds current and accumulated earnings and profits will, except in the case of distributions of qualified dividend income and capital gain dividends described below, be taxable to a U.S. shareholder as ordinary income to the extent of that
	Funds earnings and profits. For taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2010, qualified dividend income received by individual shareholders is taxed at rates equivalent to long-term capital gain tax rates, which reach a maximum
	of 15%. Qualified dividend income generally includes dividends from domestic corporations and dividends from qualified foreign corporations. Dividends paid by U.S. REITs will not generally be eligible to qualify as qualified dividend
	income. A foreign corporation is a qualified foreign corporation if it is (1) incorporated in a possession of the United States or is eligible for benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the United
	States Treasury Department determines is satisfactory for this purpose and that includes an exchange of information program or (2) any other foreign corporation with respect to any dividend paid by such corporation if the stock with respect to
	which such dividend is paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. A qualified foreign corporation does not include any foreign corporation, which for the taxable year of the corporation in which
	the dividend was paid, or the preceding taxable year, is a passive foreign investment company. A Fund generally can pass the tax treatment of qualified dividend income it receives through to Fund shareholders. For a Fund to receive qualified
	dividend income, that Fund must meet certain holding period requirements for the stock on which the otherwise qualified dividend is paid. In addition, the Fund cannot be obligated to make payments (pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) with respect
	to substantially similar or related property. The same provisions, including the holding period requirements, apply to each shareholders investment in that Fund. The provisions of the Code applicable to qualified dividend income and the 15%
	maximum individual tax rate on long-term capital gains are currently effective through 2010. Thereafter, qualified dividend income will no longer be taxed at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains, and the maximum individual tax rate on
	long-term capital gains will increase to 20%, unless Congress enacts legislation providing otherwise. Because of the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, a Fund cannot predict at this time what portion, if any, of the dividends it will receive from
	foreign corporations will be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation applicable to qualified dividend income, nor can there be any assurance as to what portion, if any, of that Funds distributions will be entitled to the lower tax rates
	that apply to qualified dividend income.




	 




	43







	Distributions of net capital gain, if any, designated as capital gain dividends are taxable to a shareholder
	as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long the shareholder has held Fund shares. Long-term capital gain rates for individuals have been temporarily reduced to 15% (with lower rates for individuals in the 10% and 15% rate brackets) for
	taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2010.




	A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the current
	calendar year if it is declared by a Fund in October, November or December with a record date in such a month and paid by that Fund during January of the following calendar year. Such distributions will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar
	year in which the distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received. To prevent application of the excise tax, the Funds intend to make its distributions in accordance with the calendar year
	distribution requirement.




	A distribution of an amount in excess of a Funds current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated
	by a shareholder as a return of capital which is applied against and reduces the shareholders basis in his or her shares. To the extent that the amount of any such distribution exceeds the shareholders basis in his or her shares, the
	excess will be treated by the shareholder as gain from a sale or exchange of the shares.




	Dividends designated by a Fund and received by
	corporate shareholders of that Fund will qualify for the dividends received deduction (the DRD) to the extent of the amount of qualifying dividends received by that Fund from domestic corporations (other than REITs) for the taxable year.
	A dividend received by a Fund will not be treated as a qualifying dividend (i) if the stock on which the dividend is paid is considered to be debt-financed (generally, acquired with borrowed funds), (ii) if a Fund fails to meet
	certain holding period requirements for the stock on which the dividend is paid or (iii) to the extent that a Fund is under an obligation (pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in
	substantially similar or related property. Moreover, the DRD may be disallowed or reduced if the corporate shareholder fails to satisfy the foregoing requirements with respect to its shares of a Fund or by application of the Code.




	Distributions will be treated in the manner described above regardless of whether such distributions are paid in cash or invested in additional shares of a
	Fund.




	A Fund may elect to retain its net capital gain or a portion thereof for investment and be taxed at corporate rates on the amount
	retained. In such case, it may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who will be treated as if each received a distribution of his or her pro rata share of such gain, with the result that each
	shareholder will (i) be required to report his or her pro rata share of such gain on his or her tax return as long-term capital gain, (ii) receive a refundable tax credit for his or her pro rata share of tax paid by that Fund on the gain
	and (iii) increase the tax basis for his or her shares by an amount equal to the deemed distribution less the tax credit.




	Shareholders
	will be notified annually as to the U.S. federal tax status of distributions.





	SALE OR EXCHANGE OF FUND SHARES





	Upon the sale or other disposition of shares of a Fund which a shareholder holds as a capital asset, including an exchange of shares in a Fund for shares of
	another Fund or another Cohen & Steers fund, such shareholder may realize a capital gain or loss which will be long-term or short-term, depending upon the shareholders holding period for the shares. A shareholder who exchanges shares
	in a Fund for shares of another Fund or another Cohen & Steers fund will have a tax basis in the newly- acquired fund shares equal to the amount invested and will begin a new holding period for federal income tax purposes.




	If a shareholder exchanges shares in a Fund held for 90 days or less for shares in another Fund or another Cohen & Steers Fund pursuant to a
	reinvestment right, the sales charge incurred in the purchase of the Fund shares exchanged may not be added to the tax basis in determining gain or loss for federal income tax purposes to the extent an otherwise applicable sales charge on the
	purchase of the newly-acquired shares is reduced pursuant to the reinvestment right. Instead, the sales charge for the exchanged Fund shares shall be added to the cost basis of the newly-acquired shares for purposes of determining gain or loss on
	the disposition of such newly-acquired Fund shares, if such newly-acquired Fund shares are not disposed of in a similar exchange transaction within 90 days. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed
	of are replaced (including through reinvestment of dividends) with substantially similar shares within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired
	will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on a disposition of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions of net
	capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such shares.




	If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to shares of $2
	million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) a disclosure statement on Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio
	securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a regulated investment company are not excepted. Future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to
	shareholders of most or all regulated investment companies. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayers treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should
	consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.





	NATURE OF
	FUNDS INVESTMENTS





	Certain of a Funds investment practices are subject to special and complex federal income tax provisions
	that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income,
	(iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause a Fund to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to
	when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (vii) produce income that will not qualify as good income under the 90% annual gross
	income test described above. Each Fund will monitor its transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the effect of these provisions.

	ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT SECURITIES





	Investments by a Fund in zero coupon or other discount securities will result in income to that Fund equal to a portion of the excess of the face value of the securities over their issue price (the
	original issue discount) each year that the securities are held, even though the Fund receives no cash interest payments. This income is included in determining the amount of income which a Fund must distribute to maintain its status as
	a regulated investment company and to avoid the payment of federal income tax and the 4% excise tax. In addition, if a Fund invests in certain high yield original issue discount securities issued by corporations, a portion of the original issue
	discount accruing on any such obligation may be eligible for the deduction for dividends received by corporations. In such event, dividends of investment company taxable income received from that Fund by its corporate shareholders, to the extent
	attributable to such portion of accrued original issue discount, may be eligible for this deduction for dividends received by corporations if so designated by the Fund in a written notice to shareholders. Because such income may not be matched by a
	corresponding cash distribution to that Fund, the Fund may be required to borrow money or dispose of other securities to be able to make distributions to its shareholders.





	MARKET DISCOUNT BONDS





	Gains derived by a Fund from the disposition of any market discount
	bonds (i.e., bonds purchased other than at original issue, where the face value of the bonds exceeds their purchase price) held by that Fund will be taxed as ordinary income to the extent of the accrued market discount of the bonds, unless the Fund
	elects to include the market discount in income as it accrues.





	OPTIONS AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS





	The taxation of equity options and over-the- counter options on debt securities is governed by Section 1234 of the Code. Pursuant to Section 1234
	of the Code, the premium received by a Fund for selling a put or call option is not included in income at the time of receipt. If the option expires, the premium is short-term capital gain to that Fund. If a Fund enters into a closing transaction,
	the difference between the premium received and the amount paid to close out its position is short-term capital gain or loss. If a call option written by a Fund is exercised, thereby requiring that Fund to sell the underlying security, the premium
	will increase the amount realized upon the sale of such security, and any resulting gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term or short-term depending upon the holding period of the security. With respect to a put or call option
	that is purchased by a Fund, if the option is sold, any resulting gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss, and will be long-term or short-term, depending upon the holding period of the option. If the option expires, the resulting loss is a
	capital loss and is long- term or short-term depending upon the holding period of the option. If the option is exercised, the cost of the option, in the case of a call option, is added to the basis of the purchased security and, in the case of a put
	option, reduces the amount realized on the underlying security in determining gain or loss.




	Certain options, futures contracts and forward
	contracts in which a Fund may invest are Section 1256 contracts governed by Section 1256 of the Code. Gains or losses on Section 1256 contracts generally are considered 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gains or losses;
	however, foreign currency gains or losses (as discussed below) arising from certain Section 1256 contracts may be treated as ordinary income or loss. Also, Section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of each taxable year (and,
	generally, for purposes of the 4% excise tax, on December 31, as elected by that Fund) are marked-to- market (that is, treated as sold at fair market value), resulting in unrealized gains or losses being treated as though they were
	realized.




	Generally, the hedging transactions undertaken by a Fund may result in straddles for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
	The straddle rules may affect the character of gains (or losses) realized by a Fund. In addition, losses realized by a Fund on positions that are part of a straddle may be deferred under the straddle rules, rather than being taken into account in
	calculating the taxable income for the taxable year in which the losses are realized. Because only a few regulations implementing the straddle rules have been promulgated, the tax consequences to a Fund of engaging in hedging transactions are not
	entirely clear. Hedging transactions may increase the amount of short-term capital gain realized by a Fund which is taxed as ordinary income when distributed to shareholders. A Fund may make one or more of the elections available under the Code
	which are applicable to straddles. If a Fund makes any of the elections, the amount, character and timing of the recognition of gains or losses from the affected straddle positions will be determined under rules that vary according to the
	election(s) made. The rules applicable under certain of the elections may operate to accelerate the recognition of gains or losses from the affected straddle positions.




	Because the straddle rules may affect the character of gains or losses, defer losses and/or accelerate the recognition of gains or losses from the affected straddle positions, the amount which may be
	distributed to shareholders, and which will be taxed to them as ordinary income or long-term capital gain, may be increased or decreased as compared to a fund that did not engage in such hedging transactions.




	Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, a Fund may recognize gain (but not loss) from a constructive sale of certain appreciated
	financial positions if that Fund enters into a short sale, offsetting notional principal contract, or futures or forward contract transaction with respect to the appreciated position or substantially identical property. Appreciated financial
	positions subject to this constructive sale treatment are interests (including options, futures and forward contracts and short sales) in stock, partnership interests, certain actively traded trust instruments and certain debt instruments.
	Constructive sale treatment does not apply to certain transactions closed prior to the end of the 30



	th



	day after the close of the taxable year, if certain conditions are met.

	INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES OF UNCERTAIN TAX CHARACTER





	A Fund may invest in preferred securities or other securities the U.S. federal income tax treatment of which may not be clear or may be subject to
	recharacterization by the IRS. To the extent the tax treatment of such securities or the income from such securities differs from the tax treatment expected by a Fund, it could affect the timing or character of income recognized by that Fund,
	requiring the Fund to purchase or sell securities, or otherwise change its portfolio, in order to comply with the tax rules applicable to regulated investment companies under the Code.





	INVESTMENT IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES





	Investment income that may be received by a Fund from
	sources within foreign countries may be subject to foreign taxes withheld at the source. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries, which entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of, or exemption from, taxes on such income.
	If more than 50% of the value of a Funds total assets at the close of the taxable year consists of stock or securities of foreign corporations, that Fund may elect to pass through to its shareholders the amount of foreign taxes
	paid by that Fund. If a Fund so elects, each shareholder would be required to include in gross income, even though not actually received, his or her pro rata share of the foreign taxes paid by that Fund, but would be treated as having paid his or
	her pro rata share of such foreign taxes and would therefore be allowed to either deduct such amount in computing taxable income or use such amount (subject to various Code limitations) as a foreign tax credit against federal income tax (but not
	both). For purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation rules of the Code, each shareholder would treat as foreign source income his or her pro rata share of such foreign taxes plus the portion of dividends received from that Fund representing
	income derived from foreign sources. No deduction for foreign taxes could be claimed by an individual shareholder who does not itemize deductions. In certain circumstances, a shareholder that (i) has held shares of a Fund for less than a
	specified minimum period during which it is not protected from risk of loss or (ii) is obligated to make payments related to the dividends will not be allowed a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes deemed imposed on dividends paid on such
	shares. Additionally, a Fund must also meet this holding period requirement with respect to its foreign stocks and securities in order for creditable taxes to flow-through. Each shareholder should consult his or her own tax adviser
	regarding the potential application of foreign tax credits.





	FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS





	Under Section 988 of the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or
	expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time that Fund actually collects such income or receivables or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, gains or losses on foreign
	currency forward contracts and the disposition of debt securities denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or
	loss.





	INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS





	A Fund may invest in U.S. REITs that hold residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) or which are, or have certain wholly-owned subsidiaries that are taxable
	mortgage pools. Under a Notice issued by the IRS, the Code and Treasury regulations to be issued, a portion of a Funds income from a U.S. REIT that is attributable to the REITs residual interest in a REMIC or, possibly, equity
	interests in a taxable mortgage pool (referred to in the Code as an excess inclusion) will be subject to federal income tax in all events. These regulations are also expected to provide that excess inclusion income of a regulated
	investment company, such as a Fund, will be allocated to shareholders of the regulated investment company in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders, with the same consequences as if the shareholders held the related REMIC residual
	interest or, if applicable, taxable mortgage pool directly. In general, excess inclusion income allocated to shareholders (i) cannot be offset by net operating losses (subject to a limited exception for certain thrift institutions),
	(ii) will constitute unrelated business taxable income to entities (including a qualified pension plan, an individual retirement account, a 401(k) plan, a Keogh plan or other tax-exempt entity) subject to tax on unrelated business income,
	thereby potentially requiring such an entity that is allocated excess inclusion income, and otherwise might not be required to file a tax return, to file a tax return and pay tax on such income, and (iii) in the case of a foreign shareholder,
	will not qualify for any reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax. In addition, if at any time during any taxable year a disqualified organization (as defined in the Code) is a record holder of a share in a regulated investment company,
	then the regulated investment company will be subject to a tax equal to that portion of its excess inclusion income for the taxable year that is allocable to the disqualified organization, multiplied by the highest federal income tax rate imposed on
	corporations. The Notice imposes certain reporting requirements upon regulated investment companies that have excess inclusion income. The Advisor does not intend to invest a substantial portion of any Funds assets in U.S. REITs which generate
	excess inclusion income.





	PASSIVE FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANIES





	A Fund may invest in shares of foreign corporations that may be classified under the Code as passive foreign investment companies (PFICs). In general, a foreign corporation is classified as a
	PFIC if at least one-half of the average value of its assets held during the taxable year constitute investment-type assets, or 75% or more of its gross income is investment-type income. If a Fund receives a so-called excess distribution
	with respect to PFIC stock, that Fund itself may be subject to a tax on a portion of the excess distribution, whether or not the corresponding income is distributed by the Fund to shareholders. In general, under the PFIC rules, an excess
	distribution is treated as having been realized ratably over the period during which a Fund held the PFIC shares. A Fund will itself be subject to tax on the portion, if any, of an excess distribution that is so allocated to prior Fund taxable years
	and an interest factor will be added to the tax, as if the tax had been payable in such prior taxable years. Certain distributions from a PFIC as well as gain from the sale of PFIC shares are treated as excess distributions. Excess distributions are
	characterized as ordinary income even though, absent application of the PFIC rules, certain excess distributions might have been classified as capital gain.




	 




	46







	A Fund may be eligible to elect alternative tax treatment with respect to PFIC shares. Under an election
	that currently is available in some circumstances, a Fund would be required to include in its gross income its share of the earnings of a PFIC on a current basis, regardless of whether distributions were received from the PFIC in a given year. If
	this election were made, the special rules, discussed above, relating to the taxation of excess distributions, would not apply. In addition, another election would involve marking to market a Funds PFIC shares at the end of each taxable year,
	with the result that unrealized gains would be treated as though they were realized and reported as ordinary income. Any marked-to-market losses and any loss from an actual disposition of PFIC shares would be deductible as ordinary losses to the
	extent of any net marked-to-market gains included in income in prior years.




	Under either election, a Fund might be required to recognize in a
	year income in excess of its distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income would nevertheless be included in determining the amount of income which the Fund must distribute to maintain
	its status as a regulated investment company and to avoid the payment of federal income tax and the 4% excise tax.




	Dividends from a PFIC and
	certain other foreign corporations are not eligible for treatment as qualified dividend income. See Distributions above for a discussion regarding the taxation of qualified dividend income.




	Certain other anti-deferral rules could apply to the extent a Fund owes 10% or more of the voting powers of the voting stock of a
	controlled foreign corporation.





	BACKUP WITHHOLDING





	A Fund may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax on all taxable distributions payable to shareholders who fail to provide that Fund with their correct taxpayer identification number or to make
	required certifications, or who have been notified by the IRS that they are subject to backup withholding. Corporate shareholders and certain other shareholders specified in the Code generally are exempt from such backup withholding. Backup
	withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld may be credited against the shareholders U.S. federal income tax liability.





	FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS





	U.S. taxation of income from a Fund to a shareholder who, as to the United States, is a nonresident alien
	individual, a foreign trust or estate, a foreign corporation or foreign partnership (foreign shareholder) depends on whether the income of that Fund is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the
	shareholder.





	Income Not Effectively Connected

	. If the income from a Fund is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade
	or business carried on by the foreign shareholder, distributions of investment company taxable income will generally be subject to a U.S. tax of 30% (or lower treaty rate, except in the case of any excess inclusion income allocated to the
	shareholder (see TaxationInvestments in Real Estate Investment Trusts, above)), which tax is generally withheld from such distributions. Capital gain dividends and any amounts retained by a Fund which are designated as
	undistributed capital gains will not be subject to U.S. tax at the rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate) unless the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual and is physically present in the United States for more than 182 days during the
	taxable year and meets certain other requirements. However, this 30% tax on capital gains of nonresident alien individuals who are physically present in the United States for more than the 182-day period only applies in exceptional cases because any
	individual present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year is generally treated as a resident for U.S. income tax purposes; in that case, he or she would be subject to U.S. income tax on his or her worldwide income at the
	graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, rather than the 30% U.S. withholding tax. In the case of a foreign shareholder who is a nonresident alien individual, a Fund may be required to withhold U.S. income tax on distributions of net capital
	gains unless the foreign shareholder certifies his or her non-U.S. status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption (generally by providing an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN).




	If a Fund is a U.S. real property holding corporation, or would be but for the operation of certain exclusions, distributions by the Fund
	attributable to gains from U.S. real property interests realized on account of certain capital gain dividends from U.S. REITs, will generally cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing such gain as income effectively
	connected to a trade or business within the United States (subject to the rules described below for effectively connected income). Generally, a Fund is required to withhold at a 35% rate on a distribution to a foreign shareholder attributable to
	such gains from U.S. real property interests, and such a distribution may subject a foreign shareholder to a U.S. tax filing obligation and may create a branch profits tax liability for foreign corporate shareholders. Under a de minimis exception to
	the rule described above, if a foreign shareholder has not held more than 5% of a Funds shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution, the foreign shareholder is not treated as receiving a distribution
	attributable to gains from U.S. real property interests, but is, instead, treated as receiving an ordinary distribution subject to U.S. tax at the rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate).




	 




	47







	Any gain that a foreign shareholder realizes upon the sale or exchange of such shareholders shares of
	a Fund will ordinarily be exempt from U.S. tax unless (i) in the case of a shareholder that is a nonresident alien individual, the gain is U.S. source income and such shareholder is physically present in the United States for more than 182 days
	during the taxable year and meets certain other requirements, or (ii) at any time during the shorter of the period during which the foreign shareholder held shares of the Fund and the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition of
	those shares, the Fund was a U.S. real property holding corporation and the foreign shareholder actually or constructively held more than 5% of the shares of the Fund, in which event described in (ii) at any time during the shorter
	of the period during which the foreign shareholder held such shares of the Fund and the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition of those shares, the Fund was a U.S. real property holding corporation and the foreign shareholder
	actually or constructively held more than 5% of the Funds shares. In the latter event, the gain would be taxed in the same manner as for a U.S. shareholder, as discussed above. A corporation is a U.S. real property holding
	corporation if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the fair market value of such interests plus its interests in real property located outside the United States plus any other assets used or held
	for use in a business. In the case of a Fund, U.S. real property interests include interests in stock in U.S. real property holding corporations (other than stock of a REIT controlled by U.S. persons and holdings of 5% or less in the stock of
	publicly traded U.S. real property holding corporations) and certain participating debt securities.




	Foreign shareholders that engage in
	certain wash sale and/or substitute dividend payment transactions the effect of which is to avoid the receipt of distributions from the Fund that would be treated as gain effectively connected with a United States trade or business will
	be treated as having received such distributions. All shareholders of a Fund should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rule.





	Income Effectively Connected

	. If the income from a Fund is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business carried on by a foreign shareholder, then distributions of investment
	company taxable income and capital gain dividends, any amounts retained by the Fund which are designated as undistributed capital gains and any gains realized upon the sale or exchange of shares of the Fund will be subject to U.S. income tax at the
	graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, residents and domestic corporations. Foreign corporate shareholders may also be subject to the branch profits tax imposed by the Code.




	The tax consequences to a foreign shareholder entitled to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may differ from those described herein.




	Foreign shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.





	OTHER TAXATION





	Fund
	shareholders may be subject to state, local and foreign taxes on their Fund distributions. Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.

	Indemnification










	It is the Registrants policy to indemnify its directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by Section 2-418 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland as set forth in
	Article EIGHTH of Registrants Articles of Incorporation, filed as Exhibit (a), and Article VIII, Section 1, of the Registrants By-Laws, filed as Exhibit (b). The liability of the Registrants directors and officers is dealt
	with in Article EIGHTH of Registrants Articles of Incorporation and Article VIII, Section 1 through Section 6, of the Registrants By-Laws. The liability of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Registrants
	investment advisor (the Advisor), for any loss suffered by the Registrant or its shareholders is set forth in Section 4 of the Management Agreement, filed as Exhibit (d) to this Registration Statement. The liability of
	Cohen & Steers Securities, LLC, the Registrants distributor, for any loss suffered by the Registrant or its shareholders is set forth in Section 8 of the Distribution Agreement filed as Exhibit (e) to this Registration
	Statement.




	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
	Act), may be permitted to the directors and officers, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in such Act and is therefore
	unenforceable. If a claim for indemnification against such liabilities under the Securities Act (other than for expenses incurred in a successful defense) is asserted against the Registrant by the directors or officers in connection with the
	Registrants shares, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	Overview and Scope





	The Cohen & Steers Code of Ethics (the Code) applies to Cohen & Steers, Inc. as well as any of its current or future subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively,
	Cohen & Steers) and the Cohen & Steers U.S. registered investment companies and the provisions of this Code apply to all Cohen & Steers employees, wherever located. In certain non-U.S. countries, local laws or
	customs may impose requirements in addition to the Code. This Code does not apply to directors of Cohen & Steers who are not also Cohen & Steers employees but sections of this Code do apply to the independent directors of the
	Cohen & Steers U.S. registered investment companies.




	The Code is structured as follows:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Section I contains a statement of general fiduciary principles






	 





	 




	




	 





	Section II defines certain terms used in the Code






	 





	 




	




	 





	Section III describes the preclearance requirements for personal securities transactions, among other things






	 





	 




	




	 





	Section IV details the limitations and restrictions imposed by the Code






	 





	 




	




	 





	Section V describes the reporting requirements under the Code






	 





	 




	




	 





	Section VI details the administration and procedural requirements of the Code






	 






	I.






	Statement of General Fiduciary Principles







	The following general fiduciary principles shall govern personal investment activities and the interpretation and administration of this Code:



	 





	 




	




	 





	The interests of clients must be placed first at all times;






	 





	 




	




	 





	All personal securities transactions must be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Code and in a way to avoid any actual or potential
	conflict of interest or any abuse of an individuals position of trust and responsibility;






	 





	 




	




	 





	Individuals must not take advantage of their own positions at Cohen & Steers to misappropriate investment opportunities from clients; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	Individuals must comply with the applicable federal securities laws.



	1










	When making personal investment decisions, all employees must exercise extreme care to avoid violating the prohibitions of this Code. Furthermore, employees should conduct



	 








	1







	For purposes of this Code, applicable federal securities laws is defined as the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act), the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, any rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the SEC) under any of these statutes, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 as it applies to funds and investment advisors, any rules adopted thereunder by the SEC or the Department of the Treasury, and any applicable local legislation,
	including the rules and regulations of the Belgian Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission, the rules and regulations of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority and the rules and regulations of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures
	Commission.

	their personal investing in such a manner that will minimize the employees time and attention that are
	devoted to personal investments at the expense of time and attention that should be devoted to duties at Cohen & Steers.




	It is not
	possible for this policy to address every situation involving Cohen & Steers employees personal trading. The Chief Compliance Officer in consultation with the Cohen & Steers Executive Committee is charged with oversight and
	interpretation of this Code in a manner considered fair and equitable, with a view in all cases of placing Cohen & Steers clients interests first.

	Technical compliance with the Code will not insulate an employee from scrutiny of, or
	sanctions for, employee abuses of his or her position, fiduciary duty or securities transactions which may potentially conflict with any client of Cohen & Steers.

	




	 





	Trades in an account where investment discretion is delegated to an independent third party (see Managed Accounts below).






	 





	 




	C.





	Managed Accounts







	Transactions in personal accounts for which an Access Person does not have direct or indirect influence or control (e.g. a professionally managed account over which the Access Person has authorized complete discretion) are not subject to
	the preclearance requirements of the Code. If an Access Person has beneficial interest in an account but does not have direct or indirect influence or control, the Access Person must provide compliance with written confirmation of the Access
	Persons lack of direct or indirect influence or control over the account. Upon approval from the CCO, transactions in such account will not require preclearance and need not be reported under Section V below



	 






	IV.






	Restrictions







	Preclearance requests will be denied under the circumstances described below. Please note that the following restrictions are equally applied to the Covered Security and to instruments related to the Covered Security. A related instrument
	is any security or instrument issued by the same entity as the issuer of the Covered Security, including options, rights, warrants, preferred stock, bonds and other obligations of that issuer, instruments otherwise convertible into securities of
	that issuer or any other instrument derived from a Covered security (e.g. OTC options) regardless of issuer.



	 





	 




	A.





	Blackout Periods






	 





	 





	1.






	Real Estate Securities







	No Access Person shall purchase or sell any Real Estate Security (as defined in Section II ) except that an Access Person may invest in shares of open-end funds, closed-end funds and ETFs that invest in Real Estate Securities, subject to
	the applicable preclearance and reporting requirements of this Code.




	 




	5









	 





	2.






	Non-Real Estate Securities






	 





	 




	a.




	No Access Person shall execute any securities transaction on a day during which any client has a pending buy or sell order in that same security unless clearance was
	granted prior to the initiation of the order or until that order is executed or withdrawn.





	 





	 




	b.




	Investment Personnel are prohibited from trading a security in a personal account for three days before and one day after a transaction in the same or equivalent
	security in a client portfolio they manage.





	 





	 




	B.





	Holding Period







	All
	Access Persons are prohibited from profiting from the purchase and sale or the sale and purchase of the same security (or equivalent) within thirty (30) calendar days. Any profits realized from the purchase and sale or the sale and purchase of
	the same security (or equivalent) within thirty day restriction periods shall be disgorged. Transactions that would result in a loss are not subject to the 30-day holding period.




	The holding period is calculated using FIFO (first-in-first out) and therefore the holding period rule is violated if there is a profit when:



	 





	 




	




	 





	The first purchase(s) during the timeframe are followed by a sale at a higher price, or






	 





	 




	




	 





	The first sale(s) during the timeframe are followed by a purchase at a lower price







	The price is calculated by looking at the price of the earliest opposite-side transactions during the thirty day period.





	FIFO Example:






	If an employee purchased 100 shares of XYZ on March 1 and 100 more on March 15, on April 1 the employee would be permitted to sell at a profit only 100 shares. She/he would have to wait until April 15 to sell the
	additional 100 shares at a profit.





	Certain limited exceptions to this holding period are available on a case-by-case basis
	and must be approved by the Chief Compliance Officer or a designee prior to execution. Exceptions to this policy include, but are not limited to, hardships and extended disability. Non-volitional trades such as automatic investment and withdrawal
	programs and automatic rebalancing are permitted transactions under this policy.




	 




	6







	Officers and directors of the Cohen & Steers closed-end funds are subject to
	additional holding periods as set forth in Section IV.B.F below and the Cohen & Steers Inside Information Policy.



	 





	 




	C.





	Excessive Trading







	Excessive or inappropriate trading is prohibited. The Compliance Department monitors all employees trading and provides periodic reports to department heads and supervisors regarding the volume and nature of employee transactions. A
	pattern of excessive trading may lead to disciplinary action under the Code up to and including termination.



	 





	 




	D.





	Initial Public Offerings







	All Access Persons are prohibited from purchasing equity securities in an initial public offering.



	 





	 




	E.





	Private Placements







	Access Persons must obtain prior approval from the CCO before directly or indirectly acquiring Beneficial Ownership in a Private Placement. The CCO will consult a member of the executive committee and other appropriate parties in evaluating
	the request. To request prior approval, Access Persons must provide the CCO with a completed Private Placement Approval Request (Appendix B) and sufficient supporting documentation.




	If the request is approved, the Access Person must report the trade on the Quarterly Transaction Report and report the investment on the
	Annual Holdings report (see Section V). Subsequent investments in same Private Placement must also be preapproved and reported.



	 





	 




	F.





	Cohen & Steers Closed-End Funds







	Additional restrictions regarding the closed-end funds managed by Cohen & Steers, in order to ensure no improper trading takes place, include:



	 





	 




	1.





	Holding Period: Directors and officers of the Cohen & Steers closed-end Funds are prohibited by the federal securities laws from selling
	shares of these Funds within six months of purchasing them, or purchasing shares of these Funds within six months of selling them, and must file forms promptly with the SEC regarding their transactions in shares of these Funds. Any violation of this
	six-month holding period will require disgorgement of any profits.





	3











	 








	3







	Pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the holding period for the closed-end funds is calculated using LIFO (last in-first out)
	whereas the holding period in Section IV.B above is calculated using FIFO.






	 




	7









	 




	2.




	Blackout Periods: Independent Directors and Access Persons may not purchase or sell shares of the Cohen & Steers closed-end Funds on certain days prior to
	board meetings and dividend declarations.





	 





	 




	a.




	For Independent Directors, the blackout period is from the date of the receipt of quarterly board materials through the close of business on the second day of the
	quarterly meeting and the issuance of a press release declaring quarterly dividends.





	 





	 




	b.




	For Access Persons, the blackout period begins two (2) weeks prior to the quarterly board meeting through the second day of that meeting.





	 





	 




	c.




	The CCO or General Counsel may impose additional blackout periods for trading in the closed-end funds as necessary.





	 





	 




	G.





	Cohen & Steers Open-End Funds







	All Access Persons are subject to the same frequent trading policies that apply to the shareholders of the Cohen & Steers open-end Funds. As such, no Access Person or Independent Director shall
	redeem any shares of the Cohen & Steers open-end Funds unless the shares have been held for at least sixty (60) days. This holding period does not apply to shares acquired through an Automatic Investment Plan.





	This holding period applies to all transactions in Cohen & Steers Open-End Funds even though such transactions do not require
	preclearance.




	 





	 




	H.





	Prohibition on Accepting Gifts







	No Access Person shall give or receive any gift in violation of the Cohen & Steers Gifts and Entertainment Policy and Procedures, which permit gifts valued cumulatively at $100 or less per person per calendar year.



	 





	 




	I.





	Investment Clubs







	Employee participation in Investment Clubs is permitted but all Investment Club transactions are subject to the restrictions and reporting requirements in this Code.



	 





	 




	J.





	Outside Directorships







	No
	Access Person shall serve on the board of directors of a publicly traded company unless approved in advance by a Co-Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Cohen & Steers, Inc. This authorization will be provided only if a Co-Chairman
	and Co-Chief Executive Officer concludes that service on the board would not be inconsistent with the interests of Cohen & Steers clients. Access Persons who have received this approval shall not trade for a client or their own




	 




	8







	account in the securities of the company while in possession of material, non-public information. Outside business activities, other than service on a board of a publicly traded company, are
	addressed in the Cohen & Steers Conflicts of Interest Policy.

	F.

	Each Access Person must certify annually within sixty (60) days of year-end that he or she has read and understands the Code and recognizes that he or she is subject to the Code. In addition, each Access Person must certify annually
	that he or she has complied with all the requirements of the Code and that he or she has disclosed or reported all personal securities transactions required to be disclosed or reported pursuant to the requirements of the Code.



	 





	 




	G.





	Independent Directors







	An
	Independent Director shall report transactions in Reportable Securities only if the director knew or, in the ordinary course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a director should have known, that during the 15-day period immediately
	preceding or following the date of the transaction (or such period prescribed by applicable law), such security was purchased or sold, or was being considered for purchase or sale, by any Cohen & Steers client.




	The should have known standard implies no duty of inquiry, does not presume there should have been any deduction or extrapolation
	from discussions or memoranda dealing with tactics to be employed meeting any Funds investment objectives, or that any knowledge is to be imputed because of prior knowledge of any Funds portfolio holdings, market considerations, or any
	Funds investment policies, objectives and restrictions.




	Independent Directors need not provide an Initial or Annual
	Holdings Report and they are not subject to the restrictions in Section IV other than F and G.



	 





	 




	H.





	Confidentiality







	All
	reports of securities transactions and any other information filed with the Compliance Department pursuant to this Code shall be treated as confidential. In this regard, no Access Person shall reveal to any other person (except in the normal course
	of his or her duties on behalf of Cohen & Steers) any information regarding securities transactions made or being considered by or on behalf of any client account.




	 




	11









	 




	I.





	Disclaimer







	Any such
	report may contain a statement that the report shall not be construed as an admission by the person making such report that he has any direct or indirect beneficial ownership in the Reportable Security to which the report relates.



	 






	VI.






	Administration of the Code of Ethics






	 





	 




	A.





	Use of Preferred Brokers







	All Access Persons are strongly encouraged to maintain their personal trading accounts at, and execute all transactions in Covered Securities through, one or more brokers that provide automated feeds to the PTA system. Accounts with brokers
	who provide account information to PTA electronically may be more accurate and require less reconciliation for the Access Person at certification time. The Compliance Department maintains the list of such brokers.



	 





	 




	B.





	Duplicate Confirmation







	All Access Persons must require their brokers to supply to Compliance on a timely basis duplicate confirmations of all personal securities transactions. When possible, the duplicate confirmation requirement will be satisfied by electronic
	feed directly from the brokers to PTA.




	If under local market practice, brokers are restricted by law from delivering duplicate
	confirmations to the Compliance Department, it is the Access Persons responsibility to provide promptly to the Compliance Department with a duplicate confirmation (either a photocopy, fax or PDF) for each trade. If a broker is unwilling to
	deliver duplicate confirmations for any other reason, the employee will not be permitted to maintain an account with that broker.



	 





	 




	C.





	Exemptions from the Code







	In cases of hardship, the CCO, the General Counsel or their respective designees can grant exemptions from the personal trading restrictions in this Code. The decision will be based on a determination that a hardship exists and the
	transaction for which an exemption is requested would not result in a conflict with Cohen & Steers clients interests. Other factors that may be considered include: the size and holding period of the Access Persons position in
	the security, the market capitalization of the issuer, the liquidity of the security, the amount and timing of client trading in the same or a related security and other relevant factors.




	Any Access Persons seeking an exemption should submit a written request setting forth the nature of the hardship along with any pertinent
	facts and reasons why the Access Person believes the exemption should be granted. Access Persons are cautioned that exemptions are exceptions and repetitive requests for exemptions by an Access Person are not likely to be granted.




	 




	12







	Records of the approval of exemptions and the reasons for granting the exemptions will be
	maintained by the Compliance Department.



	 





	 




	D.





	Fund Board of Directors Reporting and Approval







	The Board of Directors of each Fund, as applicable, including a majority of the Independent Directors, must approve this Code and any material changes to it. This approval shall be based on a
	determination that this Code contains provisions reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from engaging in any conduct prohibited by Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act or any other applicable rules and regulations,. In connection with
	this approval, Cohen & Steers shall provide a certification to the Board that Cohen & Steers and the Funds have adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating this Code.




	No less frequently than annually, Cohen & Steers shall furnish to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors must consider,
	a written report that:



	 





	 




	(1)




	Describes any issues arising under the Code or procedures since the last report to the Board of Directors, including, but not limited to, information about material
	violations of the Code or procedures or sanctions imposed in response to the material violations; and





	 





	 




	(2)




	Certifies that the Funds and Cohen & Steers have adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating the Code.





	 





	 




	E.





	Violations and Sanctions







	Access Persons must report any violations or potential violations of this Code promptly to the CCO or another member of the Legal & Compliance Department.




	Upon discovering a violation of this Code, Cohen & Steers may impose such sanctions as it deems appropriate, including, among other
	things, disgorgement of profits, a letter of censure, suspension or termination of the employment of the violator.



	 





	 




	F.





	Acknowledgments







	Each
	Access Person must be provided with a copy of this Code and any amendments. In addition, each Access Person must provide the Compliance Department with a written (or electronic) acknowledgment of their receipt of the Code and any amendments.
