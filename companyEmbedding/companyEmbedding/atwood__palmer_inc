Personalized investing isn’t about money that’s put in stock. It’s about the stock our clients put in us.
Reputation and relationships matter. They engender trust – the most essential element in effective wealth management. If investment advice comes before the establishment of client confidence, then satisfaction and success become distant possibilities. It’s all the more reason for us to get together and start a conversation.

Keen attention to a select client list defines our service.
We’re a boutique wealth management firm with fewer clients per Investment Counselor than many firms in the financial industry. So we’re more responsive, involved and in touch. Clients are never shuffled between departments or bounced around 800# menu options. Instead, we’re available whenever needed, and we pride ourselves on proactive, on-going communications.



“Clients come to us looking for something they haven’t been able to find elsewhere.”

We’re objective, goal-driven,unbiased investment counselors.
The way an investment firm is compensated can be an indicator of how they do business. If they earn commissions, they may be predisposed to recommend products over pure objectives. We’re a fee-based investment advisory firm, which makes us more flexible and impartial when developing clearly defined investment strategies in concert with our clients.

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $996.59 million. CA had a return on equity of 17.15% and a net margin of 19.20%.

Personalized investing isn’t about money that’s put in stock. It’s about the stock our clients put in us.
Reputation and relationships matter. They engender trust – the most essential element in effective wealth management. If investment advice comes before the establishment of client confidence, then satisfaction and success become distant possibilities. It’s all the more reason for us to get together and start a conversation.
