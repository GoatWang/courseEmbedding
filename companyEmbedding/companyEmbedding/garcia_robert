Product Description:



Tributees: Jerry Garcia; Robert Hunter.Personnel: Emory Joseph (vocals, acoustic guitar, tambourine); T-Bone Wolk (vocals, guitar, accordion, electric bass); Jon Carroll (vocals, guitar, keyboards); Duke Levine (guitars, slide guitar, mandola); David Grisman (mandolin); Lincoln Schleifer (bass instrument); Dennis McDermott (drums, percussion); Soozie Tyrell (background vocals).For his second album, singer-songwriter Emory Joseph decided to pay tribute to the Grateful Dead's immortal songwriting team of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter. Leaving the Dead's psychedelic, jam-happy side far behind, Joseph focuses on Garcia and Hunter's concise, country-folk songcraft, delivering such Dead gems as "It Must Have Been the Roses" and "To Lay Me Down" with just the right combination of reverence and freshness, his laconic vocal style sometimes taking on a rather Garcia-like tone.

A Fresh Take on Old FavoritesAs a long-time fan of Jerry Garcia I know Jerry himself would often reinvent his tunes with new arrangements on different performances.  Now that he's gone interpreters like Emory Joseph carry on that tradition with tasty playing, insightful arrangements, and the right feel for these songs.By mgainey (Louisville, KY)
