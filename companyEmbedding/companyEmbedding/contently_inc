Transform magazine: The type writer: "A brand is an attitude" - 2015 ...

It is worth remembering that a brand is not a visual or aural identity. A brand is what a company stands for – it is an attitude. A brand is a promise to every customer that tells them what they can expect and exactly how the offering is different to competitors’. The visual and aural elements are an expression of the brand that potential customers can identify with, and by which they can identify the brand. The identity must be as carefully built and maintained as the brand itself.

Interactions involve communication, brand space, and product and service elements. These elements work together to affect brand equity....read more

Brands Evolve With Faceting Strategy | Branding Strategy Insider

Brands Evolve With Faceting Strategy | Branding Strategy.   Some experts will tell you that a brand should present a consistent identity and should not change, at the risk of losing its loyal franchise. The risk, however, is that after a period of minor incremental changes the brand will become increasingly irrelevant, and this kind of a static approach ends in the need to radically reposition the brand to catch up with a fast moving, dynamic and competitive marketplace...n the past, brand management paradigms stressed the unchanging quality of the brand. Today, this perspective can seriously interfere with the organic development of the brand. Wise brand managers now realize that it is natural for a brand to change over time...read more
