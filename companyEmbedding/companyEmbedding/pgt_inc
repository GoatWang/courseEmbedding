PGT, Inc. to Acquire WinDoor, Inc.
Strengthens Position in High-End Commercial and Residential Impact Fenestration Markets

N. VENICE, Fla., Nov.  30, 2015  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PGT, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGTI), the nation's leading manufacturer and supplier of residential impact-resistant windows and doors, announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire WinDoor, Incorporated. Located in Orlando, Florida, WinDoor provides high-performance, impact-resistant windows and doors for five-star resorts, luxury high-rise condominiums, hotels and custom residential homes. The acquisition combines the strengths of PGT, Inc. and WinDoor, Inc. by leveraging PGTI's breadth of capabilities and resources with WinDoor's specialty expertise in areas such 
as thermally-broken products and award-winning doors to deliver an unparalleled impact-resistant product offering to consumers, builders, and architects.
"WinDoor's seasoned management team has done a fantastic job of building a solid and successful business that produces exceptional products," stated Rod Hershberger, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of PGTI. "We are most excited, however, that PGTI and WinDoor share a strong family-centric culture that values quality and craftsmanship. I am very pleased to announce the addition of another strong brand of products into our PGTI portfolio." WinDoor, Inc. will become a wholly owned subsidiary of PGTI. The transaction, valued at approximately $102 million, is consistent with PGTI's plan to grow strategically while contributing to earnings growth through targeted acquisitions of complementary specialty products. This acquisition will improve PGTI's EBITDA margin, and the deal is expected to be 
earnings accretive within 12 to 18 months, depending on the cost of capital for the new credit facility. The transaction will introduce a third brand to the PGTI portfolio to include PGT, CGI, and WinDoor. All three business units focus on serving the impact-resistant window and door industry. The acquisition is expected to:  Enhance PGTI's leadership position in the growing impact-resistant window and door industry while offering its customers a wide variety of offeringsAdd a high quality company with strong margins; for 2015 WinDoor's margins will be higher than PGTI'sDiversify and broaden PGTI's brand and product portfolio, including the addition of thermally-broken products and more comprehensive sliding & swing door product linesIncrease penetration into the commercial and high-end fenestration marketsStrengthen 
the Company's ability to compete against national suppliers and other storm protection systemsCreate synergies by maximizing efficiencies and scale including purchasing and logisticsBroaden manufacturing footprint and capabilities  "The acquisition of WinDoor aligns with our corporate growth strategy to acquire brands and products that generate revenue and leverage our core capabilities," said Jeff Jackson, PGTI's President, and Chief Operating Officer. "Rapid growth requires us to stay focused on what we know and leverage synergies between business units. This acquisition marks the second within the past 18 months that enables PGTI to deliver a richer and more comprehensive portfolio to our customers within the impact-resistant window and door market. The combination of the companies' strengths and cultures 
will deliver a richer product offering to our customers, extend more opportunities to our collective workforce and promote stronger returns for our shareholders." Subject to customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the middle of the first quarter of 2016. Deutsche Bank and Suntrust have committed to providing a long-term debt facility of $350 million ($255 pro forma debt, net of undrawn revolver and cash liquidity) which will be used to consummate the acquisition, repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. After the transaction closes: WinDoor, Inc. will continue to operate and manufacture products in Orlando, Florida.WinDoor, Inc. will remain a separate and distinct 
brand in the marketplace.PGTI will leverage best practices and synergies of [PGT Windows & Doors], CGI and WinDoor to provide incremental value to employees, customers, business partners, and stockholders.    "I am extremely proud of the commitment and passion of our employees. For over 15 years, we have had a mission of craftsmanship, attention to detail and ultra-high performance.  Becoming part of the PGT family allows that mission to continue for many more years to come," commented Frank Lukens, Founder of WinDoor. "We have found a culture and a management team that embody the best of the philosophies on which WinDoor was founded. This is such an exciting moment in the history of 
WinDoor, and I couldn't imagine a better pairing than WinDoor and PGT." PGT, Inc. will host a conference call on Wednesday, December 9th 2015, to discuss the acquisition as well as other business matters. The teleconference will begin at 2:30pm eastern time and will be hosted by Rod Hershberger, Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Jackson, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Brad West, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

WinGuard® Vinyl
















WinGuard® Vinyl

Benefit Information


What PGT® New WinGuard® Vinyl means to you

Hurricane Protection
During a hurricane, flying debris can break the glass in regular windows and doors, resulting in wind and water damage inside your home. WinGuard Vinyl products can withstand repeated impact from a nine pound 2' x 4' beam traveling at 34 miles per hour, followed by hurricane-force winds. Even if the glass is damaged, it will remain secure in its frame and continue to keep the elements outside.

Peace of Mind
Breaking a window is the most common means of entry for an intruder. While non-impact resistant glass shatters easily upon contact and offers little resistance, the durable interlayer used in WinGuard Vinyl products will keep the glass in place and provide an additional barrier that deters intruders.

UV Protection
Constant exposure to the sun's UV rays can dramatically fade your furnishings. The clear interlayer used in WinGuard Vinyl products filters 99% of these UV rays, helping your furniture, carpet, artwork and drapes retain their original beauty.

Noise Reduction
Noise outside your home is often something you have little control over. However, with WinGuard Vinyl windows and doors, the laminated glass significantly reduces ambient noise by absorbing sound rather than transmitting it, which keeps outside disruptions where they belong.

Earnings Release
PGTI Reports 2017 First Quarter Results and Reiterates 2017 Outlook
•Sales of $113 million Is First Quarter Record
--First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights versus First Quarter 2016
--Net sales of $112.7 million, an increase of $12.5 million, or 12 percent;
--Gross margin of 28.2 percent, compared to 29.9 percent;
--Net income of $3.0 million, compared to $1.5 million;
--Net income, as adjusted, of $3.8 million, compared to $4.5 million;
--Net income per diluted share of $0.06, compared to $0.03;
--Adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.07, compared to $0.09
PGT Innovations, Inc. (PGTI), the leading U.S. manufacturer and 
      supplier of impact-resistant windows and doors, announced financial 
      results for its first quarter ended April 1, 2017.
"We delivered a company record for sales in a first quarter at $113 
      million, up 12 percent compared to last year. This compares to a 5 
      percent increase in single-family housing starts in Florida, an 
      indication that we continued to take share in our core market," 
      commented PGT Innovations Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive 
      Officer, Rod Hershberger.
Hershberger continued, "We have focused on strengthening our position in 
      Florida, one of the best markets over the past four years. During this 
      period, we have greatly expanded operations of our flagship PGT product, 
      and acquired CGI and WinDoor, the latter of which focuses on the 
      high-end market. While we are pleased with WinDoors first quarter 2017 
      sales amount, its seasonally low first quarter sales makes it too early 
      to gauge the degree of any recovery from the softness in the luxury 
      market we experienced in 2016. However, we remain confident WinDoor is 
      well-positioned to capitalize on this recovery."
"Our three-brand go-to-market strategy continues to be a strategic 
      success for us," commented Jeff Jackson, PGT Innovations President. 
      "The execution of our strategic initiatives in the first quarter 
      included making certain planned changes in our management structure to 
      align our organization to better capitalize on market opportunities. 
      These changes were directed towards maximizing the effectiveness and 
      efficiency of our leadership team, which has strengthened our bench and 
      improved our strategic execution."
Jackson continued, "Sales in the first quarter of 2017 finished strong 
      after a slow start to the year in our markets, with average weekly 
      shipments in March solidly higher than last year, especially in our 
      mass-custom products. Sales growth in the first quarter of 2017 was led 
      by a 24 percent increase in our vinyl impact products, driven by an 
      increase in sales of our mass-custom vinyl WinGuard products, as demand 
      in that product category continues to be strong. Additionally, as 
      expected, our margins compared to the first quarter of 2016 were 
      unfavorably impacted by a full quarter of WinDoors fixed costs in the 
      first quarter of 2017. The first six-weeks are typically the lowest 
      sales period of the year for WinDoor, and we carry variable and fixed 
      costs in preparation for future higher volume typically seen during the 
      remainder of the year."
Jackson closed stating, "The construction of our new, leased location in 
      Miami, Florida is progressing as planned. This new facility in our core 
      Florida market will enable us to increase our manufacturing capabilities 
      and enhance operational efficiencies by combining parts of our 
      production, distribution, and marketing efforts across all of our 
      brands."
Fiscal Year 2017 Outlook
"We remain confident in the long-term strength of our core market of 
      Florida, and continue to see demand increase across all of our brands. 
      Our backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2017 stood at over $56 
      million, compared to $44 million at the end of the first quarter of 
      2016, up 27 percent. This dynamic environment sets us up for a solid 
      second quarter, and we look forward to the spring 2017 home buying and 
      remodeling season," said Brad West, PGT Innovations Chief Financial 
      Officer. "We continue to expect full-year sales to range between $490 
      and $500 million, representing an increase of between 7 and 9 percent, 
      and we expect sales in this range will generate consolidated EBITDA of 
      between $83 and $87 million."

Statements in this press release that are forward-looking statements 
      include, without limitation, our expectations regarding: (1) the market 
      for high-end, luxury window and door products, including our ability to 
      capitalize on a recovery in that market, which experienced softness in 
      2016; (2) the impact that our acquisition of WinDoor, Inc. may have on 
      our sales and performance in the market for high-end windows and doors; 
      (3) the possible benefits of changes in our management structure, 
      including being able to better capitalize on market opportunities; (4) 
      the possible benefits of our three-brand go-to-market strategy; (5) 
      benefits expected from our new, leased manufacturing facility in Miami, 
      Florida, which currently is under construction; (6) the 2017 Spring home 
      construction/buying season in the Florida market; and (7) our projected 
      financial performance, results and outlook for 2017, including our 
      expectations regarding full-year sales and EBITDA. You are cautioned not 
      to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak 
      only as of the date of this press release. Except as required by law, 
      the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking 
      statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances after the date 
      of this press release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This Press Release and the financial schedules include financial 
      measures and terms not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally 
      accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We believe that presentation of 
      non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income, adjusted net income per 
      share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides investors and analysts with 
      an alternative method for assessing our operating results in a manner 
      that enables investors and analysts to more thoroughly evaluate our 
      current performance compared to past performance. We also believe these 
      non-GAAP measures provide investors with a better baseline for assessing 
      our future earnings potential. The non-GAAP measures included in this 
      release are provided to give investors access to types of measures that 
      we use in analyzing our results.
Adjusted net income consists of GAAP net income adjusted for the items 
      included in the accompanying reconciliation. Adjusted net income per 
      share consists of GAAP net income per share adjusted for the items 
      included in the accompanying reconciliation. We believe these measures 
      enable investors and analysts to more thoroughly evaluate our current 
      performance as compared to the past performance and provide a better 
      baseline for assessing the Companys future earnings potential. However, 
      these measures do not provide a complete picture of our operations.
EBITDA consists of GAAP net income adjusted for the items included in 
      the accompanying reconciliation. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA 
      adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation. We 
      believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to 
      investors and analysts about the Companys performance because they 
      eliminate the effects of period-to-period changes in taxes, costs 
      associated with capital investments and interest expense. EBITDA and 
      adjusted EBITDA do not give effect to the cash the Company must use to 
      service its debt or pay its income taxes and thus do not reflect the 
      funds generated from operations or actually available for capital 
      investments.
Our calculations of adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, 
      EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to 
      calculations performed by other companies and reported as similarly 
      titled measures. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in 
      addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be 
      considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP measures. Schedules that 
      reconcile adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA and 
      adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income are included in the financial 
      schedules accompanying this release.

Built for strength, protection and beauty, PGT® Architectural Systems serves the needs of the commercial and residential high-rise window market.  PGT Architectural Systems represents an investment in lasting quality, backed by a solid warranty of up to 20 years.  Each PGT Architectural Systems product is custom-built to exact specifications and offers a wide variety of options, allowing you flexibility in your new construction, remodeling or replacement projects, as well as historical restorations.

product line updatePerformance Information


Design pressure is not compromised for size because of our quality engineering practices. We meet some of the highest design loads ( up to +/-165 psf) with the tested sizing options you need. Meeting the highest design standards also means unparalleled protection against water intrusion. We pass the tough testing requirements for Miami-Dade NOAs, AAMA and ASTM, and our storefront entrances meet ADA requirements. We meet the building codes you will need to comply with when installing new windows or doors.




Benefit Information


More Than Just Hurricane Protection.
Architectural Systems windows and doors are aesthetically pleasing. The products' sight lines are narrow so you can have clear, unobstructed views. We allow you to fill bigger openings with fewer windows because our offering is tested to large sizes. We have hidden all fasteners and screws to enhance the sleek sophisticated design of these windows and doors.
Protection Beyond Mother Nature.
The materials and craftsmanship found in Architectural Systems protect in other ways too. They protect against intruders, since impact-resistant glass and heavy-duty frames are as resistant to vandals as they are to hurricane debris. They reduce noise, keeping outside sounds out and serenity in. They protect against UV rays, filtering out up to 99 percent of those rays to keep drapes, rugs and furniture looking new. Glass options and Low-E coatings offer additional protection and energy efficiency.
Easy to Install. Easy to Maintain.
Architectural Systems windows and doors feature fewer components to reduce installation time. They also have strong frames - from three inches on the windows and up to six inches on the sliding glass door - to eliminate common damage during installation or when attaching hardware. They are designed to be installed easily, without damaging openings, exteriors or interiors.
Our commercial storefront products are factory glazed and fabricated. There is no need to manage troublesome job site issues of weather, debris and time crunches when trying to glaze a product because we do it for you.
Service is simple, should the product need cleaning, maintenance or even replacement. Exterior panes, track inserts and more can all be accessed or removed from the inside, eliminating the hassle of reaching the building's windows from the outside.

PGT: A Promising Stock Creating Value - PGT, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGTI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»PGT: A Promising Stock Creating ValueNov. 9.15 | About: PGT, Inc. (PGTI) Daniel Bacchi Long only, small-cap, industrials, long-term horizonSummaryValue creation through inorganic growth that has positioned the company for solid growth into 2016.Innovative product line receiving continued updates.PGT Inc.'s revenue will rely on a continuation of growth in construction in Florida.The growth in construction for 2015 has been a great catalyst for growth throughout markets in the U.S.
Each month has seen an increase in construction spending, and outlook points to the trend continuing into 2016. September saw an increase of 0.6 in private construction, the highest point seen since 2008.
Florida has seen a rise in single-family house construction of 22% in the 3rd quarter of 2015. Repair and remolding equally saw a share of increases through the period and into the 4th quarter of 2015.
The increases have resulted in value creation for many construction-related companies. PGT, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGTI) is one such company that has grown through dynamic organic growth due to current market conditions as well as through inorganic growth via acquisitions.
With a product line boasting impact resistance, PGTI has gained traction in the southeastern United States. In that area hurricanes have been more prevalent and fiercer the past few years; consensus has linked global warming with the increase in strength of hurricanes, projecting future storms with fiercer results.
This is where PGT, Inc. has come to the rescue. The differentiation of a high-quality product offering protection through the worst of storms has allowed PGT, Inc. to gain market share, and the outlook for the future looks solid.
Strategic Acquisitions
In 2014 PGT acquired a competitor in the same market, CGI Windows and Doors Inc. The acquisition allowed PGT to focus on sales and not on competing on price in the market. Along with the ability to allow organic growth in the Florida market, the acquisition provided PGT with a similar product building revenue growth while resulting in reduced costs through economies of scale.
Fiscal year 2015 saw a 28% growth in revenue for PGT, resulting from a stronger construction market as well as from the acquisition. But increased costs translated into a decreased EBITDA margin, from 16.2% in 2014 to 14.6% in 2015. Through cost cutting initiatives, PGT was able to increase the margin for the LTM to 16.1%, showing PGT's ability to control costs and create value.

The catalyst for future value creation will be reliant on PGT's strategies to control costs. Its past appreciation for vertical integration leads investors to believe that PGT's acquisition outlook into the future looks solid. Coupled with investment into efficient lines through the past periods will hopefully contribute to increasing margins.
The balance sheet shows PGT's ability to grow inorganically. A current cash balance of 13.6% of total assets, a debt weight of 21.7% and a D/E ratio below 1 points to one outlook: PGT has room for financing its future with debt. This situation leaves investors to believe that an acquisition of another competitor or supplier will happen in the future.
Product Offerings
Innovative products are the key differentiation that has allowed PGT and CGI to effectively manage and grow their revenue. Both PGT and CGI are market leaders of impact-resistant windows and doors. Stringent regulation on new construction and remodeling has positioned PGT's products as top-of-the-line and the go-to in their main market, Florida, which accounts for 88% of the company's sales (in FY 2014). With a history of innovation in the field, it is likely that PGT will continue to meet the needs of customers into the continuing period.
At this point brand name alone sells PGT's products. But focused attention on increasing quality of the products and services are a key selling point. PGT trains its customers, installers, dealers and architects to provide maximum value to the end user in their application.
The increased intensity of storms in the region has shown a necessity for a product that delivers performance. PGT and CGI's offerings have given the protection necessary for consumers, and past organic growth - 37% revenue growth in 2013, 28% in 2014 and 32% in the LTM - shows the future potential for the company's continued value creation.
Niche Market
Because PGT mainly serves the Florida market, it is tied to the performance of construction in Florida. The past periods have shown consistent growth, similar to the U.S. as a whole. In southern Florida construction spending increased $1.2B, or 19%, from the same period a year ago.

Efficiency is a key metric for new home construction. About 40% of new homes are more efficient than those built prior to 2013. PGT's product offering bodes well with the idea of efficiency, and continued interest in efficiency in the Florida market will allow PGT to grow into the future.
Conclusion
PGT has shown excellent growth in the past few years and continued growth, and value creation is not only possible but looks likely based on management guidance and overall market outlook. Controlling costs will be paramount to continued value creation into the future periods.

product line updatePerformance Information


 
Only quality materials are used in the manufacturing of PGT Vinyl Windows and Doors. All frames are made of 100% virgin uPVC* vinyl, which contains micro ingredients that enhance heat and color stability. Utilizing state-of-the-art technology, a highly skilled workforce and rigorous quality control measures, we provide a complete line of custom-built, virtually maintenance-free, energy-efficient windows and doors used for new construction and replacement windows that are Visibly Better®. In fact, PGT Vinyl Windows and Doors feature a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the window frames and insulating glass.
PGT Vinyl Windows and Doors have Florida State Product Approval and have been tested to AAMA/NWWDA 101/I.S.2.7 specifications. They have also been designed to meet the following test standards:
ASTM E283 for air infiltration
ASTM E987 for deglazing
ASTM E547/E331 for water resistance
AAMA 1302.5 for forced entry for operable windows
AAMA 1303.5 for forced entry resistance for doors

Benefit Information


 
PGT® Vinyl Windows and Doors feature a beautiful, clean look that’s virtually maintenance-free. Unlike wood sashes and frames that split, rot and require regular painting, vinyl frames are highly resistant to all the environmental factors that limit the life of wooden frames. Vinyl’s superior insulation keeps the frame tight and intact, without swelling or warping.
PGT Vinyl Windows and Doors even make it easy to perform what little maintenance is required. All single hung windows and double hung windows feature a convenient tilt-in sash for easy cleaning of both inside and outside surfaces.
New windows can do much more than beautify your home. They can also lower your energy bills. From the quality materials used in the frames to the double-pane insulating glass used in their assembly, PGT Vinyl Windows and Doors are your homes best barrier against wasted energy. When purchased with appropriate options, vinyl windows and doors are extremely energy efficient. There are many Energy Star® rated window and door configurations available.
