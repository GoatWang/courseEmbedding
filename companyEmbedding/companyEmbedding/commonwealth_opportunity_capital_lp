Hedge Fund Rising Stars: Adam Fisher









Adam Fisher
    Commonwealth Opportunity Capital

    Adam Fisher made a splash in 2010 when Barrons published
    an article in which he explained how to invest in Europes
    ongoing problems. A decade earlier Fisher had left an
    event-­driven hedge fund to go out on his own. In 2006,
    Fisher, who has a BS in political science and economics from
    Washington University and a joint law degree and MBA from
    ­Columbia ­University, left Los Angeles for Hong Kong
    to take advantage of low-­priced real estate,
    co-­founding Orient Property Group with backing from hedge
    fund firm D. E. Shaw & Co. Fisher, now 40, returned to Los
    Angeles in 2008 to launch with Reagan Silber a global macro
    hedge fund firm, Commonwealth Opportunity Capital. Starting in
    December 2008 with $20 million from friends and family,
    the fund returned 40 percent in 2009, 7 percent in 2010, 10.8
    percent in 2011 and 7.9 percent through March 2012.
