Start your career as a financial advisor Join our Practice Management Development (PMD) program




Merrill Lynch offers robust careers for financial advisors, including those starting a finance career with our Practice Management Development program.











 
Choose a career path that offers you:
Independence1
Be an entrepreneur who builds and manages a business.
Fulfillment
Make a meaningful difference in the lives of clients.
Income2
Receive a base salary plus an uncapped, unlimited annual income opportunity.
We recognize that it's the power of our people and our differences that make us a stronger company. We're proud of our commitment to attracting, recruiting and retaining top diverse talent from across the globe.
What do you need to become a Merrill Lynch financial advisor?
You’ll need perseverance to succeed — but what you don’t necessarily need is a financial services background. We’re searching for high achievers with a track record of continued success, in all industries and careers, such as:

Accountants
Attorneys
Bankers
CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professionals3
Community leaders
Consultants
Entrepreneurs
Fundraisers
Insurance agents
Military personnel
Professional athletes
Real estate agents and developers
Risk managers
Sales and marketing professionals
Teachers and educators

 
Join a culture of achievement
If you have a background of accomplishment, you can transfer that into a career that leverages your past successes. Ask yourself these questions:

Do you have an entrepreneurial spirit?4
Are you self-motivated and have strong relationship-building skills?
Do you pride yourself on being resilient when facing challenges?
Do you have integrity and high ethical standards?
Do you demonstrate a willingness to take action?

 
If you answered "yes" to these questions, consider the opportunity for a dynamic new career path as a Merrill Lynch financial advisor.
What is the PMD program?
When you join Merrill Lynch, you'll tap into wealth management experience that has been formally training and coaching new advisors through our PMD program since 1946. The PMD program is designed to develop the critical skills and knowledge necessary for building a successful wealth management practice — acquiring clients, enhancing relationships, providing tailored strategies and more.
The 43 month PMD program includes multiple components of:

Investment, business development, business management and technology platform training and development
Personalized coaching and support during each phase of the program
Preparation for registration exams, including Series 7 and Series 66

 
Choose one of three paths to become a Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor
Regardless of the role you eventually assume, you'll access the deep resources and full capabilities of both Merrill Lynch and Bank of America.
PMD Financial Advisor
Help clients pursue their goals
As a PMD financial advisor, your support team includes a group of specialists with experience in banking, credit, retirement, insurance and investments, including access to the full capabilities of Bank of America and its innovative banking services. This combined support will help clients pursue their financial goals.
Team Financial Advisor
Play an integral role on a larger team
You'll play a specific role — in either business development, planning, investments and financing, business management or relationship management — contributing to the overall efforts of the team. In addition, you'll take advantage of an accelerated curriculum (one year shorter than the standard PMD program).
Bank Team Financial Advisor
Provide client access to the full breadth of firm resources
After a length of service (LOS) of 3 months, you'll have the potential opportunity to work in a Bank of America financial center as a PMD financial advisor. You'll be able to build your team's book of business with preferred and affluent clients who already have a banking relationship.
Opportunities to help develop your wealth management business

The Optimal Practice Model® is a multifaceted framework that shares the practices of the industry's top financial advisors and the activities that have made them successful. The framework focuses on business management, business development, planning, investments and financing, relationship management, and service and administration.
Goals-Based Wealth Management (GBWM) is a comprehensive and powerful approach to help you guide clients toward more appropriate investment decisions, uncover their concerns and priorities, and develop portfolios that align their resources with what they want to achieve now and in the future.

 
Come to a firm that supports you with marketing tools and other valuable resources

Turnkey strategies and easy-to-use marketing tools such as web pages, fact sheets and brochures to help you develop and market your business quickly
Thoughtful, professionally written magazines, videos and newsletters
Industry-leading insights and analysis from BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research; and our comprehensive investment platform5
Employee Networks — which can help you develop leadership skills and connect with people across the business and globally — based on age, ethnicity, lifestyle and professional goals




Merrill Lynch's PMD program won a Silver Award for "Best Sales Training and Performance Program" in the 2016 Brandon Hall Group Sales Performance Awards.6

My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.







These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.







One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.

My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.

These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.

One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.

Koskie Minsky LLP and Siskinds LLP Announce Court Approve $32.5 Million Settlement with Underwriters in Sino-Forest Class Action
Nov 11 15
Siskinds LLP and Koskie Minsky LLP, class counsel in the Sino-Forest class action, announced that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has approved a CAD 32.5 million settlement with Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc., TD Securities Inc., Dundee Securities Corporation, RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Scotia Capital Inc., CIBC World Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., Canaccord Financial Ltd., Maison Placements Canada Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (collectively, the Underwriters). The Underwriters were various financial institutions that served as underwriters in one or more of Sino-Forest's public offerings of shares and notes. On October 30, 2015, Regional Senior Justice Geoffrey Morawetz made an order approving this historic settlement. The settlement agreement provides for the Underwriters to pay CAD 32.5 million in settlement of all claims arising from their dealings with Sino-Forest. The class action alleges that Sino-Forest, certain of its directors and officers, auditors and underwriters misled investors concerning the business and accounting at the collapsed timber trader. The plaintiffs include The Trustees of the Labourers' Pension Fund of Central and Eastern Canada and The Trustees of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 793 Pension Plan for Operating Engineers in Ontario. Siskinds' securities class actions team is complemented by lawyers in Siskinds' affiliate, Siskinds, Desmeules, based in Quebec City.

My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.







These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.







One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.

My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.







These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.







One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.

My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.







These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.







One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.

These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.







One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.







My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.

These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.

One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.

My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.

My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.

One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.

These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.







My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.

One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.







My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.







These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.

My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.







These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.







One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.

My dad had his money managed here.   When he passed away, it was obvious they had worked with him to make sure everything was completely squared away for my mom...   It was executed with great passion and forethought and the result was a seamless transition for mom.    This success in investing and compassionate administration is priceless.

I have moved all of my investing and banking here and feel all the better for it.   I look forward to a long relationship here.   My experiences so far with banking and retirement account management has been top rate.







These guys are sneaky, deceiving and play games when you try get things done with your account. The VP handling our account, Mr Hogan constantly challenges us when wanting to move money out or change our assest allocation based on needs. While he lives a lavious lifestyle remotely in Hawaii, he almost never contacts the client to check in and do an update on the needs for the portfolio, rather he works the portfolio to collect commisions plus his hidden fees. Then when you want to move the account he claims you are taking money off their operation business costs to keep things running.







One would hope that Financial Advisers would not have a record of repeated law suits for non-payment of credit card bills, attorney's bills, and a mortgage.  But that is what you will get with Scott Roberts.  Be very careful, do your homework, find out that this man is a liar and don't trust him with your money.
