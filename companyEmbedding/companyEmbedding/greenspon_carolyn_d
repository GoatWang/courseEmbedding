Meet The New York Times' New Director: Carolyn Greenspon

Carolyn Greenspon, great-great-granddaughter of Adolph S. Ochs.Carolyn Greenspon, a 41-year-old psychotherapist who works in Wellesley, Mass., has just been voted in as a director of the New York Times board. She is a fifth-generation member of the family that controls The New York Times Co. (NYT).
She was approved to the board at the Times' annual stockholders' meeting on Tuesday.
Times made the announcement:
The Sulzbergers control a majority of voting stock in the Times Company through a family trust. With her selection, Ms. Greenspon becomes the first member of the generation after Mr. Sulzberger and Mr. Cohen to serve on the board. She is a great-great-granddaughter of Adolph S. Ochs, the patriarch who bought The Times newspaper in 1896.
As we reported in January, Daniel Cohen, New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr.'s cousin and one of his closest advisers, left the Times Co.'s board on Monday. He has served since 2007.
The Times nominated Greenspon back in February.  "As a fifth-generation member of the Ochs/Sulzberger family, she brings a deep understanding of our Company's historic mission and its long-term business objectives," Sulzberger said back in February.

Specializes in developing “next generation” talent, and provides support as young adults discover how to be leaders and owners in the family enterprise
Leverages nearly twenty years of clinical experience working with couples, individuals and families from a family systems perspective
Assists family enterprises in managing complex ownership systems and works with multi-generational families to prepare for transitions
Develops family governance procedures and family office management strategies, designed to improve overall efficiency and effectiveness
Draws upon extensive personal experience as a fifth-generation member of a business-owning family and trustee and Board member of family enterprise
Leverages skills gained at Kellogg Graduate School of Management’s “Governing the Family Business” program and Family Firm Institute’s “Family Business Advising” certificate program (in progress)
Presents at leading conferences such as Young Presidents Organization and Babson College’s Institute for Family Enterprising on various topics, including: “Engaging and Developing the Next Generation,” and “Establishing Family Governance Systems”
Current research focus: “The Unintended Consequences of Family Trusts”

Carolyn Dryfoos Greenspon successfully leverages her extensive experience in working with families to build effective family governance structures and to prepare the next generation to assume responsibility as owners and leaders of the family enterprise. Carolyn is passionately committed to her belief that “if you take care of the family, you take care of the business,” and she relies on this philosophy as the cornerstone of her outstanding work in the areas of transition and family governance.
Before joining Relative Solutions, Carolyn had a psychotherapy practice for 18 years, working with children, adolescents, adults and families. In addition to her work as a therapist, Carolyn had a private consulting practice working with multigenerational family businesses and families who share substantial assets.
As a fifth-generation member of a family business, Carolyn is uniquely qualified to combine her years of specialized, focused training with her personal experience navigating the complexity of membership in a family which shares financial and business assets.
Carolyn received her undergraduate degree from Duke University, and her Masters in Social Work from Simmons College in Boston. Additionally, she earned post-graduate certificates in Substance Abuse Treatment and Child Psychotherapy. She is a member of the Family Firm Institute.
