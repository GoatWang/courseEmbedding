 The ATLAS study just reached a milestone by enrolling it’s 300 subject today! We initially launched this study in 2016 and it’s currently active in 17 different sites. 
The objectives of the study are to:
1.	Compare impact of POAF among two randomized treatment arms; patients with POAF and surgical LAA closure (using AtriClip Gillinov-Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems) versus patients with POAF and no surgical LAA closure.
2.	Evaluate Healthcare resource utilization [i.e. Hospital length of stay (LOS), emergency room and/or hospital re-admissions, and costs associated with specific adverse events that may be related to atrial fibrillation]. 
The target population for this study are patients without a documented history of Afib (AF) who are undergoing structural heart procedure and are at a high risk of developing post-operative AF (POAF) and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events.

History of AtriCure
Since the founding and incorporation of AtriCure, the commitment to innovation has been relentless.
 
 




	Michael Hooven and his wife, Sue Spies, co-founded ENABLE Medical Corporation. ENABLE Medical’s first product was a pair of radiofrequency energized surgical scissors designed to harvest saphenous veins in cardiac bypass procedures, IMA harvesting, and general surgical applications.
2000
In November, AtriCure was established as an independent business focused on atrial fibrillation. ENABLE Medical provided contract development and manufacturing services to AtriCure.
2001
The AtriCure bipolar ablation system was made commercially available in the U.S. for the ablation of soft tissues.
2002
The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery published the first article on AtriCure devices--"Chronic Transmural Atrial Ablation by Using Bipolar Radiofrequency Energy on the Beating Heart." The article was authored by Sunil M. Prasad, M.D., Hersh S. Maniar, M.D., Richard B. Schuessler, Ph.D., and Ralph J. Damiano, Jr., M.D.
2005
On August 5, 2005, AtriCure became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. Prior to AtriCure's initial public offering, AtriCure acquired ENABLE Medical and all of its personnel, facilities and other assets.
AtriCure opened its European office in the Netherlands.
2007
AtriCure entered the cryosurgical market when it acquired the Frigitronics cryogenic product line from CooperSurgical, Inc.
AtriCure launched the EXCLUDE trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the AtriClip LAA Exclusion System for occluding the left atrial appendage.
2008
The Isolator Coolrail Linear Pen was made commercially available in the U.S. for ablation of cardiac tissue with radiofrequency energy during cardiac surgery.
The first patient was enrolled in the ABLATE Study. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the AtriCure Bipolar System in performing pulmonary vein isolations and the atrial “connecting lesions” of the Maze procedure.
2009
AtriCure’s cryoICE and cryo1 cryoablation probes were made commercially available in the U.S. for the cryosurgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. 
2010
The AtriClip LAA Exclusion System was made commercially available in the U.S. for the occlusion of the left atrial appendage, under direct visualization, in conjunction with other open cardiac surgical procedures.
The first patient was enrolled in AtriCure’s DEEP AF feasibility study. The study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of a dual epicardial and endocardial ablation procedure for patients presenting with persistent atrial fibrillation or longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation.
2011
Following successful completion of the ABLATE study, AtriCure’s Isolator Synergy ablation system became the first device approved by FDA for the treatment of persistent or longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation.
 



2012
AtriCure partnered with Dr. James L. Cox and launched the Maze IV training program in the United States to educate healthcare providers on the safe and effective use of the AtriCure Isolator Synergy System in the treatment of non-paroxysmal forms of atrial fibrillation.
2013
AtriCure expanded the Maze IV training program to Europe.
2014
A milestone was reached as AtriCure surpassed 150,000 ablations and over 200,000 patients treated.
The Minneapolis office was also opened.
AtriCure acquired Endoscopic Technologies, Inc. (Estech), which expanded AtriCure's product portfolio with the addition of the Fusion Surgical Ablation System and a comprehensive suite of cardiac surgery instruments. As a result, AtriCure opened the San Ramon office.
2015
Launched the availability of its cryoICE cryo ablation probe (CRYO2) to provide cryoanalgesia for temporary pain management. AtriCure’s cryoICE is the first cryoablation probe made commercially available in the U.S. for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and for the temporary ablation of peripheral nerves to block pain.
A milestone in LAA management is reached with more than 50,000 patients worldwide having been treated with AtriClip LAA Exclusion System.
AtriCure acquired nContact Surgical, LLC., a privately held developer of innovative cardiac ablation solutions.
On November 3, 2015, the Cincinnati headquarters opened its newly built facility in Mason, Ohio.
AtriCure announces first patient enrolled in international Afib clinical study, Combined Endoscopic Epicardial and Percutaneous Endocardial Ablation versus Repeated Catheter Ablation in Persistent and Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation (CEASE-AF).


	First patient enrolled in ATLAS clinical study. This observational study explores the use of the AtriClip device to decrease complications associated with Post-Operative Afib (POAF) by targeting specific cardiac surgery patient populations at the highest risk of developing POAF.
The cryoFORM cryoablation probe was made commercially available in the U.S. This probe offers increased probe flexibility to adapt to a variety of surgical ablation procedures.
A new AtriClip device, called the AtriClip PRO2 was made commercially available in the U.S and European markets. This new device has increased functionality that enhances the capability of occluding the left atrial appendage in minimally-invasive cardiac surgeries.
Gained approval for the AtriClip products and cryoICE platform in Japan.
First patient enrolled in the FROST trial. This clinical study examines the cryoICE Cryoablation Probe, CRYO2, for pain management in post thoracic procedures via intercostal cryoanalgesia.
STS 2017 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Surgical Treatment of Afib changed surgical ablation at the time of structural heart surgery from a Class II to a Class I recommendation. The recommendations have gone from it is “reasonable” to do an ablation in Afib patients undergoing major types of structural heart surgery to it is “recommended” to do an ablation.
2017
A milestone was reached as AtriCure surpassed 100,000 AtriClip LAA Exclusion System devices sold worldwide.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

ENABLE Medical’s first product was a pair of radiofrequency energized surgical scissors designed to harvest saphenous veins in cardiac bypass procedures, IMA harvesting, and general surgical applications.2000In November, AtriCure was established as an independent business focused on atrial fibrillation. ENABLE Medical provided contract development and manufacturing services to AtriCure.2001The AtriCure bipolar ablation system was cleared by the U.S. FDA for the ablation of soft tissues.2002The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery published the first article on AtriCure devices--"Chronic Transmural Atrial Ablation by Using Bipolar Radiofrequency Energy on the Beating Heart." The article was authored by Sunil M. Prasad, M.D., Hersh S. Maniar, M.D., Richard B. Schuessler, Ph.D., and Ralph J. Damiano, Jr., M.D.2005On August, 5, 2005, AtriCure became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.

I interviewed at AtriCure (Blaine, MN) in June 2016.InterviewPhone interview with human resources, casual in person interview with CEO and phone interview with hiring manager.Typical questions from HR (walked through resume, why did I leave, what did I like/not like about the positions, what did my team look like, etc). Meeting with CEO was a chance to ask him questions and hear about his vision for the company. Those parts of the interview process were great.Interview Questions Background: I went back to school late in life and already had many years in the industry before getting my undergrad degree.

 The ATLAS study just reached a milestone by enrolling it’s 300 subject today! We initially launched this study in 2016 and it’s currently active in 17 different sites. 
The objectives of the study are to:
1.	Compare impact of POAF among two randomized treatment arms; patients with POAF and surgical LAA closure (using AtriClip Gillinov-Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems) versus patients with POAF and no surgical LAA closure.
2.	Evaluate Healthcare resource utilization [i.e. Hospital length of stay (LOS), emergency room and/or hospital re-admissions, and costs associated with specific adverse events that may be related to atrial fibrillation]. 
The target population for this study are patients without a documented history of Afib (AF) who are undergoing structural heart procedure and are at a high risk of developing post-operative AF (POAF) and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events.
