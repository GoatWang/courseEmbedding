	2. The

	Legal Proceedings


	Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company


	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS, or collectively with
	its subsidiaries, "the Company") was formed in November 1996. NFS is the holding company for Nationwide Life Insurance Company (NLIC), Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company (NLAIC) and other companies that comprise the life insurance and
	retirement savings operations of the Nationwide group of companies (Nationwide). This group includes Nationwide Financial Network (NFN), an affiliated distribution network that markets directly to its customer base. NFS is incorporated in Delaware
	and maintains its principal executive offices in Columbus, Ohio.


	The Company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in
	the ordinary course of its business. The Company's legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the Company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the Company operates. These
	matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcomes cannot be predicted. Regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the Company's litigation matters. Furthermore, it is often
	not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty. Some matters, including certain of those referred to
	below, are in very preliminary stages, and the Company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs' claims for liability or damages. In some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions, the court has not
	yet decided whether a class will be certified or (in the event of certification) the size of the class and class period. In many of the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief, including punitive damages and
	equitable remedies, which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available. The Company believes, however, that based on currently known information, the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and
	regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability
	of litigation, it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the Company's condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period.


	The various businesses conducted by the Company are subject to
	oversight by numerous federal and state regulatory entities, including but not limited to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and state insurance
	authorities. Such regulatory entities may, in the normal course, be engaged in general or targeted inquiries, examinations and investigations of the Company and/or its




	PROS-0272













	affiliates. The financial services industry has been the subject of
	increasing scrutiny in connection with a broad spectrum of regulatory issues; with respect to all such scrutiny directed at the Company and/or its affiliates, the Company is cooperating with regulators. The Company will cooperate with Nationwide
	Mutual Insurance Company (NMIC) insofar as any inquiry, examination or investigation encompasses NMIC's operations.


	On August 15, 2001, NFS and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed
	in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled

	Lou Haddock, as trustee of the Flyte Tool & Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services, Inc.
	and Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. On November 18, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a sixth amended complaint amending the list of named plaintiffs and claiming to represent a class of qualified retirement plan trustees under the Employee
	Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that purchased variable annuities from NLIC. The plaintiffs allege that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity contracts and that NLIC and NFS breached ERISA fiduciary duties by
	allegedly accepting service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks disgorgement of some or all of the payments allegedly received by NFS and NLIC, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and
	attorneys' fees. On November 6, 2009, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On October 21, 2010, the District Court dismissed NFS from the lawsuit. On February 6, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the
	November 6, 2009 order granting class certification and remanded the case back to the District Court for further consideration. On September 6, 2013, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. NLIC filed a motion for
	summary judgment on March 17, 2014. Oral argument on the motion for summary judgment is scheduled for July 11, 2014. The case is set for trial beginning February 9, 2015. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.


	On November 20, 2007, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc.
	(NRS) and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Ruth A. Gwin and Sandra H. Turner, and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance
	Company, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	. On March 12, 2010, NRS and NLIC were named in a Second Amended Class Action Complaint filed in the Circuit
	Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Steven E. Coker, Sandra H. Turner, David N. Lichtenstein and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Nationwide Retirement
	Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, Inc., PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	claiming to represent a class of all participants in the Alabama State Employees Association, Inc. (ASEA) Plan, excluding members of the
	Deferred Compensation Committee, ASEA's directors, officers and board members, and PEBCO's directors, officers and board members. On October 22, 2010, the parties to this action executed a court approved stipulation of settlement that agreed to
	certify a class for settlement purposes only, that provided for payments to the settlement class, and that provided for releases, certain bar orders, and dismissal of the case. The settlement fund has been paid out. On December 6, 2011, the Court
	entered an Order that NRS owed indemnification to ASEA and PEBCO for only the Coker (Gwin) class action, and dismissed NLIC. The Company resolved the indemnification claims of ASEA. On February 15, 2013, the Court issued its Order determining the
	amount of fees due to PEBCO on its indemnification claim. On March 28, 2014, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial Court decision awarding PEBCO its attorney fees and remanded the case back to the trial court to enter a judgment in favor of
	NRS. PEBCOs counsel has asked the court to reconsider its decision. NRS continues to defend this case vigorously.


	Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Debtors) and Giddens, James v
	NLIC and NMIC, et al.



	In 2012 the Plaintiff, Debtor in Possession Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc., filed a class action in the United States Bankruptcy
	Court for the Southern District of New York seeking the recovery of certain assets from approximately 200 defendants, including NLIC and NMIC (the "Distributed Action"). The claims against NLIC and NMIC arise from the bankruptcy filings in 2008 of
	the Plaintiff and its parent company, Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc., which triggered the early termination of two collateralized debt obligation transactions, resulting in payments to NLIC and NMIC. The Plaintiff seeks to have certain sums returned
	to the bankruptcy estate in addition to prejudgment interest and costs. The case is currently stayed. In 2013, Plaintiff sent correspondence to all defendants inviting settlement discussions and has served NMIC and NLIC with a "SPV Derivatives ADR
	Notice," formally starting the Alternative Dispute Resolution process. NMIC and NLIC have responded, and are currently taking part in the ADR process. On January 10, 2014, Lehman filed a final motion to extend the stay, which continues to be in
	effect. On May 14, 2014, the court held a hearing on a scheduling order governing the Distributed Action. The parties are continuing to negotiate the proposed scheduling order prior to submission to the court. On July 17, 2014, the parties reached a
	settlement of this matter. The settlement paperwork is currently being prepared.

Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional, contact Nationwide or click links to product information below.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

General
  Information and History
�
The
  Nationwide Variable Account-II is a separate investment account of Nationwide
  Life Insurance Company ("Nationwide"). Nationwide is a member of the Nationwide
  group of companies. All of Nationwide's common stock is owned by Nationwide
  Financial Services, Inc. ("NFS"), a holding company. NFS has two classes of
  common stock outstanding with different voting rights enabling Nationwide
  Corporation (the holder of all of the outstanding Class B Common Stock) to
  control NFS. Nationwide Corporation is a holding company, as well. All of its
  common stock is held by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (95.2%) and
  Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (4.8%), the ultimate controlling
  persons of the Nationwide group of companies. The Nationwide group of companies
  is one of America�s largest insurance and financial services family of
  companies, with combined assets of over $158 billion as of December 31,
2005.
�
Services
�
Nationwide,
  which has responsibility for administration of the contracts and the variable
  account, maintains records of the name, address, taxpayer identification number,
  and other pertinent information for each contract owner and the number and
  type
  of contract issued to each contract owner and records with respect to the
  contract value.
�
The
  custodian of the assets of the variable account is Nationwide. Nationwide will
  maintain a record of all purchases and redemptions of shares of the underlying
  mutual funds. Nationwide, or affiliates of Nationwide, may have entered into
  agreements with either the investment adviser or distributor for the underlying
  mutual funds. The agreements relate to administrative services furnished by
  Nationwide or an affiliate of Nationwide. Some of the services provided include
  distribution of underlying fund prospectuses, semi-annual and annual fund
  reports, proxy materials and fund communications, as well as maintaining the
  websites and voice response systems necessary for contract owners to execute
  trades in the funds. Nationwide also acts as a limited agent for the fund for
  purposes of accepting the trades. For these services the funds agree to pay
  Nationwide an annual fee based on the average aggregate net assets of the
  variable account (and other separate accounts of Nationwide or life insurance
  company subsidiaries of Nationwide) invested in the particular fund.

�
Nationwide
  takes these anticipated fee payments into consideration when it determines
  the
  charges that will be assessed under the contracts. Without these payments,
  contract charges would be higher. Only those underlying mutual funds that agree
  to pay Nationwide a fee will be offered in the contract. Generally, Nationwide
  expects to receive somewhere between 0.10% to 0.45% (an annualized rate of
  the
  daily net assets of the variable account) from the funds it offers in the
  contracts. What is actually received depends upon many factors, including but
  not limited to the type of fund (i.e., money market funds generally pay less
  revenue than other fund types) and the actual services rendered to the fund
  company. Nationwide does not consider these fee payments when determining fund
  availability associated with any of the optional benefits offered in the
  contract.
�
Distribution,
  Promotional, and Sales Expenses
�
In
  addition to or partially in lieu of commission, Nationwide may pay the selling
  firms a marketing allowance, which is based on the firm�s ability and
  demonstrated willingness to promote and market Nationwide's products. How any
  marketing allowance is spent is determined by the firm, but generally will
  be
  used to finance firm activities, such as training and education, that may
  contribute to the promotion and marketing of Nationwide's products. Nationwide
  makes certain assumptions about the amount of marketing allowance it will pay
  and takes these assumptions into consideration when it determines the charges
  that will be assessed under the contracts. For the contracts described in the
  prospectus, Nationwide assumed 0.50% (of the daily net assets of the variable
  account) for marketing allowance when determining the charges for the contracts.
  The actual amount of the marketing allowance may be higher or lower than this
  assumption. If the actual amount of marketing allowance paid is more than what
  was assumed, Nationwide will fund the 
�
�
�

















difference.
  Nationwide generally does not profit from any excess marketing allowance if
  the
  amount assumed was higher than what is actually paid. Any excess would be spent
  on additional marketing for the contracts. For more information about marketing
  allowance or how a particular selling firm uses marketing allowances, please
  consult with your registered representative.

  of broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 who

  ("NASD").

�
�
Item
  28.�Indemnification
�
Provision
  is made in Nationwide�s Amended and Restated Code of Regulations and expressly
  authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio, for
  indemnification by Nationwide of any person who was or is a party or is
  threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
  suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
  by
  reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee
  of
  Nationwide, against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and
  amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person
  in
  connection with such action, suit or proceeding, to the extent and under the
  circumstances permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
  Ohio.
�
Insofar
  as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933
  ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling
  Nationwide pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Nationwide has been informed
  that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
  indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
  therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
  such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
  or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
  successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
  director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
  registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
  has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
  jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
  policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication
  of
  such issue.

Friday, 16 March 2001 08:00
No-Action Letter under:
Securities Act of 1933 –
Section 5
Nationwide Life Insurance Company
March 16, 2001



RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF
INSURANCE PRODUCTS
DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
Nationwide Life Insurance Company, et al.



By letter dated March 15, 2001, you request assurance that the staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission based upon the manner in which Nationwide Life Insurance Company and its affiliate, Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, (collectively, “Nationwide”) will disclose accumulation unit value information in the prospectuses for certain variable annuity contracts issued by Nationwide.
Your letter states that Nationwide offers variable annuity contracts through various registered separate accounts (“Nationwide Separate Accounts”). Each Nationwide Separate Account is registered as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940 on Form N-4, and the variable annuity contracts issued through each Nationwide Separate Account are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, also on Form N-4.
You state that various benefits under certain of the variable annuity contracts issued through the Nationwide Separate Accounts are “unbundled,” meaning that they are offered as optional features. If an investor selects one of these optional features, a specific charge is added to the basic contract charge that the investor pays and is assessed against the assets of the Nationwide Separate Account in question. These optional features include enhanced death benefits, deferred sales load waivers, guaranteed minimum income benefits, and a bonus on purchase payments made in the first contract year.
You state that the unbundling of contract features allows investors, with the aid of their financial advisers, to tailor individual variable annuity contracts to their specific financial needs and objectives, and to avoid charges associated with unwanted features by selecting only those features consistent with their specific financial objectives. You also state that the specific linkage of particular benefits with specific charges allows investors to assess the costs and benefits of an optional benefit more precisely.
You state that a contract owner may select one or more of these optional features, in a variety of combinations, resulting in numerous possible combinations of contract charges. You also state that Nationwide maintains a separate class of accumulation units for each such combination of charges. You claim that, as a result, the prospectus disclosure required by Item 4 of Form N-4 for each class of accumulation units can result in extensive unit value information that overwhelms the reader. For example, in the May 2000 prospectus for one Nationwide variable annuity contract, 180 out of the 252 pages of the prospectus are devoted to the accumulation unit value tables required by Item 4 of Form N-4. Further, you estimate that 150 additional pages will be required to display similar information for the May 2001 prospectus for this particular contract, with the result that the accumulation unit value information required by Item 4 will take up approximately 82% of the prospectus.
You propose that, with respect to each variable annuity contract offered through a Nationwide Separate Account, Nationwide will include in the prospectus for the contract the information required by Item 4(a) of Form N-4 only with respect to two classes of accumulation units. In particular, one class of unit values will depict the highest possible combination of contract charges and will be shown for each available underlying mutual fund; the other class of unit values will depict the lowest possible contract charges and will also be shown for each available underlying mutual fund. Nationwide will include classes of accumulation units that reflect combinations of charges between the highest and lowest possible charges in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI). All of the accumulation unit value tables in the prospectus and the SAI will comply with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4. As a result, the prospectus and SAI together will contain all accumulation unit value information as required by Item 4 of Form N-4.
You represent that plain English disclosure accompanying the accumulation unit value tables in the prospectus will explain that the two classes of accumulation unit values represent the highest and lowest possible contract charge combinations, and that the SAI, which is available upon request without charge, contains the unit values for all other possible combinations of charges. You represent that this accompanying disclosure will include a toll-free telephone number for investors to call to request an SAI. You represent that this disclosure may also include alternative means of obtaining an SAI, such as addresses enabling investors to send a written request for an SAI, or web site information for investors who wish to access the SAI electronically. You also represent that plain English disclosure accompanying the accumulation unit values in the SAI will make clear that accumulation unit values reflecting the highest and lowest combination of contract charges are contained in the prospectus.
In addition, you represent that Nationwide provides a quarterly statement to each individual contract owner. These statements disclose, with respect to each class of accumulation units held by the contract owner, the unit value and number of units held at the beginning of the quarter, the number and value of units purchased and sold during the quarter, and the unit value and number of units held at the end of the quarter.
Item 4(a) of Form N-4 requires that, for each class of accumulation units, a variable annuity separate account must furnish a table that includes the accumulation unit value at the beginning of the period, the accumulation unit value at the end of the period, and the number of accumulation units outstanding at the end of the period for each of the last ten fiscal years, or for the life of the separate account if less than ten years. You argue that strict adherence to Item 4 of Form N-4 will result in prospectuses that are inconsistent with the Commission’s recent initiatives requiring prospectuses to be written in plain English.1 In particular, you note that, for any individual investor, only one combination of contract charges, and one class of accumulation unit values, will be relevant. You state that the remaining accumulation unit value tables, which may take up hundreds of pages, must be considered extraneous with respect to each individual investor. In addition, you argue that the costs of producing, printing, and disseminating these accumulation unit value tables impose burdens that are disproportionate to any regulatory purpose, and that these costs will ultimately be passed on to investors.
In our view, your proposal is consistent with the Commission’s efforts to improve prospectuses.2 The disclosure necessary to satisfy Item 4(a) becomes more lengthy as a variable annuity contract adds multiple classes of accumulation units, each of which corresponds to a different combination of charges available under the contract. As you point out, only the accumulation unit values that correspond to the combination of contract charges that will actually be paid by a particular investor are directly relevant to that investor.
Based on the representations in your letter, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if the prospectus for each of Nationwide’s variable annuity contracts includes the information required by Item 4(a) of Form N-4 only with respect to the classes of accumulation units corresponding to the highest and lowest combination of charges available under the contract. This disclosure would provide investors with information about accumulation unit values in a concise manner that will not distract the investor’s attention from the other material information in the prospectus. Our conclusion is based in particular on the representations that:
(1) accumulation unit value tables that comply with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4 for all classes of accumulation units available under the contract that are not shown in the prospectus will be included in the SAI, and these tables will be accompanied by plain English disclosure making clear that accumulation unit values reflecting the highest and lowest combination of contract charges are contained in the prospectus;
(2) the prospectus will include plain English disclosure accompanying the tables for the two classes of accumulation units shown, explaining that these two classes of units have values representing the highest and lowest possible contract charge combinations, and that tables for all other classes of accumulation units, corresponding to all other possible combinations of contract charges, are included in the SAI, which is available without charge upon request through a toll-free telephone number; and
(3) Nationwide provides a quarterly statement to each individual contract owner that discloses, with respect to each class of accumulation units held by the contract owner, the unit value and number of units held at the beginning of the quarter, the number and value of units purchased and sold during the quarter, and the unit value and number of units held at the end of the quarter.
Because our position is based on the facts and representations set forth in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.

Senior Special Counsel
Incoming Letter:
March 15, 2001
William J. Kotapish, Esquire
Assistant Director
Office of Insurance Products
Division of Investment Management
United States Securities and Exchange Commission
Judiciary Plaza
450 Fifth Street NW
Washington, D.C. 20549
Dear Mr. Kotapish:
I am writing on behalf of Nationwide Life Insurance Company (“NWL”), its affiliate, Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company (“NLAIC”), and various NWL and NLAIC (collectively, “Nationwide”) separate accounts, all of which are registered as unit investment trusts under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and offer variable annuity contracts registered under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form N-4.
The purpose of this letter is to request assurance from the staff (the “Staff”) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that it will not recommend enforcement action in connection with the manner in which Nationwide proposes to depict condensed financial information in certain variable annuity prospectuses pursuant to Item 4 of Form N-4.3 Form N-4, as you know, is the prescribed form for insurance company separate accounts/unit investment trusts offering variable annuity contracts that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”).
Nationwide generally believes that continued adherence to the strict, technical directives of the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4 is unwarranted in some cases and may in fact be inconsistent with the policies embodied in the “plain English” initiative and the adoption of Rule 421 under the Securities Act of 1933. Nationwide also believes that the alternative mode of presentation it proposes for presenting condensed financial information comports favorably with the informational needs and interests of investors without compromising or frustrating any regulatory purpose.
Background 
NWL and NLAIC are stock life insurance companies organized under Ohio law. NWL is licensed to do business in all fifty states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. NLAIC is licensed to do business in 47 states. NWL is wholly owned by Nationwide Financial Services, Inc., a holding company. NLAIC is wholly owned by NWL.
Nationwide, through its registered separate accounts, has been an issuer of variable annuity contracts for more than twenty years. Over the last three years, Nationwide has embraced the practice of modularizing or “unbundling” various benefits within its variable annuity offerings. In the simplest terms, “unbundling” allows for the offering of a basic variable annuity contract along with an array of optional benefits. Each of these optional features or benefits, when elected, is provided for a specific charge that is added to basic contract charges and assessed against the assets of the separate account in question.
Nationwide believes this allows consumers, with the aid of their financial advisers, to tailor individual variable annuity contracts to their specific financial needs and objectives. Moreover, by selecting only those benefits or features consistent with specific financial objectives, charges associated with unwanted benefits or features are avoided. Finally, the specific linkage of particular benefits with specific charges allows consumers to assess the costs and benefits of the optional benefit more precisely. Nationwide believes this attribute of “unbundling” is particularly desirable with respect to certain benefits, such as extra credit or “bonus” provisions. The optional benefits offered in Nationwide variable annuity products include, among other things, enhanced death benefits, deferred sales load waivers, guaranteed minimum income benefits, and, more recently, a 3% “extra credit” or bonus on first year purchase payments.4
Although many Nationwide variable annuity investors select no optional benefits or only one optional benefit, the options that are available are generally not mutually exclusive and may be used together in a variety of combinations. Since there are many different options to choose from, each having a distinct charge, there are numerous possible combinations of contract charges as well.
Operationally, Nationwide is able to account for each specific combination of contract charges through the systematic maintenance of a distinct unit value with respect to each combination. Accordingly, for each underlying mutual fund, a separate class of accumulation units associated with each possible combination of contract charges is maintained. While this allows Nationwide to administer the operation of the contracts effectively, the reproduction of this unit value information in tabular format for purposes of complying with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4 can create results that appear to be wholly unintended and of dubious value for consumers.
Specifically, the Instructions to Item 4 require the tabular depiction of each class of unit values at the beginning of the period, the end of the period, as well as the number of units outstanding at the end of the period for each of the last ten fiscal years of the registrant. In a prospectus for an unbundled variable annuity contract, the Instructions to Item 4 can result in extensive unit value information that overwhelms the reader. For example, in the May 2000 prospectus of one Nationwide variable annuity product offering, 71% of the printed prospectus (180 of 252 pages) is devoted to compliance with the technical requirements of Item 4. 5 Conservatively, an estimated 150 additional pages will be required to display similar information for the May 2001 prospectus for this particular product, meaning that approximately 82% of the prospectus will consist of page-after-page (roughly 330 in number) of accumulation unit value information presented to comply with Item 4.
Nationwide’s Proposed Alternative 
In lieu of reproducing page-after-page of accumulation unit value data (only a small portion of which will be relevant for purposes of any individual investor) for inclusion in its prospectuses, Nationwide proposes to depict only two classes of unit values: one reflecting the highest possible combination of contract charges, the other reflecting the lowest possible combination of contract charges. In particular, one class of unit values will depict the highest possible combination of contract charges and will be shown for each available underlying mutual fund; the other class of unit values will depict the lowest possible contract charges and will also be shown for each available underlying mutual fund.
Both classes of unit values will be shown in conformity with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4, including the following. This information will be presented in tabular format and will show for each underlying mutual fund the accumulation unit value at the beginning of the period, accumulation unit value at the end of the period, and the number of units outstanding at the end of the period. Both classes of accumulation unit value information will be presented for each of the last ten fiscal years (or the life of the registrant-separate account, if less).
For classes of accumulation units that reflect combinations of contract charges between the two extremes, Nationwide proposes to include all such data within the Statement of Additional Information, shown in conformity with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4. These tables in the Statement of Additional Information will be accompanied by “plain English” disclosure that accumulation unit values reflecting the highest and lowest combination of contract charges are contained in the prospectus. Accordingly, within the prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information, all accumulation unit value information will be set forth and made available as required by Item 4 of Form N-4.
In the prospectus, along with the two classes of accumulation unit values representing the highest and lowest possible combination of contract charges, Nationwide proposes to include “plain English” disclosure, making it clear that the two classes of presented accumulation unit values represent the highest and lowest possible contract charge combinations, and that actual unit value information for any combination of charges between the two extremes is available within the Statement of Additional Information, which is available upon request without charge. This “plain English” disclosure will also include a toll free phone number for investors who wish to request a Statement of Additional Information. In addition, Nationwide may also include addresses, enabling investors to request a Statement of Additional Information in writing, or web site data for investors who wish to access the Statement of Additional Information electronically.
Analysis/Rationale
In summary, Nationwide believes that the advent of “unbundled” variable annuity product offerings was never contemplated when the current version of Form N-4 was adopted.6 In addition, continued strict adherence to the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4 will result in prospectus documents that are at odds with the precepts and policy underpinnings of the SEC’s “plain English” initiative and Rule 421. Though we recognize that this represents what amounts to a subjective viewpoint, Nationwide believes it is not unfair to conclude that most reasonable observers would concur with this judgment.
Form N-4 itself admonishes registrants to “avoid the use of excessive detail” and to respond to the items of Part A by being as “simple and as direct as possible and include only information needed to understand the fundamental characteristics of the registrants.”7 In many ways, this language, formulated nearly twenty years ago, precisely foreshadowed more recent Staff pronouncements in connection with the “plain English” initiative and Rule 421.
Our assumption, which apparently mirrors the SEC’s assumptions in adopting Rule 421,8 is that disclosure documents such as prospectuses should be made more inviting (and therefore more likely to be read and understood by investors) by presenting information succinctly without unnecessary repetition or undue emphasis on hyper-technical information. The kind of documents intended to be eradicated by Rule 421 are those which are, to the ordinary investor, highly technical and intrinsically intimidating. The task of making a variable annuity prospectus usable and readable (not to mention inviting) for a typical investor is, in our view, not consistent with the inclusion of hundreds of pages of accumulation unit value information.
While we recognize that Rule 421 was never intended to foster brevity per se, certainly not at the expense of completeness, we feel it is highly relevant that, for any individual investor (i.e., with one existing or prospective class of unit values), only one combination of contract charges, and thus one class of accumulation unit values, will have any relevance or meaning whatsoever. If all unit value information is required, there will be, in some cases, literally hundreds of pages of unit value data that must be considered extraneous with respect to each individual investor.
Indirectly, the SEC has previously recognized the undesirability of this set of circumstances. In its proposing release for Form N-6 (the proposed form for variable life insurance registration),9 the SEC specifically declined to include condensed financial information requirements (similar to Form N-4) as a part of form N-6, stating that “because of the individualized nature of variable life insurance charges, such as cost of insurance, there does not appear to be a comparable measure of performance that is applicable to all holders of a particular variable life insurance policy.” The practice of unbundling has the effect of individualizing annuity contract pricing in the same way variable life policies are individually priced.
In addition to the foregoing, the cost of producing, printing, and disseminating this extraneous information to prospective and existing contract holders presents Nationwide with economic burdens that are, in our view, disproportionate to any remaining regulatory purpose that may be served. As with virtually any business, these expenses will ultimately, in some form, be passed on to consumers and will be reflected in the pricing of future products and benefits.
Moreover, the extra expense and the burden of producing this extraneous information puts Nationwide at a competitive disadvantage versus certain competitors. Although there may be no variable annuity issuers which have utilized the practice of “unbundling” to the extent Nationwide has, many other insurance companies offer optional benefit with pricing differentials. Many of these companies assess the same kinds of asset-based fees as Nationwide, but deduct them through the periodic cancellation of units rather than through the maintenance of unique unit values. Though the net result to consumers is the same, Nationwide is required to present alternative accumulation unit value information in its prospectuses while other companies, which achieve precisely the same result through slightly different means, have no similar obligation.
Finally, we believe also that Nationwide’s proposed alternative is consistent with a recent SEC proposal to parse out in a more accessible format another category of potentially voluminous financial information related to variable contracts. Specifically, the SEC proposed to require fee tables in variable life insurance prospectuses to show underlying fund charges only for the least and most expensive funds. This approach will allow an investor to review the range of fund charges for a contract, and then, if more detailed information is desired, access underlying fund prospectuses for information concerning each fund’s charges. The SEC proposed this approach because it concluded that investors would be overwhelmed by information of limited relevance if the fees and charges for each portfolio company were separately delineated in the fee table.10
Conclusion 
In summary, we request assurance that the Staff will not recommend enforcement action to the SEC if, in response to Item 4 of Form N-4, Nationwide provides in prospectuses used in the offer and sale of “unbundled” variable annuity contracts information for two classes of accumulation unit values only: one reflecting the highest possible combination of contract charges, the other reflecting the lowest possible charges.
We believe this proposal, as described herein, provides quick and convenient access to all accumulation unit value information, and serves the interests of investors (by providing ready access to any possible accumulation unit value) and Nationwide. We also believe our proposal is thoroughly consistent with other Part A information required on Form N-4. Specifically, example numbers and standardized performance information are required to reflect the highest possible contract fee/charge scenario, as will our proposal which includes the presentation of unit values reflecting the highest possible contract charges.
Finally, we believe our proposal should be considered in light of the information provided on a routine basis by Nationwide to current contract holders. For example, Nationwide provides quarterly statements that contain unit value information that is unique to each individual contract holder. In other words, every three months, every Nationwide contract holder is provided with specific information regarding his or her accumulation units and unit values. This information includes, with respect to each class of accumulation units held by the contract owner, the number of units owned and the unit value for each underlying mutual fund at the beginning and end of the quarter, as well as the number and value of units that were purchased or sold during the quarter.
We greatly appreciate your consideration of our proposal and the opportunity to share our views on this subject. If you have any questions, please contact Heather Harker at 614-249-0075 or the undersigned at 614-249-8537.

“Unbundling” is now a widespread practice within the variable annuity industry, and even though most of the benefits Nationwide has unbundled are representative of industry practice generally, virtually any type of benefit can be “unbundled.” Because of the advantages associated with unbundling, we believe the practice of unbundling will continue to expand.

According to the proposing release for Form N-4 (Investment Company Act Release 13689 – January 5, 1984), the original purpose for inclusion of condensed financial information in From N-4 was to “increase the comparability of management account [registered on form N-3] and trust account prospectuses.”

  28.����������Indemnification
�
Provision
  is made in Nationwide�s Amended and Restated Code of Regulations and expressly
  authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio, for
  indemnification by Nationwide of any person who was or is a party or is
  threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
  suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
  by
  reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee
  of
  Nationwide, against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and
  amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person
  in
  connection with such action, suit or proceeding, to the extent and under the
  circumstances permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
  Ohio.
�
Insofar
  as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933
  ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling
  Nationwide pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Nationwide has been informed
  that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
  indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
  therefore, unenforceable.��In the event that a claim for
  indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
  registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
  person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
  proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
  connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless
  in
  the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
  submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
  indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
  will
  be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Nationwide Life Insurance Company, et al.: No-Action Letter dated March 16, 2001 















Home | Previous Page





























 
No-Action Letter under:Securities Act of 1933 - Section 5
Nationwide Life Insurance Company
March 16, 2001     



RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF    
INSURANCE PRODUCTS 
DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
 Nationwide Life Insurance Company, et al.
By letter dated March 15, 2001, you request assurance that the staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission based upon the manner in which Nationwide Life Insurance Company and its affiliate, Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, (collectively, "Nationwide") will disclose accumulation unit value information in the prospectuses for certain variable annuity contracts issued by Nationwide.

  Your letter states that Nationwide offers variable annuity contracts through various registered separate accounts ("Nationwide Separate Accounts").  Each Nationwide Separate Account is registered as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940 on Form N-4, and the variable annuity contracts issued through each Nationwide Separate Account are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, also on Form N-4.  

  You state that various benefits under certain of the variable annuity contracts issued through the Nationwide Separate Accounts are "unbundled," meaning that they are offered as optional features.  If an investor selects one of these optional features, a specific charge is added to the basic contract charge that the investor pays and is assessed against the assets of the Nationwide Separate Account in question.  These optional features include enhanced death benefits, deferred sales load waivers, guaranteed minimum income benefits, and a bonus on purchase payments made in the first contract year.

  You state that the unbundling of contract features allows investors, with the aid of their financial advisers, to tailor individual variable annuity contracts to their specific financial needs and objectives, and to avoid charges associated with unwanted features by selecting only those features consistent with their specific financial objectives.  You also state that the specific linkage of particular benefits with specific charges allows investors to assess the costs and benefits of an optional benefit more precisely.  

  You state that a contract owner may select one or more of these optional features, in a variety of combinations, resulting in numerous possible combinations of contract charges.  You also state that Nationwide maintains a separate class of accumulation units for each such combination of charges.  You claim that, as a result, the prospectus disclosure required by Item 4 of Form N-4 for each class of accumulation units can result in extensive unit value information that overwhelms the reader.  For example, in the May 2000 prospectus for one Nationwide variable annuity contract, 180 out of the 252 pages of the prospectus are devoted to the accumulation unit value tables required by Item 4 of Form N-4.  Further, you estimate that 150 additional pages will be required to display similar information for the May 2001 prospectus for this particular contract, with the result that the accumulation unit value information required by Item 4 will take up approximately 82% of the prospectus.

  You propose that, with respect to each variable annuity contract offered through a Nationwide Separate Account, Nationwide will include in the prospectus for the contract the information required by Item 4(a) of Form N-4 only with respect to two classes of accumulation units.  In particular, one class of unit values will depict the highest possible combination of contract charges and will be shown for each available underlying mutual fund; the other class of unit values will depict the lowest possible contract charges and will also be shown for each available underlying mutual fund.  Nationwide will include classes of accumulation units that reflect combinations of charges between the highest and lowest possible charges in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI).  All of the accumulation unit value tables in the prospectus and the SAI will comply with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4.  As a result, the prospectus and SAI together will contain all accumulation unit value information as required by Item 4 of Form N-4. 

You represent that plain English disclosure accompanying the accumulation unit value tables in the prospectus will explain that the two classes of accumulation unit values represent the highest and lowest possible contract charge combinations, and that the SAI, which is available upon request without charge, contains the unit values for all other possible combinations of charges.  You represent that this accompanying disclosure will include a toll-free telephone number for investors to call to request an SAI.  You represent that this disclosure may also include alternative means of obtaining an SAI, such as addresses enabling investors to send a written request for an SAI, or web site information for investors who wish to access the SAI electronically.  You also represent that plain English disclosure accompanying the accumulation unit values in the SAI will make clear that accumulation unit values reflecting the highest and lowest combination of contract charges are contained in the prospectus.  

In addition, you represent that Nationwide provides a quarterly statement to each individual contract owner.  These statements disclose, with respect to each class of accumulation units held by the contract owner, the unit value and number of units held at the beginning of the quarter, the number and value of units purchased and sold during the quarter, and the unit value and number of units held at the end of the quarter.  

  Item 4(a) of Form N-4 requires that, for each class of accumulation units, a variable annuity separate account must furnish a table that includes the accumulation unit value at the beginning of the period, the accumulation unit value at the end of the period, and the number of accumulation units outstanding at the end of the period for each of the last ten fiscal years, or for the life of the separate account if less than ten years.  You argue that strict adherence to Item 4 of Form N-4 will result in prospectuses that are inconsistent with the Commission's recent initiatives requiring prospectuses to be written in plain English.1  In particular, you note that, for any individual investor, only one combination of contract charges, and one class of accumulation unit values, will be relevant.  You state that the remaining accumulation unit value tables, which may take up hundreds of pages, must be considered extraneous with respect to each individual investor.  In addition, you argue that the costs of producing, printing, and disseminating these accumulation unit value tables impose burdens that are disproportionate to any regulatory purpose, and that these costs will ultimately be passed on to investors.

  In our view, your proposal is consistent with the Commission's efforts to improve prospectuses.2  The disclosure necessary to satisfy Item 4(a) becomes more lengthy as a variable annuity contract adds multiple classes of accumulation units, each of which corresponds to a different combination of charges available under the contract.  As you point out, only the accumulation unit values that correspond to the combination of contract charges that will actually be paid by a particular investor are directly relevant to that investor.    

Based on the representations in your letter, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if the prospectus for each of Nationwide's variable annuity contracts includes the information required by Item 4(a) of Form N-4 only with respect to the classes of accumulation units corresponding to the highest and lowest combination of charges available under the contract.  This disclosure would provide investors with information about accumulation unit values in a concise manner that will not distract the investor's attention from the other material information in the prospectus.  Our conclusion is based in particular on the representations that:

(1)   accumulation unit value tables that comply with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4 for all classes of accumulation units available under the contract that are not shown in the prospectus will be included in the SAI, and these tables will be accompanied by plain English disclosure making  clear that accumulation unit values reflecting the highest and lowest combination of contract charges are contained in the prospectus;

(2)   the prospectus will include plain English disclosure accompanying the tables for the two classes of accumulation units shown, explaining that these two classes of units have values representing the highest and lowest possible contract charge combinations, and that tables for all other classes of accumulation units, corresponding to all other possible combinations of contract charges, are included in the SAI, which is available without charge upon request through a toll-free telephone number; and 

(3)   Nationwide provides a quarterly statement to each individual contract owner that discloses, with respect to each class of accumulation units held by the contract owner, the unit value and number of units held at the beginning of the quarter, the number and value of units purchased and sold during the quarter, and the unit value and number of units held at the end of the quarter.

Because our position is based on the facts and representations set forth in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.

Incoming Letter:
March 15, 2001

William J. Kotapish, Esquire
Assistant Director
Office of Insurance Products
Division of Investment Management
United States Securities and Exchange Commission
Judiciary Plaza
450 Fifth Street NW
Washington, D.C. 20549


Dear Mr. Kotapish:

I am writing on behalf of Nationwide Life Insurance Company ("NWL"), its affiliate, Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company ("NLAIC"), and various NWL and NLAIC (collectively, "Nationwide") separate accounts, all of which are registered as unit investment trusts under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and offer variable annuity contracts registered under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form N-4. 

The purpose of this letter is to request assurance from the staff (the "Staff") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") that it will not recommend enforcement action in connection with the manner in which Nationwide proposes to depict condensed financial information in certain variable annuity prospectuses pursuant to Item 4 of Form N-4.3  Form N-4, as you know, is the prescribed form for insurance company separate accounts/unit investment trusts offering variable annuity contracts that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940  (the "1940 Act") and the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act").

Nationwide generally believes that continued adherence to the strict, technical directives of the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4 is unwarranted in some cases and may in fact be inconsistent with the policies embodied in the "plain English" initiative and the adoption of Rule 421 under the Securities Act of 1933. Nationwide also believes that the alternative mode of presentation it proposes for presenting condensed financial information comports favorably with the informational needs and interests of investors without compromising or frustrating any regulatory purpose.

Background  
NWL and NLAIC are stock life insurance companies organized under Ohio law.  NWL is licensed to do business in all fifty states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  NLAIC is licensed to do business in 47 states. NWL is wholly owned by Nationwide Financial Services, Inc., a holding company.  NLAIC is wholly owned by NWL.  

Nationwide, through its registered separate accounts, has been an issuer of variable annuity contracts for more than twenty years.  Over the last three years, Nationwide has embraced the practice of modularizing or "unbundling" various benefits within its variable annuity offerings.  In the simplest terms, "unbundling" allows for the offering of a basic variable annuity contract along with an array of optional benefits. Each of these optional features or benefits, when elected, is provided for a specific charge that is added to basic contract charges and assessed against the assets of the separate account in question.  

Nationwide believes this allows consumers, with the aid of their financial advisers, to tailor individual variable annuity contracts to their specific financial needs and objectives.  Moreover, by selecting only those benefits or features consistent with specific financial objectives, charges associated with unwanted benefits or features are avoided.  Finally, the specific linkage of particular benefits with specific charges allows consumers to assess the costs and benefits of the optional benefit more precisely. Nationwide believes this attribute of "unbundling" is particularly desirable with respect to certain benefits, such as extra credit or "bonus" provisions. The optional benefits offered in Nationwide variable annuity products include, among other things, enhanced death benefits, deferred sales load waivers, guaranteed minimum income benefits, and, more recently, a 3% "extra credit" or bonus on first year purchase payments.4
Although many Nationwide variable annuity investors select no optional benefits or only one optional benefit, the options that are available are generally not mutually exclusive and may be used together in a variety of combinations.  Since there are many different options to choose from, each having a distinct charge, there are numerous possible combinations of contract charges as well.    

Operationally, Nationwide is able to account for each specific combination of contract charges through the systematic maintenance of a distinct unit value with respect to each combination.  Accordingly, for each underlying mutual fund, a separate class of accumulation units associated with each possible combination of contract charges is maintained.  While this allows Nationwide to administer the operation of the contracts effectively, the reproduction of this unit value information in tabular format for purposes of complying with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4 can create results that appear to be wholly unintended and of dubious value for consumers. 

Specifically, the Instructions to Item 4 require the tabular depiction of each class of unit values at the beginning of the period, the end of the period, as well as the number of units outstanding at the end of the period for each of the last ten fiscal years of the registrant.   In a prospectus for an unbundled variable annuity contract, the Instructions to Item 4 can result in extensive unit value information that overwhelms the reader. For example, in the May 2000 prospectus of one Nationwide variable annuity product offering, 71% of the printed prospectus (180 of 252 pages) is devoted to compliance with the technical requirements of Item 4. 5 Conservatively, an estimated 150 additional pages will be required to display similar information for the May 2001 prospectus for this particular product, meaning that approximately 82% of the prospectus will consist of page-after-page (roughly 330 in number) of accumulation unit value information presented to comply with Item 4.  

Nationwide's Proposed Alternative 
In lieu of reproducing page-after-page of accumulation unit value data (only a small portion of which will be relevant for purposes of any individual investor) for inclusion in its prospectuses, Nationwide proposes to depict only two classes of unit values: one reflecting the highest possible combination of contract charges, the other reflecting the lowest possible combination of contract charges. In particular, one class of unit values will depict the highest possible combination of contract charges and will be shown for each available underlying mutual fund; the other class of unit values will depict the lowest possible contract charges and will also be shown for each available underlying mutual fund. 

Both classes of unit values will be shown in conformity with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4, including the following.  This information will be presented in tabular format and will show for each underlying mutual fund the accumulation unit value at the beginning of the period, accumulation unit value at the end of the period, and the number of units outstanding at the end of the period.  Both classes of accumulation unit value information will be presented for each of the last ten fiscal years (or the life of the registrant-separate account, if less).

For classes of accumulation units that reflect combinations of contract charges between the two extremes, Nationwide proposes to include all such data within the Statement of Additional Information, shown in conformity with the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4.  These tables in the Statement of Additional Information will be accompanied by "plain English" disclosure that accumulation unit values reflecting the highest and lowest combination of contract charges are contained in the prospectus. Accordingly, within the prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information, all accumulation unit value information will be set forth and made available as required by Item 4 of Form N-4.   

In the prospectus, along with the two classes of accumulation unit values representing the highest and lowest possible combination of contract charges, Nationwide proposes to include "plain English" disclosure, making it clear that the two classes of presented accumulation unit values represent the highest and lowest possible contract charge combinations, and that actual unit value information for any combination of charges between the two extremes is available within the Statement of Additional Information, which is available upon request without charge.  This "plain English" disclosure will also include a toll free phone number for investors who wish to request a Statement of Additional Information.  In addition, Nationwide may also include addresses, enabling investors to request a Statement of Additional Information in writing, or web site data for investors who wish to access the Statement of Additional Information electronically. 

Analysis/Rationale
In summary, Nationwide believes that the advent of "unbundled" variable annuity product offerings was never contemplated when the current version of Form N-4 was adopted.6  In addition, continued strict adherence to the Instructions to Item 4 of Form N-4 will result in prospectus documents that are at odds with the precepts and policy underpinnings of the SEC's "plain English" initiative and Rule 421. Though we recognize that this represents what amounts to a subjective viewpoint, Nationwide believes it is not unfair to conclude that most reasonable observers would concur with this judgment.

Form N-4 itself admonishes registrants to "avoid the use of excessive detail" and to respond to the items of Part A by being as "simple and as direct as possible and include only information needed to understand the fundamental characteristics of the registrants."7  In many ways, this language, formulated nearly twenty years ago, precisely foreshadowed more recent Staff pronouncements in connection with the "plain English" initiative and Rule 421.

Our assumption, which apparently mirrors the SEC's assumptions in adopting Rule 421,8 is that disclosure documents such as prospectuses should be made more inviting (and therefore more likely to be read and understood by investors) by presenting information succinctly without unnecessary repetition or undue emphasis on hyper-technical information. The kind of documents intended to be eradicated by Rule 421 are those which are, to the ordinary investor, highly technical and intrinsically intimidating.  The task of making a variable annuity prospectus usable and readable (not to mention inviting) for a typical investor is, in our view, not consistent with the inclusion of hundreds of pages of accumulation unit value information.

While we recognize that Rule 421 was never intended to foster brevity per se, certainly not at the expense of completeness, we feel it is highly relevant that, for any individual investor (i.e., with one existing or prospective class of unit values), only one combination of contract charges, and thus one class of accumulation unit values, will have any relevance or meaning whatsoever.  If all unit value information is required, there will be, in some cases, literally hundreds of pages of unit value data that must be considered extraneous with respect to each individual investor.   

Indirectly, the SEC has previously recognized the undesirability of this set of circumstances.  In its proposing release for Form N-6 (the proposed form for variable life insurance registration),9 the SEC specifically declined to include condensed financial information requirements (similar to Form N-4) as a part of form N-6, stating that "because of the individualized nature of variable life insurance charges, such as cost of insurance, there does not appear to be a comparable measure of performance that is applicable to all holders of a particular variable life insurance policy."   The practice of unbundling has the effect of individualizing annuity contract pricing in the same way variable life policies are individually priced.

In addition to the foregoing, the cost of producing, printing, and disseminating this extraneous information to prospective and existing contract holders presents Nationwide with economic burdens that are, in our view, disproportionate to any remaining regulatory purpose that may be served.  As with virtually any business, these expenses will ultimately, in some form, be passed on to consumers and will be reflected in the pricing of future products and benefits. 

Moreover, the extra expense and the burden of producing this extraneous information puts Nationwide at a competitive disadvantage versus certain competitors.  Although there may be no variable annuity issuers which have utilized the practice of "unbundling" to the extent Nationwide has, many other insurance companies offer optional benefit with pricing differentials.  Many of these companies assess the same kinds of asset-based fees as Nationwide, but deduct them through the periodic cancellation of units rather than through the maintenance of unique unit values.  Though the net result to consumers is the same, Nationwide is required to present alternative accumulation unit value information in its prospectuses while other companies, which achieve precisely the same result through slightly different means, have no similar obligation. 

Finally, we believe also that Nationwide's proposed alternative is consistent with a recent SEC proposal to parse out in a more accessible format another category of potentially voluminous financial information related to variable contracts.  Specifically, the SEC proposed to require fee tables in variable life insurance prospectuses to show underlying fund charges only for the least and most expensive funds.  This approach will allow an investor to review the range of fund charges for a contract, and then, if more detailed information is desired, access underlying fund prospectuses for information concerning each fund's charges.  The SEC proposed this approach because it concluded that investors would be overwhelmed by information of limited relevance if the fees and charges for each portfolio company were separately delineated in the fee table.10
Conclusion   
In summary, we request assurance that the Staff will not recommend enforcement action to the SEC if, in response to Item 4 of Form N-4, Nationwide provides in prospectuses used in the offer and sale of "unbundled" variable annuity contracts information for two classes of accumulation unit values only: one reflecting the highest possible combination of contract charges, the other reflecting the lowest possible charges. 

We believe this proposal, as described herein, provides quick and convenient access to all accumulation unit value information, and serves the interests of investors (by providing ready access to any possible accumulation unit value) and Nationwide. We also believe our proposal is thoroughly consistent with other Part A information required on Form N-4.  Specifically, example numbers and standardized performance information are required to reflect the highest possible contract fee/charge scenario, as will our proposal which includes the presentation of unit values reflecting the highest possible contract charges.   

Finally, we believe our proposal should be considered in light of the information provided on a routine basis by Nationwide to current contract holders.  For example, Nationwide provides quarterly statements that contain unit value information that is unique to each individual contract holder.  In other words, every three months, every Nationwide contract holder is provided with specific information regarding his or her accumulation units and unit values.  This information includes, with respect to each class of accumulation units held by the contract owner, the number of units owned and the unit value for each underlying mutual fund at the beginning and end of the quarter, as well as the number and value of units that were purchased or sold during the quarter.   

We greatly appreciate your consideration of our proposal and the opportunity to share our views on this subject.  If you have any questions, please contact Heather Harker at 614-249-0075 or the undersigned at 614-249-8537.

Sincerely yours,

Steven Savini, Esq.
Nationwide Life Insurance Company

4 "Unbundling" is now a widespread practice within the variable annuity industry, and even though most of the benefits Nationwide has unbundled are representative of industry practice generally, virtually any type of benefit can be "unbundled."  Because of the advantages associated with unbundling, we believe the practice of unbundling will continue to expand.

	Exhibit 10.39





	FUND AGREEMENT




	This Agreement dated as of the first day of October 1, 2002 is made by and among
	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (including any affiliates and/or subsidiaries listed on Exhibit A), Gartmore Mutual Fund Capital Trust, which serves as adviser, Gartmore Morley Capital Management, Inc., which serves as adviser, Gartmore
	Distribution Services, Inc., which services as distributor to Gartmore Mutual Fund (the Trust) and the Trusts mutual funds (the Funds). In this Agreement, Gartmore Mutual Fund Capital Trust, Gartmore Morley Capital
	Management, Inc., Gartmore Distribution Services, Inc., and Gartmore Mutual Funds are collectively referred to as Gartmore.




	WHEREAS, Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS) or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof (collectively referred to as NFS Affiliate/Subsidiary) provides administrative and/or recordkeeping services to variable
	contracts, which may include, but are not limited to, variable annuity contracts, variable life insurance policies and various retirements plans which meet the definition of retirement plans under Sections 401, 403 and 457 of the Internal Revenue
	Code (the Code) (collectively, Contracts); and




	WHEREAS, NFS Affiliate/Subsidiary may issue variable annuity
	contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate accounts (Variable Accounts) as listed on Exhibit A; and




	WHEREAS, the Contracts allow for the allocation of net amounts received by NFS to sub-accounts which correspond to each Fund for investment in shares of the Funds; and




	WHEREAS, selection of a particular sub-account is made by the contract owner or by participants in various types of retirement plans and such contract owners and/or participants may reallocate
	their investment options among the sub-accounts in accordance with the terms of the Contracts; and




	WHEREAS, NFS and Gartmore mutually desire the inclusion of the Funds as investment options for the Contracts; and




	NOW THEREFORE,
	NFS and Gartmore, in consideration of the promises and undertakings described herein, agree that the Funds will be available in products and services provided by NFS subject to the following:






	REPRESENTATIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS







	REPRESENTATIONS BY NFS





	NFS or an NFS Affiliate/Subsidiary agrees to perform certain administrative services
	(Services) as listed on Exhibit B




	NFS represents that the NFS Affiliates/Subsidiaries, including Variable Accounts, have been
	established and are in good standing under the state law in which they were organized. The Variable Accounts are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, unless otherwise exempt therefrom.




	NFS and its agents shall make no representations concerning the Funds or Fund shares except those contained in the Funds then current prospectuses,
	Statements of Additional Information or other documents produced by Gartmore (or an entity on its behalf) which contain information about the Funds. NFS agrees to allow a reasonable period of time for Gartmore to review any advertising and sales
	literature drafted by NFS (or agents on its behalf) with respect to the Funds prior to use and prior to submitting such material to any regulator.




	NFS acknowledges that the identity of Gartmore (and its affiliates and/or subsidiaries) customers and all information maintained about those customers constitute the valuable property of Gartmore. NFS agrees that, should it come
	into contact or possession of any such information (including, but not limited to, lists or compilations of the identity of such customers), NFS shall hold such information or property in confidence and shall not use, disclose or distribute any such
	information or property except with Gartmore prior written consent or as required by law or judicial process. This paragraph shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.




	 




	1







	NFS acknowledges that the services provided for under this Agreement by Gartmore are not exclusive and
	that the same skill will be used in performing services to other companies in similar contexts. NFS represents that it will use its best efforts to give equal emphasis and promotion to shares of the Funds as is given to other investment options that
	may be available in NFS contracts.




	NFS represents that the Contracts marketed as annuity contracts and/or life insurance policies are
	currently treated as annuity contracts and/or life insurance policies under the appropriate provisions of the Code, and that it shall make every effort to maintain such treatment. NFS will promptly notify Gartmore upon having a reasonable basis for
	believing that the Contracts have ceased to be treated as annuity contracts or life insurance policies, or that the Contracts may not be so treated in the future.




	For Contracts issued through the Variable Accounts, NFS represents that each Variable Account is a segregated asset account and that interests in each Variable Account are offered exclusively through the
	purchase of a variable contract, within the meaning of such terms pursuant to Section 1.817-5(f)(2) of the Federal Tax Regulations, and that it shall make every effort to continue to meet such definitional requirements. NFS shall
	promptly notify Gartmore upon having a reasonable basis for believing that such requirements have ceased to be met or that they may not be met in the future.





	REPRESENTATIONS BY GARTMORE





	Gartmore acknowledges that it receives substantial
	savings as a result of NFS performing those Services listed on Exhibit B on behalf of the Funds.




	Gartmore and its agents shall make no
	representations about NFS except those contained in publicly available documents or other documents produced by NFS (or an entity on its behalf). Gartmore agrees to allow a reasonable period of time for NFS to review any advertising and sales
	literature drafted by Gartmore (or agents on its behalf) with respect to NFS prior to use and prior to submitting such material to any regulator.




	Gartmore acknowledges that the identity of NFS (and its affiliates and/or subsidiaries) customers and that all information maintained about those customers constitute the valuable property of NFS. Gartmore agrees that, should it
	come into contact or possession of any such information (including, but not limited to, lists or compilations of the identity of such customers), Gartmore shall hold such information or property in confidence and shall not use, disclose or
	distribute any such information or property except with NFS prior written consent or as required by law or judicial process. This paragraph shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.




	Gartmore acknowledges that the services provided for under this Agreement by NFS or an NFS Affiliate/Subsidiary are not exclusive and that the same skill
	will be used in performing services to other companies in similar contexts. Gartmore represents that it will use its best efforts to give equal emphasis and promotion to NFS as is given to companies in similar contexts.




	Gartmore represents that the Funds are currently qualified as regulated investment companies under Subchapter M of the Code, and that the Funds shall
	make every effort to maintain such qualification. Gartmore shall promptly notify NFS upon having a reasonable basis for believing that the Funds have ceased to so qualify, or that they may not qualify as such in the future.




	Gartmore represents that any insurance Funds utilized in the Contracts currently comply with the diversification requirements pursuant to
	Section 817(h) of the Code and Section 1.817-5(b) of the Federal Tax Regulations, if required, and that such Funds will make every effort to maintain the Funds compliance with such diversification requirements, unless the Funds are
	otherwise exempt from Section 817(h) and/or except as otherwise disclosed in each Funds prospectus. Gartmore will notify NFS promptly upon having a reasonable basis for believing that the Funds have ceased to so qualify, or that the Funds
	might not so qualify in the future.




	 




	2









	CUSTOMER PRIVACY






	Gartmore acknowledges that it has read, and to the extent applicable agrees to comply with the Nationwides privacy policy that is explained in Nationwides Privacy Statement, herein
	attached as Exhibit F, which may be updated from time to time.




	Gartmore agrees to comply with all laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances
	relating to privacy, confidentiality, security, data security, and the handling of customer information which may from time to time be established.




	Gartmore agrees not to disclose or use any consumer nonpublic personal information (including nonpublic personal financial information and nonpublic personal health information), which may be supplied by Nationwide to Gartmore in
	performance under this Agreement other than to:



	 





	 





	a)






	carry out the purpose for which the information was provided; and






	 





	 





	b)






	to use or disclose the information as otherwise permitted or required by law.







	NFS agrees to comply with all laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances relating to privacy, confidentiality, security, data security, and the handling of customer information which may from time
	to time be established.




	NFS agrees not to disclose or use any consumer nonpublic personal information (including nonpublic personal
	financial information and nonpublic personal health information), which may be supplied by Gartmore to NFS in performance under this Agreement other than to:



	 





	 





	a)






	carry out the purpose for which the information was provided; and






	 





	 





	b)






	to use or disclose the information as otherwise permitted or required by law.







	This provision will survive and continue in full force and effect after the termination of this Agreement.






	TRADING






	Subject to the
	terms and conditions of this Agreement, NFS shall be appointed to, and agrees to act, as a limited agent of Gartmore for the sole purpose of receiving instructions from authorized parties as defined by the Contracts for the purchase and redemption
	of Fund shares prior to the close of regular trading each Business Day. A Business Day shall mean any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which the Fund calculates its net asset value as set forth in the
	Funds most recent prospectus and Statement of Additional Information. Except as particularly stated in this paragraph, NFS shall have no authority to act on behalf of Gartmore or to incur any cost or liability on its behalf.




	Until such time as Gartmore and NFS are able to utilize the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Defined Contribution Clearing and
	Settlement (DCC&S) Fund/SERV system;




	Gartmore will use its best efforts to provide to NFS or its designated agent closing
	net asset value, change in net asset value, dividend or daily accrual rate information and capital gain information by 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time each Business Day. NFS or its agent shall use this data to calculate unit values. Unit values shall be used
	to process the same Business Days contract transactions. Orders derived from, and in amounts equal to, instructions received by NFS prior to the Close of Trading on the New York Stock Exchange on any Business Day (Day 1) shall be
	transmitted without modification (except for netting or aggregating such orders) to Gartmore by 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on the next Business Day. Such trades will be effected at the net assets value of each Funds shares calculated as of the
	Close of Trading on Day 1. Gartmore will not accept any order made on a conditional basis or subject to any delay or contingency. NFS shall only place purchase orders for shares of Funds on behalf of its customers whose addresses recorded on
	NFS books are in a state or other jurisdiction in which the Funds are registered or qualified for sale, or are exempt from registration or qualification as confirmed in writing by Gartmore.




	Until such time as Gartmore and NFS are able to utilize the DCC&S Fund/SERV system, each party shall, as soon as practicable after its receipt of an
	instruction or confirmation transmitted, verify its receipt of such instruction or confirmation, and in the absence of such verification such a party to whom an instruction or confirmation is sent shall not be liable for any failure to act in
	accordance with such instruction or confirmation, and the sending party




	 




	3







	may not claim that such an instruction or confirmation was received by the other. Each party shall notify
	the other of any errors, omissions or interruptions in, or delay or unavailability as promptly as possible.



	 





	 





	a)






	For those purchase orders not transmitted via the DCC&S Fund/SERV system, NFS shall initiate payment to Gartmore or its designated agent in federal funds no
	later than 1:00 P.M. on the Business Day following the day on which the instructions are treated as having been received by Gartmore pursuant to this Agreement.






	 





	 





	b)






	For those redemption orders not transmitted via the DCC&S Fund/SERV system, Gartmore or its designated agent shall initiate payment in federal funds no later
	than 1:00 P.M. on the Business Day following the day on which the instructions are treated as having been received by Gartmore pursuant to this Agreement.







	At such time as Gartmore and NFS are able to transmit information via the NSCCs DCC&S Fund/SERV System:



	 





	 





	a)






	Orders derived from, and in amounts equal to, instructions received by NFS prior to the Close of Trading on Day 1 shall be transmitted without modification
	(except for netting and aggregation of such orders) via the NSCCs DCC&S Fund/SERV system to Gartmore no later than 5:00 A.M. Eastern Time on the Next Business Day. Such trades will be effected at the net asset value of each Funds
	shares calculated as of the Close of Trading on Day 1.






	 





	 





	b)






	Gartmore and NFS shall mutually agree there may be instances when orders shall be transmitted to Gartmore via facsimile no later than 9:00 A.M. rather than
	through the DCC&S Fund/SERV system. In such instances, such orders shall be transmitted to Gartmore via facsimile no later than 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on the next Business Day.






	 





	 





	c)






	With respect to purchase and redemption orders received by Gartmore on any Business Day for any Fund, within the time limits set forth in this Agreement,
	settlement shall occur consistent with the requirements of DCC&S Fund/SERV system.







	At such time as Gartmore and NFS
	are able to transmit information via the DCC&S Fund/SERV system; Gartmore or its designated agent shall send to NFS, via the DCC&S Fund/SERV system, verification of net purchase or redemption orders or notification of the rejection of such
	orders (Confirmations ) on each Business Day for which NFS has transmitted such orders. Such confirmations shall include the total number of shares of each Fund held by NFS following such net purchase or redemption. Gartmore, or its
	designated agent, shall submit in a timely manner, such confirmations to the DCC&S Fund/SERV system in order for NFS to receive such confirmations no later than 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time the next Business Day. Gartmore or its designated agent will
	transmit to NFS via DCC&S NETWORKING system those Networking activity files reflecting account activity. In addition, within five (5) business days after the end of each month, Gartmore or its affiliate will send NFS a statement of account
	which shall confirm all transactions made during that particular month in the account.






	NATIONWIDE ADVISORY SERVICES WRAP PROGRAM






	NFS has retained PFPC INC. (PFPC) to perform administrative and shareholder services in support of the Wrap Program,
	including the transmission of all purchase, redemption, and exchange orders with respect to Fund transactions in the Mutual Fund Wrap (Orders). NFS hereby authorizes Distributor to accept Orders placed by PFPC on NFSs behalf. NFS
	shall notify Distributor in writing 10 days prior to the effective date of any revocation of this authorization.






	DOCUMENTS AND OTHER
	MATERIALS







	DOCUMENTS PROVIDED BY NFS





	NFS agrees to provide Gartmore, upon written request, any reports indicating the number of shareholders that hold interests in the Funds and such other information (including books and records)
	that Gartmore may reasonably request or as may be necessary or advisable to enable it to comply with any law, regulation or order.




	 




	4








	DOCUMENTS PROVIDED BY GARTMORE





	Within 10 Business Days after the end of each calendar month, Gartmore shall provide NFS, or its designee, a monthly statement of account, which shall
	confirm all transactions made during that particular month.




	Gartmore shall promptly provide NFS, or cause NFS to be provided with, a
	reasonable quantity of the Funds prospectuses, Statements of Additional Information and any supplements thereto.

	Any party may change its address by notifying the
	other party(ies) in writing.






	VOTING






	For Variable Accounts that are registered under the 1940 Act and so long as and to the extent that the SEC continues to interpret the 1940 Act to require pass-through voting privileges for variable contract owners,
	NFS shall distribute all proxy material furnished by Gartmore (provided that such material is received by NFS or its designated agent at least 10 Business Days prior to the date scheduled for mailing to contract owners) and shall vote Fund shares in
	accordance with instructions received from the contract owners who have interests in such Fund shares. NFS shall vote the Fund shares for which no instructions have been received in the same proportion as Fund shares for which said instructions have
	been received from the contract owners, provided that such proportional voting is not prohibited by a contract owners plan or trust document, if applicable. NFS and its agents will in no way recommend an action in connection with or oppose or
	interfere with the solicitation of proxies in the Fund shares.






	EXPENSES






	All expenses incident to the performance by NFS under this Agreement shall be paid by NFS. Likewise, all expenses incident to the performance by Gartmore
	under this Agreement shall be paid by Gartmore.




	NFS shall not bear any of the expenses for the cost of registration of the Funds
	shares, preparation of the Funds prospectuses, proxy materials, and reports and the preparation of other related statements and notices required by law except as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties to the Agreement.




	For NFS annual mailing to customers of product and fund prospectuses, Gartmore will pay the lesser of:



	 





	 





	a.






	The cost to print individual fund prospectuses; or






	 





	 





	b.






	Gartmores portion of printing costs if NFS does not use individual prospectuses, but reprints fund prospectuses in another format.







	Should a Fund no longer be available in an NFS contract, Gartmore shall be responsible for any and all expenses incurred
	as a result of removing such Fund as an available investment option under the Contract.




	 




	5







	Should NFS desire to no longer have a Fund available in an NFS contract, NFS shall be responsible for any
	and all expenses incurred as a result of removing such Fund as an available investment option under the Contract.




	Should a removal of a
	fund as an available investment option be mutually desired by the parties, the parties agree to equally share any expenses incurred as a result of removing such Fund as an available investment option.




	Both NFS and Gartmore agree to provide reasonable advance notice of the election to remove a fund as an available investment option in order to permit
	the parties to file documentation as may be required under applicable law.






	CONFLICTS






	Each party agrees to inform the other of the existence of, or any potential for, any material conflicts of interest between the parties and any possible
	implications of the same.




	It is agreed that if it is determined by a majority of the members of the Boards of Directors of the Funds, or a
	majority of the Funds disinterested Directors, that a material conflict exists caused by NFS, NFS shall at its own expense, take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate such material conflict.




	It is agreed that if it is determined by NFS that a material conflict exists caused by Gartmore, Gartmore shall at its own expense, take whatever steps
	are necessary to remedy or eliminate such material conflict.






	INDEMNIFICATION






	Each party shall promptly notify the other party(ies) in writing of any situation which presents or appears to involve a claim which may be the subject of
	indemnification under this Agreement and the indemnifying party shall have the option to defend against any such claim. In the event the indemnifying party so elects, it shall notify the indemnified party and shall assume the defense of such claim,
	and the indemnified party shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party, at the indemnifying partys expense, in defense of such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
	such claim at its own expense through counsel of its own choosing. Neither party shall admit to wrong-doing nor make any compromise in any action or proceeding which may result in a finding of wrongdoing by the other party without the other
	partys prior written consent. Any notice given by the indemnifying party to an indemnified party or participation in or control of the litigation of any such claim by the indemnifying party shall in no event be deemed an admission by the
	indemnifying party of culpability, and the indemnifying party shall be free to contest liability among the parties with respect to the claim.





	INDEMNIFICATION BY NFS





	NFS agrees to reimburse and/or indemnify and hold
	harmless Gartmore and each of its directors, officers, employees, agents and each person, if any, who controls Gartmore within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) (collectively, Affiliated Party) against
	any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (Losses) to which Gartmore or any such Affiliated Party may become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon,

	any such case to the extent that such statement, omission or representation or such alleged statement, alleged omission or alleged representation was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to NFS by or on behalf
	of Gartmore specifically for use therein.




	NFS shall reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by Gartmore or any

	(6)






	A failure to register the Funds under federal or state securities laws or to otherwise comply with such laws, rules, regulations or orders.







	Provided however, that Gartmore shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such statement, omission or
	representation or such alleged statement, alleged omission or alleged representation was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Gartmore by or on behalf of NFS specifically for use therein.




	Gartmore shall reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by NFS or any Affiliated Party in connection with investigating or defending any
	such Losses, provided however, that Gartmore shall have prior approval of the use of said counsel or the expenditure of said fees.




	This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which Gartmore may otherwise have.






	SERVICE FEES






	In consideration for the Services provided by NFS pursuant to this Agreement, Gartmore will calculate
	and pay, or cause one of its affiliates to pay, and NFS or an NFS Affiliate/Subsidiary that is registered as a broker/dealer, will be entitled to receive from Gartmore a fee (Service Fee). Such fee will be calculated at an annualized
	rate equal to the rates shown on Exhibit C of the average daily net assets of each Fund for which NFS performed administrative services during the period in which they were earned.




	 




	7







	The Service Fees will be paid to NFS, or its designee, by electronic funds transfer as soon as
	practicable, but no later than 30 days after the end of the period in which they were earned. If the Fund assets administered by NFS are less than $1 billion as of December 31 of the prior calendar year, the Service Fees will be paid on a
	quarterly basis. Once assets are greater than $1 billion, the Service Fees will be paid on a monthly basis. The Service Fee payment will be accompanied or preceded by a statement showing the calculation of the amounts being paid by Gartmore for the
	relevant period and such other supporting data as may be reasonably requested by NFS.




	The Service Fee shall be paid either by:



	 





	 





	(a)






	Gartmore or one of its affiliates from general operating funds;






	 





	 





	(b)






	Gartmore or one of its affiliates from funds received pursuant to a shareholder service plan (Rule 12b-1 Plan) a copy of which is attached as Exhibit
	D and incorporate herein by reference. Services are listed in Exhibit E;






	 





	 





	(c)






	Administrative Service fee paid by the Trust; or






	 





	 





	(d)






	a combination thereof.







	The
	Service Fee shall be calculated as an annualized percentage of the average aggregate amount invested in the Funds for the applicable period. The average aggregate amount shall be computed by totaling the aggregate investment on each business day
	during the period and dividing by the total number of Business Days during the period.




	The parties agree that a Service Fee will be paid
	to NFS or its designee according to this Agreement with respect to each Fund as long as shares of such Fund are held by an NFS Affiliate/Subsidiary on behalf of the beneficial owners of contracts issued by an NFS Affiliate/Subsidiary. This provision
	will survive the termination of this Agreement.




	NFS and Gartmore agree that the Service Fees described in this Agreement are for
	administrative and distribution services of the Funds only, and do not constitute payment in any manner for investment advisory services for the Fund or for costs of administrative and distribution services on behalf of the Contracts.




	Fees paid pursuant to a Rule 12b-1 Plan may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by the vote of a majority of the members of
	the Board of Trustees of the Trust who are not interested persons of the Trust and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Rule 12b-1 Plan or in any related agreements to the Rule 12b-1 Plan (Disinterested
	Trustees) or by a majority of the outstanding Shares, each with respect to a class of a 12b-1 Fund, upon delivery of written notice thereof to the parties to this Agreement.




	This Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment as defined in the 1940 Act or upon termination of the Distributor underwriting agreement with the Fund






	COMPLIANCE WITH AGREEMENT






	The
	forbearance or neglect of any party to insist upon strict compliance by another party with any of the provisions of this Agreement, whether continuing or not, or to declare a forfeiture of termination against the other parties, shall not be
	construed as a waiver of any rights or privileges of any party hereunder. No waiver of any right or privilege of any party arising from any default or failure of performance by any party shall affect the rights or privileges of the other parties in
	the event of a further default or failure of performance.






	TERMINATION






	This Agreement shall terminate as to the availability of shares of the Funds for new Contracts:



	 






	(1)






	at the option of NFS or Gartmore upon at least 90 days advance written notice to the other;






	 






	(2)






	at any time upon Gartmore s election, if the Funds determine that liquidation of the Funds is in the best interest of the Funds or their beneficial owners.
	Reasonable advance notice of election to liquidate shall be provided to NFS in order to permit the substitution of Fund shares, if necessary, with shares of another investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and other applicable securities
	regulations;






	 






	(3)






	if the applicable annuity contracts and life insurance policies are not treated as annuity contracts or life insurance policies by the applicable regulators or
	under applicable rules and regulations;







	 




	8










	(4)






	if the Variable Accounts are not deemed segregated asset accounts by the applicable regulators or under applicable rules and regulations;






	 






	(5)






	at the option of NFS, if Fund shares are not available for any reason to meet the requirements of Contracts as determined by NFS. Reasonable advance notice of
	election to terminate (and time to cure) shall be furnished by NFS;






	 






	(6)






	at the option of NFS or Gartmore, upon institution of relevant formal proceedings against the broker-dealer(s) marketing the Contracts, the Variable Accounts,
	NFS, an NFS Affiliate/Subsidiary or the Funds by the NASD, the IRS, the Department of Labor, the SEC, state insurance departments or any other regulatory body;






	 






	(7)






	upon a decision by NFS, in accordance with the 1940 Act and applicable regulations, to substitute such Fund shares with the shares of another investment company
	for Contracts for which the Fund shares have been selected to serve as the underlying investment medium. NFS shall give at least 60 days written notice to Gartmore of any proposal to substitute Fund shares;






	 






	(8)






	upon assignment of this Agreement unless such assignment is made with the written consent of each party; and






	 






	(9)






	in the even Fund shares are not registered, issued or sold pursuant to federal law and state securities laws, or such laws preclude the use of Fund shares as an
	underlying investment medium of Contracts issued or to be issued by an NFS Affiliate/Subsidiary. Prompt written notice shall be given by either party to the other in the event the conditions of this provision occur.









	JURISDICTION






	This Agreement
	shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted under and in accordance with the laws of Ohio, without respect to its choice of law provisions and in accordance with the 1940 Act. In the case of any conflict, the 1940 Act shall control.






	PARTNERSHIPS/JOINT VENTURES






	Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a partnership or join venture by and among the parties hereto.






	AMENDMENTS TO THIS AGREEMENT
