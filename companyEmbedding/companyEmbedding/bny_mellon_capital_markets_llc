BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC Weekly Market Commentary 

Marvin Loh – Managing Director, BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC
Perhaps money can grow on trees, if you are a central bank. The Bank of Japan pledged this week to do what it takes to corral its inflation rate into the 2% range. In a very Fed-esque manner, the new Japanese leadership will double its purchase of government bonds and grow its equity market holdings. Overall purchases will exceed 80 trillion ¥, almost three times larger than the Fed’s current QE (infinity) program on a relative (to gross domestic product [GDP]) basis. This continues to signal an all-in attitude from all large central banks, which will keep easy money flowing into the foreseeable future. Government bond yields have subsequently collapsed around the globe, with a set of weak economic numbers providing an additional impetus for Treasury yields. Today’s employment report was simply the cherry on the sundae, missing expectations by more than 50%. The 88,000 jobs created were the lowest since last summer, and the decline in the unemployment rate was accompanied with a more than three-decade low in workforce participation. Treasury yields generally stand at year-to-date lows, with a large bull flattener taking precedence over the past two days. Interestingly, spread product had a generally benign week, with Investment Grade and High Yield generally unchanged, and we suspect that volatility remained at suppressed levels due to central bank policies. Next week marks the start of earning season, which will either affirm or contradict the strong equity performance since the start of the year. Individual equity sector performance indicates investor reluctance in hitting record levels, which will need support to continue. There are limited economic releases next week, and minutes to last month’s FOMC will also be released. Read the full commentary now.

NEW YORK, AUSTIN TX, BOSTON MA, MCLEAN VA









OVERVIEW
We are focused on delivering a comprehensive suite of real estate investment offerings to institutional and individual investors globally.
Our real estate expertise is grounded in distinctive intellectual capital and proprietary technology designed to help clients meet their portfolio needs.
Our investment philosophy is  predicated on the belief that blending rich asset-level detail, quantitative capabilities and strong fundamental insight leads to optimal investment results.
We provide investors access to both differentiated data and analysis capabilities and BNY Mellon’s global footprint.
We are well-positioned to react nimbly and with scale to the evolving opportunities in the real estate capital markets.



Investment Strategies
U.S. single family equity: Amherst Capital’s U.S. single family equity strategy invests at least 85% in stabilized pools of single family rental homes to provide investors dividend income and potential home price appreciation (HPA) upside. Strategy is designed to address the market demand for open-ended, core-focused, real estate equity funds.
Commercial real estate lending: Originate-to-hold first lien mortgages on transitional commercial real estate. We believe our vertically integrated platform- from direct origination to post-close asset management- leads to enhanced investment results. Our CRE team was onboarded to operate in a continuous manner with existing direct relationships and processes.
Mortgage backed securities: Strategies that cover team leverages Amherst Capital’s exclusive1 access to Amherst InsightLabs’ proprietary suite of technology in managing $5.1 billion within both mortgage-specific strategies and multi-sector accounts. Proprietary analytics provide deep data capture down to borrower level and sophisticated modeling which we believe allows us to better determine value

With a diverse offering of strategies, BNY Mellon is able to meet a wide range of investment objectives for investors. In this paper, we outline the base-case scenario for Economic Policy Pivots of the Trump administration, then a link to those policy pivots to Market Themes, and finally a discussion of certain Market Risks.
Economic Outlook

President Trump’s policy agenda—with its far-reaching implications for growth, regulation, trade and geopolitics—is likely to be the overarching focus for markets in 2017. What makes this so intriguing from an investment strategy perspective is that embedded in this agenda are themes that speak to elevated risks at both ends of the risk spectrum. The right tail† is dominated by increasing economic growth optimism fueled by a combination of fiscal policy and deregulation. The left tail is dominated by unprecedented levels of political and policy uncertainty that threatens to drive up the risk premium of risk assets.
So far, the right tail has largely dominated as equity markets made new highs since the inauguration. Nonetheless, the executive orders that have accompanied Trump’s first months in office have also served to remind investors of the market risks associated with the President’s pursuit of the anti-globalization elements of his overall policy agenda.
 




Policy Pivot One: Shift From Monetary to Fiscal Policy
The Trump agenda presents investors with three broad economic policy pivots.  The first change is that the engine of the growth stimulus has shifted from monetary policy to fiscal policy, as a pro-growth fiscal agenda sweeps over the economy.  This emphasis on lower corporate and individual tax rates, repatriation of over $2 trillion in overseas U.S. corporate profits, and infrastructure spending has already produced significant moves in consumer and business sentiment even as the hard numbers on the economy have come to light .





Policy Pivot Two: The Promise of De-Regulation
Second, the promise of de-regulation is a significant pivot from the previous administration as Congress and the President have quickly settled into repealing a significant chunk of the Obama regulatory regime across a variety of industries, including Dodd-Frank and the Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary rule. This lessening of the regulatory burden is expected to encourage credit investment and private-sector consumption growth. Sectors such as finance, energy, automobile, infrastructure, and small business in particular should be prominent beneficiaries of this deregulatory push.





Policy Pivot Three: State-Led Industrial Policy and Bilateral Trade Deals
The third notable policy pivot is the pledge to move away from multilateral international trade regimes in favor of a greater focus on state-led industrial policy and bilateral trade deals. This shift embeds within it some of the greatest risks for the economy. What new trade regimes ultimately develop from this reversal may be less important than the heightened uncertainty and the inability to predict process or outcomes which are critical foundations of a stable economic and capital market environment.





Taken together, the economic environment of 2017 has the potential to be an inflection from the “low and slow” backdrop of previous years. The baseline expectation for 2017 is that fiscal stimulus and de-regulation will encourage investment growth and consumption with the potential to add 1%-1.5% to GDP cumulatively over the next two years. The reflationary policies of the Trump administration, coming on top of recent moves in inflation rates, are likely to send inflation expectations higher still. Global growth prospects have also improved, propelled by stronger manufacturing activity in China and a notable uptick in activity in Europe. Indeed, global economies appear to be in the midst of a synchronized cyclical upswing. However, unprecedented uncertainty associated with domestic and foreign policy choices, implementation, and outcomes is likely to be a source of volatility for all asset classes in the near future, even as risk asset markets have moved higher.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined based of goods and averaging them. Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) is equal to CPI minus energy and food prices and is used to measure core inflation. The reason behind excluding energy and food prices is because the prices of these goods can be very volatile.
The Standard & Poor’s 500, often abbreviated as the S&P 500, or just “the S&P”, is an American stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ.

The Russell 2000 index is an index measuring the performance approximately 2,000 small-cap companies in the Russell 3000 Index, which is made up of 3,000 of the biggest U.S. stocks. The Russell 2000 serves as a benchmark for small-cap stocks in the United States.
