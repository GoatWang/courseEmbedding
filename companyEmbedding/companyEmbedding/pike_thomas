Through careful examination of primary documents, this book reveals that the true purpose of Zebulon Pike's western expedition in 1806–1807 was not innocent exploration of the West but an espionage mission in preparation for an American invasion of New Mexico.
In 1806, the United States was on the brink of war with Spain over the disputed western boundary of the Louisiana Purchase and anticipated invading New Mexico. Possessing only meager information on the terrain as well as Spanish troop numbers and fortifications, President Thomas Jefferson and General James Wilkinson needed an agent who could cross the continent to Spanish territory all the way to the capital of Santa Fe, provide a plausible "cover story" for being there, and return with the vital information. Zebulon Pike: Thomas Jefferson's Agent for Empire is the story of how Pike carried out his mission as a prelude to an American invasion of New Mexico.This unique book is the first to fully chronicle Pike's 1806–1807 expedition to the Rocky Mountains and beyond, addressing both the exploratory and the clandestine purposes of Pike's western journey. By carefully examining the evidence available in primary documents, which shows that Pike prepared and carried a map showing a route to Santa Fe on his journey, the author overturns the conventional wisdom that Pike became lost searching for the Red River and mistakenly wandered into Spanish territory. This book also presents the Spanish perspective and response to Pike's invasion of Spanish territory and provides historical context to understand the role of Pike's expedition in Thomas Jefferson's quest to build an American "empire for liberty."
Features
Clarifies the true purpose of Zebulon Pike's 1806–1807 western journey and answers the question asked for more than 200 years: Was Pike an explorer or a spy?Examines historical evidence that Pike's actual purpose was to conduct a military reconnaissance in preparation for an American invasion of New MexicoExplains how Pike rightfully earned the title, "Father of the Santa Fe Trail," with the 1810 publication of his book, An Account of Expeditions






Author Info

George R. Matthews is a historian who has received the Charles Redd Center for Western Studies Research Grant and twice been awarded the Historical Society of New Mexico and Office of the State Historian Research Fellowship. He is the author of America's First Olympics: The St. Louis Games of 1904 and When the Cubs Won It All: The 1908 Championship Season. A resident of southern New Mexico, Matthews has hiked or bicycled much of Zebulon Pike's route as part of his on-the-ground research for his latest book.

Reviews/Endorsements
Endorsements"Matthews’ Zebulon Pike reconstructs Pike’s southwestern excursion to Santa Fe, revealing how Pike aided James Wilkinson’s nefarious schemes and expanded Jefferson’s 'Empire of Liberty.'  The map to Santa Fe that Pike carried reveals that he may not have been quite so lost after all!"—Jay H. Buckley, Coauthor of Zebulon Pike, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West"Matthews challenges the standard narrative that Zebulon Pike was lost when Spaniards captured him in present-day Colorado in February 1807. This groundbreaking study argues convincingly that Pike had a map. This proves he knew where he was and reveals what he was up to—spying for President Thomas Jefferson."—Rick Hendricks, PhD, New Mexico State Historian"George Matthews skillfully captures the era of international intrigue that surrounded America's western expansion. He unpacks the political dimensions of Jefferson's dream of an 'empire for liberty' and Pike's deep exploration of the vast interior of North America. With wit and eloquence Matthews connects the diplomacy and duplicity of American, Spanish, and French operatives in the emergence of the nation."—Frances Levine, PhD, President, Missouri Historical Society"Matthews clearly explains complex intrigues and easily balances the many moving pieces of the Pike story."—Meg Frisbee, Metropolitan State University of Denver"Here is a story of espionage, depravity, and empire with New Mexico in the cross hairs. This is a much-needed fresh look at an important aspect of American history."—Thomas E. Chávez, PhD, Author of Spain and the Independence of the United States: An Intrinsic Gift and Chasing History: Quixotic Quests for Artifacts, Art, and Heritage

	Lures and baits are imitations and preserved forms of baitfish and invertebrates designed to attract predatory fish to a specific location to be caught by the hooks attached to the lures. This is the largest, most varied category of all fishing tackle. The word lure typically refers to the imitations made for casting and trolling. Baits refer to the preserved baitfish and fish parts, along with artificial baits, which may contain natural and synthetic substances to closely imitate smaller creatures and their scents. Some lures and baits can be combined to increase their effectiveness, and many anglers will modify them to create unique actions and profiles to fool heavily pressured fish.
	Most lures are designed for specific tactics, water conditions, depths, speeds and predatory fish species. Lures range in weight from 1/124 oz. to several ounces, and are designed to float, suspend, sink or dive at controlled depths and increments as needed. Lures can be finished in multitudes of surface designs and colors including neons, metallics, glow, ultra-violet, and transparent finishes. The type of finish is dependent on the species they are imitating and the effect intended. They can also have different mechanical designs such as jointed sections, internal rattles, and trailer hooks. The different subcategories of lures and baits available at FishUSA include hard baits, soft baits, jigs and jig heads, spoons, spinners, spinnerbaits and buzzbaits, artificial baits, prepared and cured baits, attractants and cures, worm harnesses, trolling rigs and flies, lure components and flies.
	Most hard baits were originally carved from wood, which has been mostly replaced by plastics in modern lure-making, while metals are used for others. Specific types of hard baits are stickbaits, crankbaits, jerkbaits, swimbaits, jigging lures and blade baits and topwater lures. Soft baits are rubber, silicone or other soft plastics molded into swimbaits, grubs, worms, tubes and other baitfish patterns. Jigs and jig heads are lead, tungsten, or tin weights molded onto specially designed hooks with long shanks to accept soft baits or materials to imitate various creatures. Spoons are metallic “blades” with shapes and bends similar to the eating utensil, and most often imitate swimming or injured baitfish for casting, jigging and trolling. Spinners feature metal blades which spin freely on a weighted or unweighted stiff-wire shaft and create wide-reaching vibrations to trigger fish to chase and strike. Spinnerbaits are combinations of jigs and spinners creating larger profiles and tremendous vibration and motion. 
	Artificial baits are products designed to specifically imitate the look and scent of live bait without the expense and difficulty of storing live bait. These include hard and soft plastic eggs and roe, paste and dough, nuggets made of similar compounds to dough but hold their shape better, larvae and waxies, and baitfish. Prepared and cured baits are natural eggs and roe, baitfish and cutbait, and worms. All of these have been preserved to prevent rot and decay. Attractants and cures are liquids and pastes to coat and spray scent onto lures, preserve and cure your own eggs and baitfish, and to attract fish to specific areas in the water. 
	Worm harnesses are similar to spinners but are pre-made bait rigs with blades, weights, and typically two hooks to hold nightcrawler worms for moderately-sized predatory fish. Some trolling rigs and flies function as large versions of worm harnesses to hold cutbait, while others are designed to have trolling flies or other small profile lures attached for large freshwater and saltwater species. Lure components are offered for the anglers wishing to build their own custom trolling rigs or to modify commercial harnesses.
	Flies make up the final category of Lures and Bait and are specifically designed for fly fishing anglers targeting both saltwater and freshwater species. Dry flies are very light flies designed to float on the water’s surface, imitating flying insects in their adult stage. Nymphs, emergers and wet flies are tied to imitate the early and middle stages of an insect’s life below the surface. Streamers and muddlers are typically larger flies imitating baitfish, crayfish, leeches and other swimming creatures. Worms, sowbugs and scuds are imitations of bugs and worms which often fall from trees overhanging the streambanks. Poppers imitate frogs, mice and large bugs moving and splashing on the surface. Terrestrials imitate grasshoppers, crickets and ants that feed hungry fish when they miss the next blade of grass and end up in the water. Crayfish are wide-profile wet flies imitating the crab-like crayfish that are food for fish in streams, rivers and ponds. Egg patterns imitate single eggs and egg clusters primarily used for trout and salmon.
	The top five lure and bait brands at FishUSA are Rapala, Yo-Zuri, Berkley, Reef Runner and Smithwick.

Spoon.  The lure has a wobbling motion different from the typical spoon that allows you to keep it up near the surface, despite its compact size and weight.  This allows you to work it close to the shoreline when prey fish are going after minnows without getting hung up as other spoons of the same weight would.  As the other reviewer noted, it also has a nice flutter motion on the retrieve and stop sequence which also attracts fish.   The 1/4 oz version is small at 1.5," so it casts well, but it also means it is unlikely attract big fish when they are going after larger prey.  Nonetheless, it is a good tool to have in the tackle box, especially when the predators are being finicky or along the shore.JPR-ErieErie, PA (0) / (0) :Must buy spoon for trout 
            
            
             (from prior model) ✔  I'd recommend this!May 01, 2015Pros: Small but heavyBest Uses: TroutComments: I bought the 1/6 oz copper/gold spoon and used it for trout fishing in lakes. This lure is very small but heavy so it casts very far for a small sized lure and sinks very well too. It is unlike any spoon I have purchased before. Well worth the money. When I want to cover a lot of water, I would retrieve quite fast and stop and fast and stop kind of pattern near the surface. Surface active trout will hammer when the spoon flutters down at the stop phase. Can also fish deep and slow with go stop motion. Because the spoon is small, it is also effective in very clear water lakes when fish are pressured. Nice spoon to have it in your tool box.BigblueBritish Columbia (3) / (0) :Sign in to complete a review of this product.

	A spoon is a metal, concave lure available in several color and size combinations. There are also different designs and sizes for casting, trolling, or jigging the spoon. The idea behind the spoon lure is having it move around in the water, wiggling back and forth like an injured baitfish. The material the spoon is made from will also reflect light, catching the attention of your target fish. 
	The most popular brands of spoons at FIshUSA include Acme Tackle, Bay de Noc Lure, Thomas Lures, Dreamweaver and Custom Jigs & Spins.
