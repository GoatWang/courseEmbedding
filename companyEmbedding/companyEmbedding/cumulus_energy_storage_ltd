Cumulus Energy Storage (CES) aims to be the leading manufacturer and developer of grid-level energy storage batteries with the lowest levelised cost of energy (LCOE) globally.
Large scale storage is an essential part of the future of energy. We need electricity super-storage to give industry the freedom of instantly available renewable electricity; give the grid capacity to deliver security of supply; and give time-shifting to renewables so that solar energy after sunset becomes reality.
The market drivers for energy storage are set in legislation. Increasing distributed renewables generation, especially the recent growth in solar PV on top of onshore and offshore wind, is causing pain points for grid infrastructure and incumbent generators; creating urgent global need for reliable low-cost, scalable grid-level energy storage.
CES has taken the bold and visionary step of combining a 200 year old technology from one industry, with technology from two other industrial-scale processes, to create a disruptive opportunity – electricity super-storage – using patent granted technology in the form of a low-cost grid-scale rechargeable Copper/Zinc battery.
With financial support from the UK government and equity investment, CES has extended from Sheffield to San Francisco, with laboratory facilities developing grid-connected full-scale prototypes. Further A round investment will enable pilot line production capacity of 1MWh/year by end of 2016 in Sheffield, UK, and B round investment is designed to facilitate a 500MWh-1GWh/year production capability.

Enabling renewable electricity

Markets
Commercial Renewables
Curtailment payments to wind farm operators in the UK are likely to exceed £80m in 2015 (up from £53m in 2014). In China 15.2% of wind-generated electricity was curtailed in the first half of 2015 (compared to 6.8% for the first half of 2014). This picture is repeated across the world due to grid capacity constraints and provides an opportunity for storage to time-shift the generation.
The Global Wind Energy Council forecasts the cumulative GW of wind generation to increase by 80% from 370GW at the end of 2014 to 666GW by the end of 2019.
Commercial solar in the UK is also facing curtailment and postponed approvals due to grid network constraints. The UK has 8.3GW solar PV installed capacity (source: DECC, October 2015) so is now the 6th largest solar PV generator in the world, behind China (45GW), Germany (40GW), Japan (33GW), US (26GW) and Italy (19GW). The cumulative solar PV installations globally are forecast by Solar Power Europe to more than double from 178GW at end 2014 to 468GW by end 2019.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure we see as a clear market for the future rather than now, due to the need for a clear energy storage policy, business models that recognise the value energy storage brings to the grid, a clear and distinct definition of energy storage, standards and protocols to enable grid-connection. To facilitate and influence this we are members of Gridstor, the Renewable Energy Association, Electricity Storage Network and the California Energy Storage Association.
Energy Intensive Industries
“UK factories shut down to avoid high power costs” is the Financial Times headline on 18/2/14. Sheffield Forgemasters, Tata Steel, Celsa Manufacturing and SSI (Sahaviriya Steel Industries) are all mentioned in the FT article as some of 100,000 UK companies in energy intensive industries that take the risk of high electricity prices if they produce during one or more of the 3 annual ‘triad’ periods, in return for lower prices for the rest of the year. Triads are the 3 half-hours with the maximum national electricity demand each year that typically happen Nov-Feb between 16.00 and 19.00, but they are not announced in advance. To avoid being penalised, in some cases by several £m, these and other firms frequently shut down or adjust their production programme.
The above article focuses on the UK, however there is a global opportunity to improve energy management and drive down energy costs for energy intensive industries across the world.
Customer Interest Group
CES has formed a powerful customer interest group to ensure what we design and manufacture is what customers want to purchase. Members include E.ON, National Grid, UKPN, Sheffield Forgemasters, Evalu8, Solar South West, Siemens, Costain, S&C Electric Europe, University of Sheffield, Knowledge Transfer Network. The people within each of these organisations are responsible for energy storage.

Using chemistries and architectures already used for 50 years in the mining industry at ~100 MWh scale equivalent, we have developed a rechargeable Copper/Zinc battery that is safe, reliable and sustainable, and offers class-leading Total Cost of Ownership to our customers.
Our unique technology will play a significant role in improving the economics of renewable generation and transforming energy markets.
Our vision is: To be the leading manufacturer and developer of grid-level energy storage batteries with the lowest levelised cost of energy (LCOE) globally.
Our core purpose is: ‘enabling renewable electricity’
Our values are: Innovation, Trust, Professionalism, Enjoyment and Employee Development

The Dawn of Super Storage
Posted on 23 Jun 2015
          by Website Administrator

Tesla’s ground-breaking announcement of its utility-scale Powerpack battery systems heralds the dawn of electricity super-storage. 
This means big shipping container and factory sized batteries that give us clean and cheap energy exactly where and when we need it.
Why do we need to store our electricity like this? 
The government has begun its long term commitment to turn off the UK’s coal and oil fired power stations and generate more and more electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind. As they do this, we need to find new ways to be able to access this clean electricity at any time, whatever the weather. 
Our national grid wasn’t designed to cope with the fluctuations of the wind and sun, nor the variations in electricity use that our lifestyles demand of the grid. We need electricity super-storage that will capture the surplus energy produced in optimal weather conditions and at “off-peak” times, delivering it back to us when we need it most.
At Cumulus Energy Storage we have been planning for this opportunity since 2012. 
We have designed new electricity super-storage that can be simply deployed alongside renewables sites as well as at the heart of cities, being easily integrated into industrial centres and processes and be a vital part of a grid infrastructure renewal programme. 
To achieve this we have ruthlessly focused on three things: 
Creating a scalable solution that can be used around the world - our UK team is leading a cleantech revolution in the industrial heartland of Sheffield and our San Francisco R&D team resides in the global epicentre of energy storage innovation, investment and deployment. We know what our customer needs are, from coping with brown-outs to securing off-grid generation, and we have developed a 'storage as a service' business model so there is no big upfront cost for installation. 
Developing a battery technology that delivers Megawatt capacity at the cheapest price - our grid-level batteries will store a market leading capacity of up to 100MWh with the lowest LCOE, globally. At £525 per kWh, we can provide an economical energy storage solution matched only by electricity from pumped hydro, and no other energy source can be implemented as close to where it’s actually needed.
Delivering maximum reliability - our patented innovation is based on using a proven chemical process that has existed for 200 years, in a novel way. We have taken the materials Alessandro Volta used in his Voltaic Pile and developed it further to make it rechargeable. This approach of using copper and zinc, the 25th and 26th most abundant materials on Earth, means our batteries can be rolled out rapidly and at scale. The ability to maintain our batteries whilst in operation gives them the important advantage of a 30-year lifetime, comparable to the lifetime of the rest of the assets in the electricity supply chain.
The market drivers are picking up pace. Legislation, innovation and above all, demand from commercial and industrial customers are driving the rapid adoption and implementation. The dawn of electricity super-storage is upon us and at Cumulus Energy Storage, we’re thinking big with batteries.

LONDON, Feb. 12, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cumulus Energy Storage Ltd will present at CleanEquity Monaco 2015 on March 5th & 6th at the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. 
Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150211/175029LOGO
CleanEquity Monaco is an annual invitation-only event hosted by Innovator Capital, the London based boutique investment bank.
Other partners and sponsors include Prince Albert II of Monaco's Foundation, Covington & Burling, Porter Novelli, Cranfield University, The Climate Group, PR Newswire, the Monte-Carlo SBM, Oceanographic Museum of Monaco and the Monaco Chamber of Economic Development. 
Cumulus Energy Storage has been identified by an expert panel as one of the world's most innovative cleantech companies and has been selected to present to senior financial and strategic cleantech investors, policy makers, legislators, end users and media. 
Cumulus Energy Storage is 'enabling renewable electricity' -- by developing the lowest cost grid-level energy storage battery. 
The problem we are solving is that the grid isn't designed for the increasing percentage of variable and intermittent renewables generation -- it needs a buffer and apart from pumped hydro, there isn't a low-cost solution; hence the need for our 1-100MWh Copper/Zinc battery.
To date we have received $1.2m grant funding from the UK government, plus $375k seed. We are attending CleanEquity Monaco to ask for £1m second-round seed, followed by £4m A-round finance, to enable us to develop 1MWh/month of energy storage battery manufacturing capacity in Sheffield, UK by December 2016.
We have UK patent granted, international (PCT) patent pending, plus 9 individual country patents and a nest of 4 supporting patents applied for.

Copper/Zinc - delivering renewable electricity globally
The world is generating more renewable electricity these days, when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. The problem is that the grid doesn’t always have the capacity to cope with this variable and intermittent renewable generation. What we need is low-cost large-scale energy storage to capture the surplus energy produced by renewables at off-peak times and deliver it back at times of peak demand. This is what Cumulus Energy Storage does.

We’re developing low-cost electricity super-storage batteries that make renewables work.

Using 200 year old Copper/Zinc battery technology invented by Volta, we’ve inserted a membrane between the Copper and Zinc electrodes to make the battery rechargeable and suitable for the stationary energy storage market. Applications ranging from time-shifting commercial renewables generation, to more efficient transmission and distribution networks, plus improved energy management of electricity intensive industries.

Key benefits include a levelised cost of energy (LCOE) the same or lower than that of pumped hydro (which is 96% of the global energy storage market today); delivering renewable electricity at the time it is needed by charging over 4-6 hours and discharging over the same timeframe; 99.5% recyclability; room temperature operation; 30 year asset life due to maintainability and 80% round trip efficiency (ac/ac); in short a battery designed for the high energy long duration market - the missing link for renewables.
How it benefits society
In 2016 National Grid paid UK wind farm operators £81m to not generate electricity as part of the overall need to balance electricity generation with demand. The need to curtail wind farms, because the grid couldn’t cope with the electricity generated by wind turbines, cost China in excess of $1.8bn in 2015; and the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) ‘Duck Curve’ graphically represents the difficulty caused for the electricity network by distributed solar PV generation in California. This need to balance and time-shift electricity generated by renewables is a global problem that electricity energy storage by Cumulus is ideally suited to solve.

In the UK, 2016 reports from Carbon Trust and National Infrastructure Commission forecast the following savings. 

The National Infrastructure Commission’s central finding is that smart power – principally built around three innovations, interconnection, storage, and demand flexibility – could save consumers up to £8 billion a year by 2030, help the UK meet its 2050 carbon targets, and secure the UK’s energy supply for generations.

The Carbon Trust report identified energy storage could save £2.4 billion a year system wide, also by 2030; and if regulatory hurdles are overcome this could rise to £7 billion a year.

Cumulus, together with a range of complementary energy storage, interconnector and demand side response installations, is poised to deliver these savings for the UK.

What's unique about it
Cumulus customers are commercial renewables generators (especially 1MW+ wind and solar), electricity intensive industries (e.g. Steel, Cement, Mining) and when policy is sorted out, the electricity infrastructure including transmission, distribution, rail and electric vehicle charging networks. 

Cumulus has a series of value propositions that support 100% renewable energy through Asset Deferral, Arbitrage and Ancillary Services; essentially enabling more renewable electricity to be delivered to customers at the right time without the need for expensive network investment. Payback periods are typically 5 years, which are lower than Lithium Ion battery solutions. The Levelised Cost Of Energy (LCOE) will be the same or lower than pumped hydro and a lot less than other battery technologies.

Cumulus success will be measured in MWh and then GWh of energy delivered from our Copper/Zinc batteries globally through our innovative Storage as a Service (SaaS) business model. 

Cumulus is the only company globally to be able to make and sell rechargeable Copper/Zinc batteries because of our patent granted technology.

To date Cumulus has raised £3.2m, including £800k grant from the UK government.

Opportunity to scale
Cumulus has 4 pre-orders for 100MW/400MWh with a combined value of £145m, for delivery in 2017/18/19.

Cumulus is currently raising £4m equity for a 1MWh/month pilot line and will need £25m equity for full production in Sheffield of 500MWh-1GWh/year.

The SaaS fund is likely to need £100m-£200m to service the working capital required for 5, 10 and 15 year Power Purchase Agreements. Modelling for this is under way and we have investors lining up for this fund.

Product warranties for the 5, 10 and 15 year power purchase agreements are a current constraint.

We will require contract manufacturing and licensing deals to scale up quickly enough for the global market opportunity, which is already being measured in GWh of energy storage in each of Australia, Europe, India and China.

Automation of the manufacturing facility, combined with a very simple cell architecture and low cost supply chain will be critical for scale-up, which is why we’ve designed our cells in the way we have. More storage simply means more cells, which drives cost down the experience curve.

In the UK our team of 6, including CEO, is completing the manufacturing design for the pilot line scheduled to go into a 26,000 sq.ft. facility at the Advanced Manufacturing Park, near Sheffield, in the second half of 2017.

Our production-intent prototype is on track for pilot line production later in 2017, which will enable early adopter customer feedback and further rollout.
