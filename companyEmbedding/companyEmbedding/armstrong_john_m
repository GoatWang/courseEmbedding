Employees







Armstrong, John M
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Armstrong, John M carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Armstrong, John M



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Armstrong, John M



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Best wishes Dick Irvin", 266 pages, b&w photos, ---"It�s the fourth game of the Eastern Conference playoffs, 1995. Alexei Kovalev of the Rangers is down, apparently unconscious. At the other end of the rink, the Nordiques star forward is rushing the net. Joe Sakic fans on the shot and Kovalev doesn�t move. Andy van Hellemond, the game�s most experienced referee, is somewhere in the middle, trying to decide what to do. Thinking that Sakic�s rush has failed and worried about the man who�s down, he blows his whistle. What he doesn�t know is that Sakic has somehow recaptured the puck and scored, and that Kovalev is about to get up and skate to the bench. But play has been stopped and the goal doesn�t count. The Rangers go on to win the game (in overtime) and then the series. Fortunately, not all calls are that tough. And, more often than not, the officials get them right. Most have endured a hard apprenticeship on their way to the big league. They have seen just about everything, from bench-clearing brawls to fish on the ice. They�re a savvy and tightly knit group. They have to be. They are connoisseurs of fights. Some remember when players fought with two hands, instead of grabbing the other guy with one hand while swinging the other. Some classic brawls are recalled in these pages. Gordie Howe �s decisive battle with Lou Fontinato is described by the linesman who broke it up. Later, expansion-era brawls started by Philadelphia�s "Broad Street Bullies" are similarly recalled by officials who knew, at least, what they were in for when the puck was dropped. Following the formula that has worked so well in his previous books, Dick Irvin lets the referees and linesmen tell their own story. It�s not all about mayhem. Kerry Fraser reveals the secret of his perfect hairdo. Don Koharski explains what happened after New Jersey coach Jim Schoenfeld called him "a fat pig. - And Paul Stewart tells what it�s like to make the transition from refereed to referee. The stories in Tough Calls are as varied, colourful, funny, farfetched, and revealing as any collection of anecdotes ever brought together about the game of hockey, making this an indispensable addition to every fan�s library"---, any image directly beside this listing is the actual book and not a generic photo.

Two leaves of notepaper, with two folds, ruled in red wih twenty-one lines of text in pencil, on one side of each sheet only, and signed in pencil. The two letters attached with a rusty paperclip which has marked both. Envelope attached. Sir John Simon (1973-1954), a Liberal politician, entered Parliament as a Liberal member in 1906. He became Solicitor-General in 1910 and Attorney-General in 1913. He contemplated resigning in protest at the declaration of war in 1914 but in the end he did not do so. WW I began on the 28th July 1914 and these letters reflect the deep convictions and views of the writers at that time. Simon writes ".at a time of crisis like this it is difficult to choose the right course, and it by no means follows that the right course is a course which will prevent one's choice being misunderstood. You will understand that I am writing privately and confidentially". Simon became Home Secretary in Asquith's coalition government in May 1915 but resigned early the next year in protest against the introduction of conscription.  Bookseller Inventory # 4345

Item Description: Limited to only 50 copies. Privately Printed by the Editor, 1978. 1st Edition. Signed by the Editor., 1978. Softcover. Book Condition: Very Good. First Edition. 1st Edition. Signed by the Editor with a personal dedication. Large Quarto. Original card covers, comb-binding. 118 Pages. Very Good. This piece of work by Carroll is a transcript of the 'Nomad Articles' which were printed in 'Turf, Field and Farm' between 1867 and 1875. He has taken the important information and formatted it into what he calls 'Reading Copies'. He has edited the text as there were 'typographical errors in the original which he corrected.' There's no explanation as to why Custer wrote under an alias name and didn't want to sign them off as his own but it has in the past been questioned by Custer enthusiasts but Carroll feels that 'since too few sets of the periodical exist today, and they are unindexed, this search will have to stand as complete until otherwise corrected'. The letters start with one dated 21st September 1867 in which Custer tells us about the game they hunted and in particular he goes on to explain how he attempted to shoot a buffalo and ended up shooting his own horse he was riding in the head. It is both an interesting and well written piece which almost makes you feel you are riding alongside Custer watching it all happen. Carroll writes in his introduction that he hasn't edited the letters, that they are Custer's own words and this I think is a great piece of history to read. From the General's own eyes and what he saw and thought. The letters go on to explain marches that were done against the Indians, these letters are again written in great detail and even include such matters that they had to make sure that they had enough grains and food for the horses. It tells us about the meals that the General and his comrades ate to sustain them through the campaigns. Each letter is signed off Nomad and the last letter included in this selection is dated 3rd September 1875. They span over an 8 year period in which Custer tells us all about his adventures, successes and in some case failures, such as for example killing his own horse. Some of the content makes it into Custer's 'Life on The Plains' book, which is widely regarded as the outstanding memoir of the Wild West era. Quantity Available: 1.

Item Description: Gallaudet University Press,U.S., United States, 2011. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Reprint. Language: English . This book usually ship within 10-15 business days and we will endeavor to dispatch orders quicker than this where possible. Brand New Book. In 1999, many of today s notable researchers assembled at a special conference in honor of William C. Stokoe to explore the remarkable research that grew out of his original insights on American Sign Language. The Study of Signed Languages presents the fascinating findings from that conference. Part 1, Historical Perspectives, begins with a description of the decline of sign language studies in the 1800s. Past research on signed languages and its relationship to language origins theory follows, along with a consideration of modality and conflicting agendas for its study. In Part 2, Language Origins, the first entry intrigues with the possibility that sign language could answer conundrums posed by Noam Chomsky s linguistic theories. The next essay considers how to build a better language model by citing continuity, ethology, and Stokoe s work as key elements. Stokoe s own research on the gestural theory of language origins is examined in the section s closing chapter. Part 3, Diverse Populations, delineates the impact of sign language research on black deaf communities in America, on deaf education, on research into variation in sign language, and even on sign communication and the motor functioning of autistic children and others. In its wide-ranging, brilliant scholarship, The Study of Signed Languages serves as a fitting tribute to William C. Stokoe and his work.  Bookseller Inventory # BTE9781563685101
