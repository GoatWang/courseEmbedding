  1 At the end of 84 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 7/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  2 At the end of 60 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 5/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  3 SoFi’s interest-only loan is a 30-year, 5/1 ARM loan. During the first 10 interest-only years, the minimum monthly payment required is the interest on the loan. Paying the minimum payment during the interest-only period will not reduce the principal loan balance. At the end of the 10 interest-only years, the minimum payment required will increase, even if the interest rate does not change, to include both interest and principal payments.

Fitch Affirms CGCMT 2014-GC21 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms CGCMT 2014-GC21
    





April 13, 2016 03:26 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 16 classes of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2014-GC21. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable 
      performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, 
      therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the 
      transaction.
    

      As of the March 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 1.5% to $1.02 billion from $1.04 billion at 
      issuance. No loans are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently 
      affecting class G. There are six loans (9%) on the servicer's watchlist, 
      mostly due to deferred maintenance and lease rollover exposure. None of 
      the watchlist loans are considered Fitch Loans of Concern.
    

      The largest loan in the pool is the Maine Mall loan (12.2% of the pool), 
      which is secured by a 1.2 million square foot (sf) regional mall located 
      approximately six miles southwest of Portland, ME. The mall has four 
      anchors: Macy's (non-collateral), Sears (non-collateral), Bon Ton, and 
      JCPenney. There are also junior anchors: Best Buy, Sports Authority, XXI 
      Forever, and Old Navy. The mall also features the only Apple store in 
      the state of Maine. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was reported 
      to be 2.03x as of year-end (YE) 2015. Occupancy was reported to be 97%, 
      which is in line with the occupancy at issuance.
    

      The next largest loan in the pool is the Newcastle Senior Housing 
      Portfolio loan (9.8%). The loan is collateralized by 26 independent 
      living senior housing facilities, totaling 3,002 units. Located across 
      14 states, the portfolio is 100% private pay and offers no assisted 
      living functions. As of September 2015, the DSCR and occupancy was 
      reported to be 1.92x and 93%, respectively, compared to 1.59x and 91% at 
      issuance.
    

      The third largest loan in the pool is the Greene Town Center loan 
      (4.5%), which is secured by an open-air, mixed-use lifestyle center 
      located in Beavercreek, OH, roughly 10 miles southwest of Dayton. The 
      collateral consists of retail (566,634 sf), office (143,343 sf) and 
      residential space (206 units totaling 199,248 sf). Built in phases from 
      2006-2008, the property is anchored by Von Maur (ground lease), Urban 
      Active Fitness (LA Fitness) and Nordstrom Rack. The office and 
      residential portions of the property are located above the retail space 
      on the second floor of the buildings. The DSCR was reported to be 1.86x 
      as of September 2014. Occupancy was reported to be 90%, which is in line 
      with the occupancy at issuance. Updated financial information has been 
      requested. Fitch will continue to closely monitor performance given the 
      outdated reporting for this loan.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable due to stable 
      collateral performance. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative 
      ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes 
      the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    

      --$36.5 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$63.2 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9.6 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$240 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$291.4 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$71.6 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$770.8* million class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$115.7* million class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$58.5 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$70.2 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$0 class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45.5 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24.7* million class X-C at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$50.7 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24.7 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$13 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Notional and interest-only.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class G or X-D certificates. Class A-S, B, and C 
      certificates may be exchanged for a related amount of class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B, and C certificates.

      Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC23 Commercial 
      Mtg P-T Certs; Presale Issued
    





July 15, 2014 12:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued its presale report on Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2014-GC23 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$49,642,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$85,798,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$300,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$345,240,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81,766,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$957,932,000* class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$80,084,000* class X-B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$95,486,000b class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$80,084,000b class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$224,853,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49,283,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,641,000*a class X-C 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$64,683,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,641,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,241,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (*) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for 
      class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of July 8, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $55,443,996*a class 
      X-D, and the $46,202,996a class G certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 83 loans secured by 99 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.23 billion as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Citigroup 
      Global Markets Realty Corp.; Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company; GS 
      Commercial Real Estate LP; MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC; 
      Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation; and Rialto Mortgage Finance, 
      LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.5% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 87%, and asset summary reviews of 88.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Improved Leverage from Recent Transactions: The pool's Fitch debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) are 1.25x and 
      99.4%, respectively, are better than the 2013 and 2014 year-to-date 
      (YTD) averages of 1.29x and 101.6% and 1.19x and 105.6%, respectively.
    

      Large High Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the 
      pool, 28-40 West 23rd (11.4%), has a Fitch credit opinion of 'A-sf' on a 
      stand-alone basis. In the context of the pool, the loan's credit opinion 
      is 'AAAsf'. The loan is collateralized by a 571,205 square foot (sf) 
      mixed-use office and retail building located in Manhattan.
    

      Limited Additional Debt: No loans have subordinate debt in place. The 
      pool has one pari passu loan, Selig Portfolio (7.9%), with the 
      controlling $100 million note securitized in the GSMS 2014-GC21 
      transaction.
    

      Below-Average Amortization: Three of the top five loans are full-term 
      interest-only. As such, the pool has a significantly above-average 
      proportion of interest-only loans (24.4% of the pool balance versus the 
      2013 average of 17.1%) and above-average concentration of partial 
      interest loans (43.7% versus the 2013 average of 34%). The pool is 
      scheduled to amortize 11% prior to maturity.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.8% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI) (for properties for which 
      historical NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during the most recent reporting period). Unanticipated further declines 
      in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the 
      certificates. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      CGCMT 2014-GC23 certificates and found that the transaction displays 
      slightly above-average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a 
      scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a 
      more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's 
      NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could 
      result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 74 - 75.
    

      The master servicer will be Midland Loan Services, Inc., rated 'CMS1' by 
      Fitch. The special servicer will be Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC, rated 
      'CSS2-' by Fitch.
    

      The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

  ✝ To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score.

  1 At the end of 84 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 7/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  2 At the end of 60 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 5/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  3 SoFi’s interest-only loan is a 30-year, 5/1 ARM loan. During the first 10 interest-only years, the minimum monthly payment required is the interest on the loan. Paying the minimum payment during the interest-only period will not reduce the principal loan balance. At the end of the 10 interest-only years, the minimum payment required will increase, even if the interest rate does not change, to include both interest and principal payments.
