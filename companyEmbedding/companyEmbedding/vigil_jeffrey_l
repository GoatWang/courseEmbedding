    LEWISVILLE, Texas, June 14, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Uranium Resources, Inc. (Nasdaq:URRE) (URI) today announced that Jeffrey L. Vigil was appointed Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective June 14, 2013. Mr. Vigil, who most recently was Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer at Energy Fuels Inc.

During his tenure at Energy Fuels, Mr. Vigil held various financial positions including CFO between 2009 and 2012. He managed financial and management reporting, equity financings, tax planning and compliance, treasury functions and risk management for Energy Fuels.

From 1996 to 2007, Mr. Vigil served as CFO for Koala Corporation, which had approximately 350 employees and operated divisions in New York, Florida, Texas, Oregon, Colorado and British Columbia. Mr. Vigil is a graduate of the University of Wyoming with a BS in Accounting and is a licensed Certified Public Accountant in the State of Colorado.   Mr. Ehrlich first joined URI in 1987 and most recently served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for URI.  "Tom has been an invaluable member of the executive team and we thank him for all his contributions and wish him well in his future endeavors," stated Paul K.
