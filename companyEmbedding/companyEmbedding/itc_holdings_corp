We Want Energized Talent









Being part of the ITC team provides the opportunity for challenging and meaningful work by:

Staying focused on operational excellence: Keeping the lights on in a reliable and efficient manner is at the core of what ITC does every day. This extends to all areas of ITC, from the field to finance, and everything in between. Operational excellence really embodies what we do, but it goes a lot deeper than that: It involves measuring everything we do and having a culture of safety, reliability and continuous improvement throughout the company.
Serving our 21st century economy: Electricity is vital to our economy and way of life, and this fact drives our mission as energy transmission providers. At ITC we recognize that our operations affect every customer and that reliance on electricity is greater now than ever before. Our goal is to provide the highest level of system performance.

Focusing on customers: Our goal is to improve the reliability of the grid, provide greater access to markets, mitigate system congestion and ultimately lower the overall delivered cost of energy to customers. In short, we take pride in being a great transmission company for the good of our customers: other utilities, commercial and industrial facilities with a direct connection to ITC, and those who are end-use customers served by local utilities.

Being part of the community: From the employees who maintain our transmission assets and answer calls from our customers, to our leadership team and board of directors, the ITC team is committed to the communities and people we serve. ITC truly believes in being a strong corporate partner, and a good steward of the environment.

Embracing workforce diversity: We are proud of our team’s diversity and we support and encourage our employees to be supporters of diversity and ambassadors of our workplace. To view the EEO is the Law poster, click here.

Q2 Letter From the President






Weathering the Storm

Michigan residents experience extraordinary weather events throughout the year. In early March, wind speeds climbed as high as 68 miles per hour in some areas of the state causing power outages to more than 1 million residents. As we head into the summer months, warm temperatures will present their own challenges. Thanks to the effort and investment we've put into our Michigan systems, we'll be ready to face the challenges head on. Read the full letter.














Simone Whitelocke, Vice President, ITC Holdings Corp., and President, ITC Michigan

ITC Michigan Partners & Recognitions









        ITC's role as the owner and operator of the high voltage transmission system in Michigan's Lower Peninsula requires ongoing communication with a variety of stakeholders – from municipal leaders to residents – about the importance of investing in and securing the nation's transmission assets. Siting, construction and maintenance of transmission projects can be sensitive and controversial; ITC works one-on-one with local communities, assessing the nature of the issues that must be addressed to achieve successful proposals and win-win solutions.
 
Across the ITC Michigan service area, ITC also supports local communities with charitable donations and recreational access to its transmission corridors. Our commitment to the communities we serve is the cornerstone of our business and our mission to be a best-in-class transmission provider.

View the full list of ITC Michigan Partners & Recognitions

Facilitating energy connections with customers in mind.
















ITC Home/ Our Customers














When assessing electric transmission needs for the grid, ITC keeps consumers of energy firmly in mind. Through our investments, we facilitate lower energy costs, increased efficiency and greater reliability. Our customers range from traditional utilities and independent power producers to industrial customers and energy providers looking to connect to the power grid.

 










Staying Connected






Michigan Energy Providers Conference

ITC’s Jon Jipping, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Ron Hinsley, Vice President, Information Technology and Chief Information Officer will be among the presenters at the 61st annual Michigan Energy Providers Conference, July 26-28, 2017. The conference brings together participants from all segments of Michigan’s energy industry to engage in timely issues, facilitate partnerships and foster dialog regarding energy policy in Michigan.














transmission solutions






ITC’s sole focus on transmission allows us to facilitate the reliable and efficient delivery of electricity to our wholesale customers – regardless the generation source. As a result of our sustained investments, ITC’s transmission systems routinely perform in the top tier of utilities nationally for service reliability. Our energy-intensive customers connected to ITC at transmission-level voltage expect nothing less.

Our customers include:


Co-Op: We collaborate with co-ops to identify and build critical transmission projects that deliver reliable, affordable energy to co-op members and the greater region. In cooperation with co-ops, farmers, ranchers and other stewards of the land, we’re modernizing the grid in the nation’s Heartland. Learn more.


Municipal Utilities: Adequate and reliable transmission capacity is a must for municipally owned public power utilities to serve their customers and support economic development. ITC works proactively with municipal utilities to identify issues, solve problems and improve systems. Learn more. 


Investor-Owned, Vertically Integrated Electric Utilities: ITC provides transmission partnership solutions for those utilities choosing to focus on their generation and distribution assets.


Merchant & Transmission Interconnection: ITC believes in a comprehensive planning approach to developing merchant high voltage direct current (HVDC), merchant transmission solutions that complement the AC infrastructure.

ITC Transmission was founded in 1999 as International Transmission Co., a subsidiary of Detroit Edison (since renamed DTE Energy Electric Company, itself a subsidiary of DTE Energy), charged in the ownership, operation and maintenance of Detroit Edison's transmission system. In 2003, DTE sold the subsidiary to ITC Holdings Corp. In 2004, ITC Transmission became the first, fully independent electricity transmission company in the United States following the 2003 transfer of ownership from DTE Energy to ITC Transmission’s parent company, ITC Holdings Corp. ITC Transmission owns a fully regulated, high-voltage system that transmits electricity to local electricity distribution facilities. ITC Holdings Corp. (NYSE: ITC) became a publicly traded company in 2005 and is headquartered in Novi, Michigan. Today it owns transmission systems in several states under a unique independent business model.[1][2][3][4]
On February 9, 2016, it was announced that Fortis Inc., a Canadian utility company based in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, will buy ITC Holdings for about $6.9 billion. The utility operator will also assume $4.4 billion in debt in cash and stock deal. Fortis said it intends to retain all ITC employees and that ITC will continue as a stand-alone operation at its Novi headquarters.[5]

Electric grid systems of ITC Holdings Corp.[edit]
ITC Michigan[edit]
The ITC Michigan system, covering much of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, is composed of transmission systems formerly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison.
The original ITC Transmission system[edit]
The original ITC Transmission system serves areas of southeastern Michigan and the Thumb region served by DTE Electric.
Largely overlapping DTE Electric's area, and launched on March 1, 2003, ITC's transmission line voltages are 345,000 volts, 230,000 volts, 138,000 volts, and 120,000 volts.
ITC has three 345 kV interconnections with First Energy Corporation in Ohio, via that company's Toledo Edison subsidiary (Bayshore-Monroe line, Majestic-Monroe-Allen Junction line, and the Majestic-Lemoyne line). Though owned by ITC these lines reside on towers designed and previously owned by Consumers, as they pass through part of their service area in southern Monroe and southeastern Lenawee Counties.
There are four interconnections with Hydro One in Ontario, Canada—one 345kV (St. Clair-Lambton #1) and three 230kV (Keith-Waterman line, St. Clair-Lambton #2 line and the Bunce Creek-Scott line).
Currently, ITC Transmission is building a new 345 kV line, the "Michigan Thumb Loop", to strengthen the transmission grid in the Thumb Region to serve as a backbone for the interconnection of new generation sources in the area, including wind farms. This project is being built with steel tubular pylons in a double-circuit arrangement. This is scheduled for completion by 2015.[6]
ITC Transmission has 2,800 circuit miles of transmission lines, with 17,700 transmission pylons, and 171 stations and substations.[7] The system has 230 kV lines that cover the Metro Detroit area including Shelby Township in Macomb County where two meet at the Jewell Substation. The recognizable transmission line in the area is the so-called "Edison Corridor":[citation needed] two double-circuit 345 kV lines (portions of it become single circuit) and two 120 kV lines with one heading toward the northeast starting from the Bismark Substation to the Lenox Substation. This corridor extends 20 miles (32 km) through Warren from the Stephens Substation and through Sterling Heights and Utica, and finally Shelby and Washington Townships. ITC Transmission has spent approximately $1.2 billion in capital investments in rebuilding electric infrastructure in the metro-Detroit area since 2003. According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, ITC Transmission was also ranked in the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data.[citation needed]
Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC)[edit]
In October 2006, ITC Holdings Corp. completed the acquisition of METC, or Michigan Electric Transmission Company. Largely overlapping Consumers Energy's area, METC system uses line voltages of 345,000, 230,000 and 138,000 volts. Consumers retained its radial 138 kV lines. METC installed a 230 kV line running from Traverse City northeast to Kalkaska, Michigan particularly made of steel poles with three insulators or conductors, which was the first 230 kV transmission line in its system known as the Keystone to Clearwater 230 kV Line. Though the line was constructed for 230 kV operation, it remains operating at 138 kV until further upgrades are completed.
METC has four 345 kV interconnections with American Electric Power, via AEP's Indiana Michigan Power division: Palisades-Cook #1, Palisades-Cook #2, Argenta-Robinson Park and Argenta-Twin Branch.
METC has six other 138kV interconnections with other utilities: one 138kV interconnection each with Northern Indiana Public Service Company (Barton-Batavia line) and Alpena Power Company; two with the Cloverland Electric Cooperative (on former Edison Sault Electric Company facilities) in the eastern part of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (McGulpin-Straits #1 and McGulpin-Straits #2; these lines are submerged under the Straits of Mackinac); and two 138 kV interconnections with the Lansing Board of Water & Light (Davis-Oneida line and the Davis-Enterprise line). METC also completed capital projects including the 138 kV rebuild project near East Tawas, and the 138 kV Oakland-Tihart line.
METC includes 5,600 circuit miles of transmission lines, with 36,900 transmission towers and poles and 98 stations and substations across the majority of Michigan’s lower peninsula.[7] According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, METC was ranked among the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data.
Interconnections between ITC Transmission and METC[edit]
There are four 345 kV interconnections between the ITC and METC systems to the west of DTE Electric's service area (Majestic-Tompkins line, Majestic-Battle Creek-Oneida line, Jewell-Thetford line, and the Pontiac-Hampton line), plus five 120/138 kV interconnections (the Custer-Whiting line, Genoa-Latson line, Hemphill-Hunters Creek line, Washtenaw-Lark-Blackstone line and the Atlanta-Thetford-Karn line). In addition, the Michigan Thumb Loop line that runs within the DTE service area will interconnect with Consumers / METC's Pontiac-Hampton line at the new Bauer Substation in Tuscola County, northeast of Frankenmuth.[6]
Another major interconnection point between the ITC and METC systems is the Morocco Substation in Deerfield Township in Lenawee County, near the county line with Monroe County. The substation serves to connect the two 138kv Beecher-Whiting circuits that run between Adrian and Consumers' J. R. Whiting Generating Complex on Lake Erie with the 345kv Majestic-Lemoyne line. This is designed to relieve stress on the transmission system after the anticipated closure of the Whiting plant in 2016.[8][9]
ITC Midwest[edit]
ITC Midwest LLC has transmission systems in portions of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois and Missouri. This subsidiary was created on December 20, 2007 with ITC's acquisition of Interstate Power and Light Company's transmission system.[3] ITC Midwest owns and operates 6,600 circuit miles of transmission lines with 262 stations and substations.[7] Since 2008, ITC Midwest has completed 16 new generator interconnects, adding approximately 2,137 megawatts of wind energy production capacity to the grid. This additional amount is more than the total installed wind capacity that existed in Iowa in 2007.
ITC Great Plains[edit]
ITC Great Plains, a transmission-only utility, is a subsidiary of ITC Grid Development, LLC, which in turn is wholly owned by ITC Holdings Corp. ITC Great Plains became an independent transmission company member of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) in September 2006. It is the only ITC Holdings operating company with a “greenfield” business model that is not predicated on acquiring other companies’ systems. ITC Great Plains has current operations in Kansas and Oklahoma.[4][10]
ITC Great Plains owns approximately 190 miles of transmission lines, with approximately 1,168 transmission towers and poles and 5 stations and substations.[7]
ITC Grid Development[edit]
Established in 2006, ITC Grid Development was created to explore new investment opportunities in the nation's transmission grid. This subsidiary is focused on partnering with local entities and utilities to improve electric reliability through infrastructure improvements and a creation of a regional transmission grid.

ITC Transmission was founded in 1999 as International Transmission Co., a subsidiary of Detroit Edison (since renamed DTE Energy Electric Company, itself a subsidiary of DTE Energy), charged in the ownership, operation and maintenance of Detroit Edison's transmission system. In 2003, DTE sold the subsidiary to ITC Holdings Corp. In 2004, ITC Transmission became the first, fully independent electricity transmission company in the United States following the 2003 transfer of ownership from DTE Energy to ITC Transmission’s parent company, ITC Holdings Corp. ITC Transmission owns a fully regulated, high-voltage system that transmits electricity to local electricity distribution facilities. ITC Holdings Corp. (NYSE: ITC) became a publicly traded company in 2005 and is headquartered in Novi, Michigan. Today it owns transmission systems in several states under a unique independent business model.[1][2][3][4]
On February 9, 2016, it was announced that Fortis Inc., a Canadian utility company based in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, will buy ITC Holdings for about $6.9 billion. The utility operator will also assume $4.4 billion in debt in cash and stock deal. Fortis said it intends to retain all ITC employees and that ITC will continue as a stand-alone operation at its Novi headquarters.[5]

Electric grid systems of ITC Holdings Corp.[edit]
ITC Michigan[edit]
The ITC Michigan system, covering much of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, is composed of transmission systems formerly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison.
The original ITC Transmission system[edit]
The original ITC Transmission system serves areas of southeastern Michigan and the Thumb region served by DTE Electric.
Largely overlapping DTE Electric's area, and launched on March 1, 2003, ITC's transmission line voltages are 345,000 volts, 230,000 volts, 138,000 volts, and 120,000 volts.
ITC has three 345 kV interconnections with First Energy Corporation in Ohio, via that company's Toledo Edison subsidiary (Bayshore-Monroe line, Majestic-Monroe-Allen Junction line, and the Majestic-Lemoyne line). Though owned by ITC these lines reside on towers designed and previously owned by Consumers, as they pass through part of their service area in southern Monroe and southeastern Lenawee Counties.
There are four interconnections with Hydro One in Ontario, Canada—one 345kV (St. Clair-Lambton #1) and three 230kV (Keith-Waterman line, St. Clair-Lambton #2 line and the Bunce Creek-Scott line).
Currently, ITC Transmission is building a new 345 kV line, the "Michigan Thumb Loop", to strengthen the transmission grid in the Thumb Region to serve as a backbone for the interconnection of new generation sources in the area, including wind farms. This project is being built with steel tubular pylons in a double-circuit arrangement. This is scheduled for completion by 2015.[6]
ITC Transmission has 2,800 circuit miles of transmission lines, with 17,700 transmission pylons, and 171 stations and substations.[7] The system has 230 kV lines that cover the Metro Detroit area including Shelby Township in Macomb County where two meet at the Jewell Substation. The recognizable transmission line in the area is the so-called "Edison Corridor":[citation needed] two double-circuit 345 kV lines (portions of it become single circuit) and two 120 kV lines with one heading toward the northeast starting from the Bismark Substation to the Lenox Substation. This corridor extends 20 miles (32 km) through Warren from the Stephens Substation and through Sterling Heights and Utica, and finally Shelby and Washington Townships. ITC Transmission has spent approximately $1.2 billion in capital investments in rebuilding electric infrastructure in the metro-Detroit area since 2003. According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, ITC Transmission was also ranked in the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data.[citation needed]
Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC)[edit]
In October 2006, ITC Holdings Corp. completed the acquisition of METC, or Michigan Electric Transmission Company. Largely overlapping Consumers Energy's area, METC system uses line voltages of 345,000, 230,000 and 138,000 volts. Consumers retained its radial 138 kV lines. METC installed a 230 kV line running from Traverse City northeast to Kalkaska, Michigan particularly made of steel poles with three insulators or conductors, which was the first 230 kV transmission line in its system known as the Keystone to Clearwater 230 kV Line. Though the line was constructed for 230 kV operation, it remains operating at 138 kV until further upgrades are completed.
METC has four 345 kV interconnections with American Electric Power, via AEP's Indiana Michigan Power division: Palisades-Cook #1, Palisades-Cook #2, Argenta-Robinson Park and Argenta-Twin Branch.
METC has six other 138kV interconnections with other utilities: one 138kV interconnection each with Northern Indiana Public Service Company (Barton-Batavia line) and Alpena Power Company; two with the Cloverland Electric Cooperative (on former Edison Sault Electric Company facilities) in the eastern part of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (McGulpin-Straits #1 and McGulpin-Straits #2; these lines are submerged under the Straits of Mackinac); and two 138 kV interconnections with the Lansing Board of Water & Light (Davis-Oneida line and the Davis-Enterprise line). METC also completed capital projects including the 138 kV rebuild project near East Tawas, and the 138 kV Oakland-Tihart line.
METC includes 5,600 circuit miles of transmission lines, with 36,900 transmission towers and poles and 98 stations and substations across the majority of Michigan’s lower peninsula.[7] According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, METC was ranked among the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data.
Interconnections between ITC Transmission and METC[edit]
There are four 345 kV interconnections between the ITC and METC systems to the west of DTE Electric's service area (Majestic-Tompkins line, Majestic-Battle Creek-Oneida line, Jewell-Thetford line, and the Pontiac-Hampton line), plus five 120/138 kV interconnections (the Custer-Whiting line, Genoa-Latson line, Hemphill-Hunters Creek line, Washtenaw-Lark-Blackstone line and the Atlanta-Thetford-Karn line). In addition, the Michigan Thumb Loop line that runs within the DTE service area will interconnect with Consumers / METC's Pontiac-Hampton line at the new Bauer Substation in Tuscola County, northeast of Frankenmuth.[6]
Another major interconnection point between the ITC and METC systems is the Morocco Substation in Deerfield Township in Lenawee County, near the county line with Monroe County. The substation serves to connect the two 138kv Beecher-Whiting circuits that run between Adrian and Consumers' J. R. Whiting Generating Complex on Lake Erie with the 345kv Majestic-Lemoyne line. This is designed to relieve stress on the transmission system after the anticipated closure of the Whiting plant in 2016.[8][9]
ITC Midwest[edit]
ITC Midwest LLC has transmission systems in portions of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois and Missouri. This subsidiary was created on December 20, 2007 with ITC's acquisition of Interstate Power and Light Company's transmission system.[3] ITC Midwest owns and operates 6,600 circuit miles of transmission lines with 262 stations and substations.[7] Since 2008, ITC Midwest has completed 16 new generator interconnects, adding approximately 2,137 megawatts of wind energy production capacity to the grid. This additional amount is more than the total installed wind capacity that existed in Iowa in 2007.
ITC Great Plains[edit]
ITC Great Plains, a transmission-only utility, is a subsidiary of ITC Grid Development, LLC, which in turn is wholly owned by ITC Holdings Corp. ITC Great Plains became an independent transmission company member of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) in September 2006. It is the only ITC Holdings operating company with a “greenfield” business model that is not predicated on acquiring other companies’ systems. ITC Great Plains has current operations in Kansas and Oklahoma.[4][10]
ITC Great Plains owns approximately 190 miles of transmission lines, with approximately 1,168 transmission towers and poles and 5 stations and substations.[7]
ITC Grid Development[edit]
Established in 2006, ITC Grid Development was created to explore new investment opportunities in the nation's transmission grid. This subsidiary is focused on partnering with local entities and utilities to improve electric reliability through infrastructure improvements and a creation of a regional transmission grid.

ITC Transmission was founded in 1999 as International Transmission Co., a subsidiary of Detroit Edison (since renamed DTE Energy Electric Company, itself a subsidiary of DTE Energy), charged in the ownership, operation and maintenance of Detroit Edison's transmission system. In 2003, DTE sold the subsidiary to ITC Holdings Corp. In 2004, ITC Transmission became the first, fully independent electricity transmission company in the United States following the 2003 transfer of ownership from DTE Energy to ITC Transmission’s parent company, ITC Holdings Corp. ITC Transmission owns a fully regulated, high-voltage system that transmits electricity to local electricity distribution facilities. ITC Holdings Corp. (NYSE: ITC) became a publicly traded company in 2005 and is headquartered in Novi, Michigan. Today it owns transmission systems in several states under a unique independent business model.[1][2][3][4]
On February 9, 2016, it was announced that Fortis Inc., a Canadian utility company based in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, will buy ITC Holdings for about $6.9 billion. The utility operator will also assume $4.4 billion in debt in cash and stock deal. Fortis said it intends to retain all ITC employees and that ITC will continue as a stand-alone operation at its Novi headquarters.[5]

Electric grid systems of ITC Holdings Corp.[edit]
ITC Michigan[edit]
The ITC Michigan system, covering much of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, is composed of transmission systems formerly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison.
The original ITC Transmission system[edit]
The original ITC Transmission system serves areas of southeastern Michigan and the Thumb region served by DTE Electric.
Largely overlapping DTE Electric's area, and launched on March 1, 2003, ITC's transmission line voltages are 345,000 volts, 230,000 volts, 138,000 volts, and 120,000 volts.
ITC has three 345 kV interconnections with First Energy Corporation in Ohio, via that company's Toledo Edison subsidiary (Bayshore-Monroe line, Majestic-Monroe-Allen Junction line, and the Majestic-Lemoyne line). Though owned by ITC these lines reside on towers designed and previously owned by Consumers, as they pass through part of their service area in southern Monroe and southeastern Lenawee Counties.
There are four interconnections with Hydro One in Ontario, Canada—one 345kV (St. Clair-Lambton #1) and three 230kV (Keith-Waterman line, St. Clair-Lambton #2 line and the Bunce Creek-Scott line).
Currently, ITC Transmission is building a new 345 kV line, the "Michigan Thumb Loop", to strengthen the transmission grid in the Thumb Region to serve as a backbone for the interconnection of new generation sources in the area, including wind farms. This project is being built with steel tubular pylons in a double-circuit arrangement. This is scheduled for completion by 2015.[6]
ITC Transmission has 2,800 circuit miles of transmission lines, with 17,700 transmission pylons, and 171 stations and substations.[7] The system has 230 kV lines that cover the Metro Detroit area including Shelby Township in Macomb County where two meet at the Jewell Substation. The recognizable transmission line in the area is the so-called "Edison Corridor":[citation needed] two double-circuit 345 kV lines (portions of it become single circuit) and two 120 kV lines with one heading toward the northeast starting from the Bismark Substation to the Lenox Substation. This corridor extends 20 miles (32 km) through Warren from the Stephens Substation and through Sterling Heights and Utica, and finally Shelby and Washington Townships. ITC Transmission has spent approximately $1.2 billion in capital investments in rebuilding electric infrastructure in the metro-Detroit area since 2003. According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, ITC Transmission was also ranked in the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data.[citation needed]
Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC)[edit]
In October 2006, ITC Holdings Corp. completed the acquisition of METC, or Michigan Electric Transmission Company. Largely overlapping Consumers Energy's area, METC system uses line voltages of 345,000, 230,000 and 138,000 volts. Consumers retained its radial 138 kV lines. METC installed a 230 kV line running from Traverse City northeast to Kalkaska, Michigan particularly made of steel poles with three insulators or conductors, which was the first 230 kV transmission line in its system known as the Keystone to Clearwater 230 kV Line. Though the line was constructed for 230 kV operation, it remains operating at 138 kV until further upgrades are completed.
METC has four 345 kV interconnections with American Electric Power, via AEP's Indiana Michigan Power division: Palisades-Cook #1, Palisades-Cook #2, Argenta-Robinson Park and Argenta-Twin Branch.
METC has six other 138kV interconnections with other utilities: one 138kV interconnection each with Northern Indiana Public Service Company (Barton-Batavia line) and Alpena Power Company; two with the Cloverland Electric Cooperative (on former Edison Sault Electric Company facilities) in the eastern part of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (McGulpin-Straits #1 and McGulpin-Straits #2; these lines are submerged under the Straits of Mackinac); and two 138 kV interconnections with the Lansing Board of Water & Light (Davis-Oneida line and the Davis-Enterprise line). METC also completed capital projects including the 138 kV rebuild project near East Tawas, and the 138 kV Oakland-Tihart line.
METC includes 5,600 circuit miles of transmission lines, with 36,900 transmission towers and poles and 98 stations and substations across the majority of Michigan’s lower peninsula.[7] According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, METC was ranked among the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data.
Interconnections between ITC Transmission and METC[edit]
There are four 345 kV interconnections between the ITC and METC systems to the west of DTE Electric's service area (Majestic-Tompkins line, Majestic-Battle Creek-Oneida line, Jewell-Thetford line, and the Pontiac-Hampton line), plus five 120/138 kV interconnections (the Custer-Whiting line, Genoa-Latson line, Hemphill-Hunters Creek line, Washtenaw-Lark-Blackstone line and the Atlanta-Thetford-Karn line). In addition, the Michigan Thumb Loop line that runs within the DTE service area will interconnect with Consumers / METC's Pontiac-Hampton line at the new Bauer Substation in Tuscola County, northeast of Frankenmuth.[6]
Another major interconnection point between the ITC and METC systems is the Morocco Substation in Deerfield Township in Lenawee County, near the county line with Monroe County. The substation serves to connect the two 138kv Beecher-Whiting circuits that run between Adrian and Consumers' J. R. Whiting Generating Complex on Lake Erie with the 345kv Majestic-Lemoyne line. This is designed to relieve stress on the transmission system after the anticipated closure of the Whiting plant in 2016.[8][9]
ITC Midwest[edit]
ITC Midwest LLC has transmission systems in portions of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois and Missouri. This subsidiary was created on December 20, 2007 with ITC's acquisition of Interstate Power and Light Company's transmission system.[3] ITC Midwest owns and operates 6,600 circuit miles of transmission lines with 262 stations and substations.[7] Since 2008, ITC Midwest has completed 16 new generator interconnects, adding approximately 2,137 megawatts of wind energy production capacity to the grid. This additional amount is more than the total installed wind capacity that existed in Iowa in 2007.
ITC Great Plains[edit]
ITC Great Plains, a transmission-only utility, is a subsidiary of ITC Grid Development, LLC, which in turn is wholly owned by ITC Holdings Corp. ITC Great Plains became an independent transmission company member of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) in September 2006. It is the only ITC Holdings operating company with a “greenfield” business model that is not predicated on acquiring other companies’ systems. ITC Great Plains has current operations in Kansas and Oklahoma.[4][10]
ITC Great Plains owns approximately 190 miles of transmission lines, with approximately 1,168 transmission towers and poles and 5 stations and substations.[7]
ITC Grid Development[edit]
Established in 2006, ITC Grid Development was created to explore new investment opportunities in the nation's transmission grid. This subsidiary is focused on partnering with local entities and utilities to improve electric reliability through infrastructure improvements and a creation of a regional transmission grid.

ITC Transmission was founded in 1999 as International Transmission Co., a subsidiary of Detroit Edison (since renamed DTE Energy Electric Company, itself a subsidiary of DTE Energy), charged in the ownership, operation and maintenance of Detroit Edison's transmission system. In 2003, DTE sold the subsidiary to ITC Holdings Corp. In 2004, ITC Transmission became the first, fully independent electricity transmission company in the United States following the 2003 transfer of ownership from DTE Energy to ITC Transmission’s parent company, ITC Holdings Corp. ITC Transmission owns a fully regulated, high-voltage system that transmits electricity to local electricity distribution facilities. ITC Holdings Corp. (NYSE: ITC) became a publicly traded company in 2005 and is headquartered in Novi, Michigan. Today it owns transmission systems in several states under a unique independent business model.[1][2][3][4]
On February 9, 2016, it was announced that Fortis Inc., a Canadian utility company based in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, will buy ITC Holdings for about $6.9 billion. The utility operator will also assume $4.4 billion in debt in cash and stock deal. Fortis said it intends to retain all ITC employees and that ITC will continue as a stand-alone operation at its Novi headquarters.[5]

Electric grid systems of ITC Holdings Corp.[edit]
ITC Michigan[edit]
The ITC Michigan system, covering much of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, is composed of transmission systems formerly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison.
The original ITC Transmission system[edit]
The original ITC Transmission system serves areas of southeastern Michigan and the Thumb region served by DTE Electric.
Largely overlapping DTE Electric's area, and launched on March 1, 2003, ITC's transmission line voltages are 345,000 volts, 230,000 volts, 138,000 volts, and 120,000 volts.
ITC has three 345 kV interconnections with First Energy Corporation in Ohio, via that company's Toledo Edison subsidiary (Bayshore-Monroe line, Majestic-Monroe-Allen Junction line, and the Majestic-Lemoyne line). Though owned by ITC these lines reside on towers designed and previously owned by Consumers, as they pass through part of their service area in southern Monroe and southeastern Lenawee Counties.
There are four interconnections with Hydro One in Ontario, Canada—one 345kV (St. Clair-Lambton #1) and three 230kV (Keith-Waterman line, St. Clair-Lambton #2 line and the Bunce Creek-Scott line).
Currently, ITC Transmission is building a new 345 kV line, the "Michigan Thumb Loop", to strengthen the transmission grid in the Thumb Region to serve as a backbone for the interconnection of new generation sources in the area, including wind farms. This project is being built with steel tubular pylons in a double-circuit arrangement. This is scheduled for completion by 2015.[6]
ITC Transmission has 2,800 circuit miles of transmission lines, with 17,700 transmission pylons, and 171 stations and substations.[7] The system has 230 kV lines that cover the Metro Detroit area including Shelby Township in Macomb County where two meet at the Jewell Substation. The recognizable transmission line in the area is the so-called "Edison Corridor":[citation needed] two double-circuit 345 kV lines (portions of it become single circuit) and two 120 kV lines with one heading toward the northeast starting from the Bismark Substation to the Lenox Substation. This corridor extends 20 miles (32 km) through Warren from the Stephens Substation and through Sterling Heights and Utica, and finally Shelby and Washington Townships. ITC Transmission has spent approximately $1.2 billion in capital investments in rebuilding electric infrastructure in the metro-Detroit area since 2003. According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, ITC Transmission was also ranked in the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data.[citation needed]
Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC)[edit]
In October 2006, ITC Holdings Corp. completed the acquisition of METC, or Michigan Electric Transmission Company. Largely overlapping Consumers Energy's area, METC system uses line voltages of 345,000, 230,000 and 138,000 volts. Consumers retained its radial 138 kV lines. METC installed a 230 kV line running from Traverse City northeast to Kalkaska, Michigan particularly made of steel poles with three insulators or conductors, which was the first 230 kV transmission line in its system known as the Keystone to Clearwater 230 kV Line. Though the line was constructed for 230 kV operation, it remains operating at 138 kV until further upgrades are completed.
METC has four 345 kV interconnections with American Electric Power, via AEP's Indiana Michigan Power division: Palisades-Cook #1, Palisades-Cook #2, Argenta-Robinson Park and Argenta-Twin Branch.
METC has six other 138kV interconnections with other utilities: one 138kV interconnection each with Northern Indiana Public Service Company (Barton-Batavia line) and Alpena Power Company; two with the Cloverland Electric Cooperative (on former Edison Sault Electric Company facilities) in the eastern part of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (McGulpin-Straits #1 and McGulpin-Straits #2; these lines are submerged under the Straits of Mackinac); and two 138 kV interconnections with the Lansing Board of Water & Light (Davis-Oneida line and the Davis-Enterprise line). METC also completed capital projects including the 138 kV rebuild project near East Tawas, and the 138 kV Oakland-Tihart line.
METC includes 5,600 circuit miles of transmission lines, with 36,900 transmission towers and poles and 98 stations and substations across the majority of Michigan’s lower peninsula.[7] According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, METC was ranked among the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data.
Interconnections between ITC Transmission and METC[edit]
There are four 345 kV interconnections between the ITC and METC systems to the west of DTE Electric's service area (Majestic-Tompkins line, Majestic-Battle Creek-Oneida line, Jewell-Thetford line, and the Pontiac-Hampton line), plus five 120/138 kV interconnections (the Custer-Whiting line, Genoa-Latson line, Hemphill-Hunters Creek line, Washtenaw-Lark-Blackstone line and the Atlanta-Thetford-Karn line). In addition, the Michigan Thumb Loop line that runs within the DTE service area will interconnect with Consumers / METC's Pontiac-Hampton line at the new Bauer Substation in Tuscola County, northeast of Frankenmuth.[6]
Another major interconnection point between the ITC and METC systems is the Morocco Substation in Deerfield Township in Lenawee County, near the county line with Monroe County. The substation serves to connect the two 138kv Beecher-Whiting circuits that run between Adrian and Consumers' J. R. Whiting Generating Complex on Lake Erie with the 345kv Majestic-Lemoyne line. This is designed to relieve stress on the transmission system after the anticipated closure of the Whiting plant in 2016.[8][9]
ITC Midwest[edit]
ITC Midwest LLC has transmission systems in portions of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois and Missouri. This subsidiary was created on December 20, 2007 with ITC's acquisition of Interstate Power and Light Company's transmission system.[3] ITC Midwest owns and operates 6,600 circuit miles of transmission lines with 262 stations and substations.[7] Since 2008, ITC Midwest has completed 16 new generator interconnects, adding approximately 2,137 megawatts of wind energy production capacity to the grid. This additional amount is more than the total installed wind capacity that existed in Iowa in 2007.
ITC Great Plains[edit]
ITC Great Plains, a transmission-only utility, is a subsidiary of ITC Grid Development, LLC, which in turn is wholly owned by ITC Holdings Corp. ITC Great Plains became an independent transmission company member of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) in September 2006. It is the only ITC Holdings operating company with a “greenfield” business model that is not predicated on acquiring other companies’ systems. ITC Great Plains has current operations in Kansas and Oklahoma.[4][10]
ITC Great Plains owns approximately 190 miles of transmission lines, with approximately 1,168 transmission towers and poles and 5 stations and substations.[7]
ITC Grid Development[edit]
Established in 2006, ITC Grid Development was created to explore new investment opportunities in the nation's transmission grid. This subsidiary is focused on partnering with local entities and utilities to improve electric reliability through infrastructure improvements and a creation of a regional transmission grid.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
