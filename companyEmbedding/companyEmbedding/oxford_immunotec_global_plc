"We are extremely pleased to welcome Rick to the team during this exciting time at Oxford Immunotec," said CEO, Dr. Peter Wrighton-Smith. "Rick's extensive leadership experience and the depth and breadth of his clinical, scientific, and commercial expertise will be immensely valuable as we continue to grow our core tuberculosis franchise and launch products into the new markets of tick-borne diseases, blood screening and transplantation."
Prior to joining Myriad Genetics, Dr. Wenstrup served as a tenured Professor of Pediatrics (Human Genetics) at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and as a tenured Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati. During his time in academia, Dr. Wenstrup was principal investigator on multiple research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA Orphan Products Grant Program. He also served as a standing member of NIH review committees and on the scientific advisory boards of several disease-related foundations.

About Us
Oxford Immunotec Global PLC is a global, high-growth diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing proprietary tests for the management of underserved immune-regulated conditions. The Company’s first product is the TSPOT®.TB test, which is used to test for tuberculosis infection. The T-SPOT.TB test has been approved for sale in over 50 countries, including the United States, where it has received pre-market approval from the Food and Drug Administration, Europe, where it has obtained a CE mark, as well as Japan and China. The Company’s second product line is a range of assays for tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, obtained through the acquisitions of Imugen and Immunetics. Also obtained through the acquisitions is the Company’s third product line focused on screening for Babesia in donated blood, for which the Company is currently seeking FDA licensure. The T-SPOT.CMV test and the T-SPOT.PRT test are pipeline products as part of the Company’s fourth intended product line focused on the transplantation market. In addition to these four product lines, the Company has additional active development programs in other immune-regulated conditions. The Company is headquartered near Oxford, U.K. and in Marlborough, Mass. Additional information can be found at www.oxfordimmunotec.com.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Discovery of the health benefits of Immunocal
At the beginning of the 70’s, under the direction of Gustavo Bounous, MD, (FRCSC), a team of researchers from the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University (Canada), was studying proteins of animal and vegetable origins in order to feed the patients with an elemental diet that would allow them to reduce their stay in hospital.

Living Longer, Living Stronger

Glutathione supplementation - manipulation of natural defense mechanismsin health and disease
The human body is one of nature’s finest miracles and researchers are still unlocking many of its secrets. Recent discoveries have shed important light on the role that glutathione plays in maintaining health…

The Science of Glutathione
Glutathione is a small molecule found in almost every cell. It cannot enter most cells directly and therefore must be made inside the cell, from its three constituent amino acids: glycine, glutamate and cysteine. The rate at which glutathione can be made…

        RMF's inclusion of creatine helps to maintain proper muscle function.*
These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease.



Many natural products claim to either raise glutathione, to have antioxidant power, or to improve our immune function. What should you consider when making an intelligent and informed choice:

Immunocal Platinum contains Immunocal.
The Natural Health Products Directorate of Health Canada has issued an Natural Product Number (NPN-80028731) for the specific health claim "Immunocal Platinum is a source of glutathione precursor for the maintenance of a strong immune system. Helps to maintain proper muscle function and bone health by reducing calcium loss.  Also used as an electrolyte and mineral supplement for the maintenance of good health."
Immunocal scientific studies have been published in many of the most trusted and prestigious medical journals. 
Immunocal is backed up by over 40 years of clinical research and testing.
Immunocal is listed in the:

Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR): This official reference book sits in the office of virtually every doctor and pharmacist in America, as it lists all the substances a doctor can prescribe.
Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS): Immunocal is listed in this Canadian reference book.


Immunocal is recognized by some of the world’s most respected doctors and researchers:

Dr. James F. Balch, prominent authority on nutrition and best-selling author of “Prescription for Nutritional Healing” states that “It’s my opinion that everyone should be taking Immunocal. Today, there’s no better way to boost your immune system.”
Dr. Wulf Dröge, international expert on immunology, cell biology, antioxidants and aging, stated: “Many studies... support the conclusion that Immunocal is effective in maintaining a strong immune system... people are well advised to consume Immunocal regularly.”


Immunocal is used by a rapidly-growing number of top professional and amateur athletes (including Olympic Athletes) worldwide, to maintain their health and improve performance.
Only Immunocal Platinum contains CMP and RMF. Two components developed by some of the top scientists in the field.

What is Immunocal?
Immunocal is an all-natural protein derived from milk. It is a specially-prepared whey protein isolate.
What is Immunocal Platinum?
It is Immunocal with two additional components added: CMP and RMF.
What is CMP?
CMP stands for "Cytokine Modulating Proteins". Cytokines are small biologically active proteins that act as signals in the immune system to regulate inflammation.
What is RMF?
RMF stands for "Redox Modulating Formula". Developed by Dr. Wulf Droge, RMF includes a proprietary blend of citrate minerals, which act to lower acidity levels in the body and to restore its natural pH balance. This serves to support the strength of bones as we age and contributes to your overall well-being. RMF also includes a very small amount of creatine, which helps to maintain proper muscle function.
If someone is lactose intolerant, can they take Immunocal Platinum?
Yes, the lactose in Immunocal Platinum is removed during its production. Less than 1% lactose remains and legally the product can be called "lactose-free". It should be noted that being lactose-intolerant is different than having a milk protein allergy (see below).
If someone has a milk allergy, can they take Immunocal Platinum?
Most people who claim they have a milk "allergy" are actually not allergic, they are lactose intolerant. If this is the case, they can take Immunocal Platinum. If they have a true allergy to milk proteins, they should avoid it. However, the majority of milk protein allergies (80%) are to a protein called "caseine". There is very little caseine in Immunocal Platinum (generally less than 1.5%).
Can Immunocal Platinum be mixed with Immunocal?
Immunocal regular and Immunocal Platinum can be mixed together if desired.
What is "whey"?
Whey is a group of proteins found in milk.
What is a whey protein "isolate"?
Whey proteins can be produced in different concentrations. "Regular" whey protein can be anywhere from 20% to 70%. Whey protein "concentrates" are between 70% and 90%. A whey protein "isolate" is over 90% pure protein. Technically this is difficult and expensive to achieve without harming the protein's structure.
Why is a whey protein isolate desirable?
Only isolates have thoroughly removed from them the fat, fat-soluble toxins, water, water-soluble toxins, lactose, and other contaminants from the protein. It is the "purest" form of protein.
There are other whey protein isolates on the market. How is Immunocal Platinum different?
Immunocal is supported with extensive research published in medical journals.
				Immunocal is produced in a special way to preserve the proteins' natural structure so that it retains its profound effect on your cells.
				Immunocal is clinically proven to work in human beings.
				Immunocal appears in the American PDR (Physicians' Desk Reference).
				Immunocal appears in the Canadian CPS (Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties).
How does the manufacture of Immunocal Platinum differ from other whey proteins?
Immunotec's proprietary manufacturing process preserves the critical disulfide bonds in the glutathione precursor cysteine.  By delivering this delicate protein to the cell, it enables the body to create glutathione and maximize immune system levels.  Other whey proteins are often manufactured using high heat (pasteurization) and harsh methods of mixing, resulting in a denatured and ineffective product.
What does undenatured mean?
Undenatured means that a protein is not damaged or significantly changed from the way it appears in nature. Immunocal Platinum works by providing important glutathione precursors to the cell.  It is critical that these precursors remain intact or undenatured during the manufacturing and mixing processes in order to enhance the immune system.  That is why we recommend that Immunocal Platinum not be heated or subject to harsh mixing in order to preserve it bioactivity.
Do other whey protein isolates work?
As a source of amino acids, whey protein has a superior nutritional advantage over other types of protein. All whey protein isolates are a good source of protein. However, there are many other variables that need to be considered in a whey's quality. Most importantly is the degree in which the protein resembles its original form in nature. This is easily altered in the harvesting, manufacturing, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control of the product. Other whey protein isolates have not been thoroughly tested in clinical trials done on human beings, so it's anybody's guess as to whether they work or not.
What does Immunocal Platinum do?
Immunocal Platinum is a natural source of the glutathione precursor cysteine for the maintenance of a strong immune system and helps to maintain proper muscle function and bone health by reducing calcium loss.
How does Immunocal Platinum work?
Immunocal Platinum supplies the rare building blocks (precursors) for your cells to make glutathione.
				Immunocal Platinum supplies all the essential amino acids required by your cells and tissues.
				Immunocal Platinum supplies other peptides (small proteins) critical for many aspects of your health.
What is glutathione?
It is a substance that is produced by your own cells that is fundamental to life. Glutathione plays many roles, the most important of which are:
				
It is your body's master antioxidant.
GSH plays a determinant role in the proper functioning of the immune system.


Why can't a person just eat glutathione?
Glutathione is broken down by digestion and very little if any can get from your mouth to your cell where it's needed. To raise glutathione effectively, you must give your cells the building blocks (precursors) to make glutathione yourself.
How have the benefits of Immunocal Platinum been proven? How do we know it works?
Immunocal has had research performed starting as far back as the late 1970's at McGill University (Canada's foremost Medical School). There continues to be much effort in publishing human clinical trials in respected peer-reviewed medical journals worldwide. These articles are easily available on-line.
What is a "peer-reviewed" journal?
"Peer-reviewed" means that an article is scrutinized and criticized for quality and validity by other doctors and scientists before it can be published. Articles that don't stand up to this scrutiny are rejected. Most submissions are initially rejected. This screens for misguided or inaccurate statements.
How many articles have been published about Immunocal?
This is a moving target that grows every year. As of summer 2012 there have been over 35 articles published.
What are the "PDR and "CPS"?
The American PDR (Physicians' Desk Reference) and the Canadian CPS (Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties) are published yearly and distributed to all the doctors and pharmacists in the country. It holds all the prescribing information for drugs, however, Immunocal Platinum is not a drug. It is one of the rare natural substances that hold a position in these publications.
There are other whey protein isolates that claim to have research as well. True?
When this "research" is actually examined, usually you will find:
				
That they are quoting work done by Dr. Bounous, Kongshavn, Droge or other prominent scientists done on Immunocal. This does not mean that their products work as well.
They are experiments done in a laboratory or on laboratory animals, not in human beings.


Who can NOT take Immunocal Platinum?
Anyone with a specific allergy to the components.
				This does NOT include lactose. Immunocal contains less than 1% lactose. It is usually tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals.
				Anyone taking immunosuppressant medication to avoid rejection of an organ transplant.
				Always ask your health professional before taking any supplements.
Can pregnant or lactating women take Immunocal Platinum?
No adverse effects have been reported. A health care practitioner should be consulted prior to use if the person is pregnant or has reason to believe she is, or if she is breastfeeding.
Can geriatric clients take Immunocal Platinum?
Yes, glutathione levels drop with age. 
Are there side effects?
Immunocal Platinum is a natural source of protein classified as a Natural Health Product. Gastrointestinal bloating and cramps are possible if the product is not sufficiently rehydrated. Transient urticarial-like skin rash has been reported in rare individuals undergoing severe detoxification reaction. Skin rash abates when the intake is stopped or reduced.
Can you overdose on Immunocal Platinum?
There have been no reports of toxicity from overdosing on Immunocal Platinum. Glutathione is a tightly regulated intracellular constituent and is limited in its production by negative feedback inhibition of its own synthesis through the enzyme gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, thus greatly minimizing any possibility of overdose.
Are there liquids that CAN NOT be used to mix with Immunocal Platinum?
Avoid hot liquids and extremely acidic liquids.
Can I use a blender to mix Immunocal Platinum?
Power blenders should generally be avoided. Small, low-speed, hand-held plastic blenders are acceptable.
How long is Immunocal Platinum good for once it has been mixed?
As a general guideline, consume shortly after mixing, preferably within 30 minutes. It is best kept cool while waiting.
Can Immunocal Platinum be mixed with milk?
Immunocal Platinum can be mixed with milk but may taste salty or sour in milk. This is why the label recommends not mixing with milk. However, if you like the taste, it is not a problem.
When is the best time to take Immunocal Platinum?
Most people take Immunocal Platinum first thing in the morning or after your body has been fasting for a few hours. This will enhance protein absorption and amino acid utilization. If you are taking multiple pouches per day, these can be taken at separate times.
If I am taking several pouches of Immunocal Platinum per day, can I take them all at once?
Yes.
Does Immunocal contain any Pesticides or Antibiotic?
Immunocal Platinum does not contain antibiotics or pesticide residues.
Is there any danger of "Mad Cow Disease" /Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)?
No. Because of concerns about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) the cattle are continuously surveyed for evidence of the disease.  Immunotec Platinum herds also fully participate in the Federal Mammalian Protein Feeding Ban.  Feeding the cows with proteins of ruminants is prohibited the United States. Immunocal is certified free of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
How should Immunocal Platinum be stored?
Immunocal Platinum should be stored in a cool dry place to maximize shelf-life and preserve efficacy; we suggest temperatures of 70-90°F (21-32°C).
How much raw milk does it take to make Immunocal Platinum?
We need 300 liters (79.25 US gallons) of fresh, raw milk to produce 1 kilogram (2.2 lbs.) of Immunocal Platinum.  It is produced using a gentle process and low temperatures to preserve the biological activity of the proteins.
What is the difference between taking Immunocal Platinum as opposed to taking other antioxidants?
Immunocal Platinum, as such, is not an antioxidant but provides the building blocks for the synthesis of glutathione, which is the principal intracellular antioxidant. Immunocal Platinum also contains CMP and RMF.

Benefits

Immunocal is a natural source of the glutathione precursor cysteine for the maintenance of a strong immune system.
Immunocal proteins have a very high BV (Biological Value).
Helps increase muscle strength and performance when combined with regular exercise.
Source of protein which helps build and repair body tissues and build antibodies.
Source of essential amino acids for the maintenance of good health.
Workout supplement/athletic support.
Assists in the building of lean muscle when combined with regular training and a healthy and balanced diet.


Immunocal is a specially formulated protein derived from whey. It contains glutathione building blocks.
How does Immunocal work? The immune system is incredibly complex, but a major cornerstone relies on its ability to obtain a molecule called glutathione. Glutathione exists in every cell of your body and is essential for life and critical for health. This molecule is constantly being used up in dozens of your body's functions and is difficult to replace. Glutathione is your body's master antioxidant, its chief detoxification enzyme and is literally food for the immune system. Immunocal is a natural source of the glutathione precursor cysteine for the maintenance of a strong immune system.
Many natural products are available that claim to help your immune system, but very few have undergone the rigorous testing and published human trials that Immunotec has accomplished over the years. Over forty published scientific and medical articles attest to its remarkable credibility.
Besides its ability to raise glutathione and all the benefits that come with it, Immunocal proteins have a very high BV (Biological Value).
These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease.



Many natural products claim to either raise glutathione, to have antioxidant power, or to improve our immune function. What should you consider when making an intelligent and informed choice:

Immunocal is backed up by over 40 years of clinical research and testing.
The Natural Health Products Directorate of Health Canada has issued an Natural Product Number (NPN-80004370) for the specific health claim "Immunocal is a natural source of the glutathione precursor cysteine for the maintenance of a strong immune system."
Immunocal first to be granted strength and performance claim for a stand-alone whey protein by Health Canada.
Immunocal scientific studies have been published in many of the most trusted and prestigious medical journals. 
Immunocal is listed in the:

Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR): This official reference book sits in the office of virtually every doctor and pharmacist in America, as it lists all the substances a doctor can prescribe.
Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS): Immunocal is listed in this Canadian reference book.


Immunocal is recognized by some of the world’s most respected doctors and researchers:

Dr. James F. Balch, prominent authority on nutrition and best-selling author of “Prescription for Nutritional Healing” states that “It’s my opinion that everyone should be taking Immunocal. Today, there’s no better way to boost your immune system.”

Dr. Luc Montagnier, 2008 Nobel Prize Winner in Medicine.


Immunocal is used by a rapidly-growing number of top professional and amateur athletes (including Olympic Athletes) worldwide, to maintain their health and improve performance.
There are upwards of 100,000 articles published on the topic of glutathione. The best compilation of these can be found on PubMed, a service of the NIH (USA National Institute of Health).

By delivering this delicate protein to the cell, it enables the body to create glutathione and maximize immune system levels.  Other whey proteins are often manufactured using high heat (pasteurization) and harsh methods of mixing, resulting in a denatured and ineffective product.
What does undenatured mean?
Undenatured means that a protein is not damaged or significantly changed from the way it appears in nature. Immunocal works by providing important glutathione precursors to the cell.  It is critical that these precursors remain intact or undenatured during the manufacturing and mixing processes in order to enhance the immune system.  That is why we recommend that Immunocal not be heated or subject to harsh mixing in order to preserve it bioactivity.
Do other whey protein isolates work?
As a source of amino acids, whey protein has a superior nutritional advantage over other types of protein. All whey protein isolates are a good source of protein. However, there are many other variables that need to be considered in a whey's quality. Most importantly is the degree in which the protein resembles its original form in nature. This is easily altered in the harvesting, manufacturing, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control of the product. Other whey protein isolates have not been thoroughly tested in clinical trials done on human beings, so it's anybody's guess as to whether they work or not.
What does Immunocal do?
Immunocal is a natural source of the glutathione precursor cysteine for the maintenance of a strong immune system.
How does Immunocal work?
Immunocal supplies the rare building blocks (precursors) for your cells to make glutathione.
				Immunocal supplies all the essential amino acids required by your cells and tissues.
				Immunocal supplies other peptides (small proteins) critical for many aspects of your health.
What is glutathione?
It is a substance that is produced by your own cells that is fundamental to life. Glutathione plays many roles, the most important of which are:
				
It is your body's master antioxidant.
GSH plays a determinant role in the proper functioning of the immune system.


Why can't a person just eat glutathione?
Glutathione is broken down by digestion and very little if any can get from your mouth to your cell where it's needed. To raise glutathione effectively, you must give your cells the building blocks (precursors) to make glutathione yourself.
How have the benefits of Immunocal been proven? How do we know it works?
Immunocal has had research performed starting as far back as the late 1970's at McGill University (Canada's foremost Medical School). There continues to be much effort in publishing human clinical trials in respected peer-reviewed medical journals worldwide. These articles are easily available on-line.
What is a "peer-reviewed" journal?
"Peer-reviewed" means that an article is scrutinized and criticized for quality and validity by other doctors and scientists before it can be published. Articles that don't stand up to this scrutiny are rejected. Most submissions are initially rejected. This screens for misguided or inaccurate statements.
How many articles have been published about Immunocal?
This is a moving target that grows every year. As of summer 2012 there have been over 35 articles published.
What are the "PDR and "CPS"?
The American PDR (Physicians' Desk Reference) and the Canadian CPS (Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties) are published yearly and distributed to all the doctors and pharmacists in the country. It holds all the prescribing information for drugs, however, Immunocal is not a drug. It is one of the rare natural substances that hold a position in these publications.
There are other whey protein isolates that claim to have research as well. True?
When this "research" is actually examined, usually you will find:
				
That they are quoting work done by Dr. Bounous, Kongshavn, Droge or other prominent scientists done on Immunocal. This does not mean that their products work as well.
They are experiments done in a laboratory or on laboratory animals, not in human beings.


Who can NOT take Immunocal?
Anyone with a specific allergy to the components.
				This does NOT include lactose. Immunocal contains less than 1% lactose. It is usually tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals.
				Anyone taking immunosuppressant medication to avoid rejection of an organ transplant.
				Always ask your health professional before taking any supplements.
Can pregnant or lactating women take Immunocal?
No adverse effects have been reported. A health care practitioner should be consulted prior to use if the person is pregnant or has reason to believe she is, or if she is breastfeeding.
Can geriatric clients take Immunocal?
Yes, glutathione levels drop with age.
Are there side effects?
Immunocal is a natural source of protein classified as a Natural Health Product. Gastrointestinal bloating and cramps are possible if the product is not sufficiently rehydrated. Transient urticarial-like skin rash has been reported in rare individuals undergoing severe detoxification reaction. Skin rash abates when the intake is stopped or reduced.
Can you overdose on Immunocal?
There have been no reports of toxicity from overdosing on Immunocal. Glutathione is a tightly regulated intracellular constituent and is limited in its production by negative feedback inhibition of its own synthesis through the enzyme gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, thus greatly minimizing any possibility of overdose.

Are there liquids that CAN NOT be used to mix with Immunocal?
Avoid hot liquids and extremely acidic liquids.
Can I use a blender to mix Immunocal?
Power blenders should generally be avoided. Small, low-speed, hand-held plastic blenders are acceptable.
How long is Immunocal good for once it has been mixed?
As a general guideline, consume shortly after mixing, preferably within 30 minutes. It is best kept cool while waiting.
Can Immunocal be mixed with milk?
Immunocal can be mixed with milk.
				Immunocal Platinum can be mixed with milk but may taste salty or sour in milk.
When is the best time to take Immunocal?
Most people take Immunocal first thing in the morning or after your body has been fasting for a few hours. This will enhance protein absorption and amino acid utilization. If you are taking multiple pouches per day, these can be taken at separate times.
If I am taking several pouches of Immunocal per day, can I take them all at once?
Yes.
Does Immunocal contain any additives?  
The product is additive-free; the sole ingredient is whey protein isolate.
Does Immunocal contain any animal products?  
Immunocal is completely of dairy origin and does not contain any other animal derived materials.
Does Immunocal contain any Pesticides or Antibiotic?
Immunocal does not contain antibiotics or pesticide residues.
Is there any danger of "Mad Cow Disease" /Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)?
No. Because of concerns about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) the cattle are continuously surveyed for evidence of the disease.  Immunotec herds also fully participate in the Federal Mammalian Protein Feeding Ban.  Feeding the cows with proteins of ruminants is prohibited the United States. Immunocal is certified free of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
How should Immunocal be stored?
Immunocal should be stored in a cool dry place to maximize shelf-life and preserve integrity; we suggest temperatures of 70-90°F (21-32°C).
How much raw milk does it take to make Immunocal?
We need 300 liters (79.25 US gallons) of fresh, raw milk to produce 1 kilogram (2.2 lbs.) of Immunocal.  It is produced using a gentle process and low temperatures to preserve the biological activity of the proteins.
What is the difference between taking Immunocal as opposed to taking other antioxidants? 
Immunocal, as such, is not an antioxidant but provides the building blocks for the synthesis of glutathione, which is the principal intracellular antioxidant.
