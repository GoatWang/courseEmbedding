Newsboys with Special Guest Mandisa






			Welcomed by 106.9 The Light

			Friday, August 18

7:30 p.m. on Biltmore's South Terrace

			The Newsboys have defined contemporary Christian music for more than two decades. Moving fluidly between rock and pop, worship and dance, their live shows exhibit a kind of energy that, if it could be bottled, would power entire cities. Along the way, they’ve sold more than 8 million albums and amassed eight Gold® certifications, 33 #1 hits, four Grammy® nominations, two American Music Award nominations, and multiple Dove Awards. Additionally, their chart-topping, Platinum®-certified single, “God’s Not Dead,” inspired the 2014 hit film of the same name.

			With a strong, supple voice that is equally commanding on an up-tempo anthem or a tender ballad, contemporary Christian singer and songwriter Mandisa has developed a devoted legion of fans who appreciate not only her vocal gift but the heart that fuels her music. Following a top-ten finish on American Idol, Mandisa released her debut album True Beauty in 2007, earning the first of three Grammy® nominations. Her Grammy-winning fourth album Overcomer includes intensely personal singles including “Press On,” “Face to Face,” and What Scars Are For.” Her latest album Out of the Dark will be released in May 2017.

Goo Goo Dolls: Long Way Home Summer Tour 2017 with special guest Phillip Phillips






			Saturday, August 26

7:30 p.m. on Biltmore's South Terrace

			The Goo Goo Dolls have become one of the most globally respected and influential forces in popular music history, selling more than 10 million albums since 1986. In addition to a string of #1 and Top 10 singles including “Name,” “Slide,” and “Let Love In,” their hit “Iris,” from the City Of Angels soundtrack, was #1 on the Billboard charts for 17 consecutive weeks. During their career, the four-time Grammy nominees have toured the globe countless times and recorded and released 11 studio albums. Their newest EP is You Should Be Happy.

			Since releasing his five-times-platinum debut single “Home” in 2012, Phillip Phillips has put out two chart-topping albums and taken his earthy but expansive brand of guitar-fueled rock to stages across the globe. Featuring his rich, soulful vocals and ruggedly warm sensibilities, Phillips’ first album The World from the Side of the Moon went platinum soon after its debut. Two years later, his second album Behind the Light offered up the lead single “Raging Fire,” a major radio hit that revealed his bold twist on anthemic folk-rock.

REO Speedwagon






			Thursday, August 24

7:30 p.m. on Biltmore's South Terrace

			Formed in 1967, signed in 1971, and fronted by iconic vocalist Kevin Cronin since 1972, REO Speedwagon’s unrelenting drive, as well as non-stop touring and recording, jump-started the burgeoning rock movement in the Midwest. Hit albums and freeform FM radio staples followed, setting the stage for the release of the band’s explosive Hi Infidelity in 1980, which contained massive hit singles “Keep On Loving You” and “Take It On the Run,” and spent 15 weeks in the #1 slot. To date, REO Speedwagon has sold 40 million albums around the globe, with Hi Infidelity approaching 10-times platinum status in the U.S.

			Nearly five decades since forming, Cronin and bandmates Bruce Hall (bass), Neal Doughty (keyboards), Dave Amato (guitar) and Bryan Hitt (drums) are still electrifying audiences worldwide, with concerts featuring their timeless #1 singles “Keep on Loving You” and “Can’t Fight This Feeling,” along with fan-favorites including, “Take It on the Run,” “Time for Me to Fly,” “Roll With the Changes,” “Ridin’ The Storm Out,” and more.

About Biltmore
Biltmore Wealth Management, LLC, was founded in order to help our clients protect and simplify their financial lives.  Our purpose is to support our clients and their families by offering guidance that will create personal fulfillment and financial security.
The Biltmore Wealth Management advantage is based in these five benefits:
Accountability and Attention – As an independent Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) we are entrusted with a fiduciary responsibility to each of our clients – this is to act solely in their best interests.  By design, we serve far fewer clients than many other firms which lets us focus on what matters – you.
Advisor Owned Firm – Biltmore Wealth Management is a 100% advisor owned firm; allowing us to provide clear, unbiased information to meet clients’ objectives and allowing the client direct access to the firm’s decision makers.
Greater Independence – Since we are not part of a brokerage firm with in-house products and services to sell, we are able to offer a significant array of tools and services to clients that put them on a financial pathway which will best meet their needs.
Our Interests Aligned With Yours – Our compensation is based on a percentage of assets under management (fee-only), so our success is directly linked to that of our clients.
Experience and Qualifications – Backed by a combined 38 years of industry experience, the professionals at Biltmore Wealth Management each brings a unique expertise to every client relationship.
We welcome you to contact our office to learn more about who we are and schedule a consultation to discover how we can partner with you and your family for long-term success.
