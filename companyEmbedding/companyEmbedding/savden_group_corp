	Notes
	to the Condensed Financial Statements






	November
	30, 2016






	(Unaudited)





	 





	NOTE
	1 -

	 

	ORGANIZATION, CHANGE IN CONTROL AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS





	 




	Savden
	Group Corp. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or the “Registrant”)
	was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 2, 2014 and our principal executive offices are located at Room 1005, 10th
	Floor, Tower A, New Mandarin Plaza, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong

	.

	The Company was formed

	to
	engage in the business of providing a business planning service to small and medium-sized companies.





	 




	The
	Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on
	June 19, 2015, which was declared effective on October 22, 2015. In April 2016, a change of control occurred as reported in the
	Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 11, 2016. In May 2016, new management of the Company abandoned the Company’s previous
	business plan and determined to seek a possible business combination. The current business purpose of the Company is to seek the
	acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company.




	 




	On
	May 16, 2016, DONG Yingzhi (“Purchaser” or “DONG”) acquired 100% of the equity ownership of Sino Expertise
	Limited (“SEL”) from a third party (“Seller”). Seller had purchased 100% of the ownership of SEL from
	Kimberly Leung (“Leung”) on May 12, 2016. DONG used his personal funds for the purchase. Leung had caused the 500,000,000
	shares (on a post-split basis) of the Company, that she acquired from Denis Savinskii on April 20, 2016, to be registered in the
	name of SEL. As a result of the sale of 100% of the equity ownership of SEL to Purchaser, Purchaser may be deemed to be the beneficial
	owner of the 500,000,000 shares (on a post-split basis) (“Shares”) of the Company held by SEL, which constitutes approximately
	79.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company effected a forward split of
	100:1 of its shares that was effective on August 26, 2016.




	 




	As
	a result of the change in control and upon the request of DONG, CHAN Wai Lun, the sole officer and director of the Company, resigned
	from his positions as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and also resigned from his position as the sole
	director of the Company effective at 12:00 AM (China time) on September 1, 2016. In his capacity as a director, Mr. CHAN elected
	DONG to the Board of Directors prior to the effective time of his resignation and elected DONG as the Company’s President
	and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer to take effect immediately following his resignation
	as an officer of the Company.




	 




	The
	Company is currently considered to be a “blank check” company. The SEC defines those companies as “any development
	stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
	amended (the “Exchange Act”), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business
	plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also
	qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.  Many
	states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their
	respective jurisdictions. Management has undertaken steps to have the Company’s common stock traded on the OTC market. The
	market is illiquid, there has been no trading of any significance and there can be no assurance that a trading market of any significance
	will develop or that there will be any depth to any such market that may develop. Management does not intend to undertake any
	significant efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities until we have successfully concluded a business combination.
	The Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act under Section 15(d) as a result of its registration
	statement on Form S-1 being declared effective by the SEC, and intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the
	Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.




	 




	The
	accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
	and the Company’s fiscal year end is May 31.

	NOTE
	2 -

	 

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 






	Basis
	of Presentation






	 





	The
	Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America (“GAAP”). The accompanying interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles for interim financial information in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
	they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
	statements. While management of the Company believes that the disclosures presented herein are adequate and not misleading, these
	interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for
	the year ended May 31, 2016. 




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts
	of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.




	 





	Cash
	and cash equivalents





	 




	The
	Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.




	 




	The
	Company’s bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to USD$65,000 in Hong Kong insured institutions.
	At May 31, 2016 the Company’s bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.




	 





	Earnings
	per Share





	 




	The
	Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45 “Earnings per Share”, which requires presentation
	of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
	by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during
	the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the
	period.  Dilutive earnings (loss) per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company
	has no potential dilutive instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are equal.




	 





	Commitments
	and Contingencies






	 





	The
	Company follows ASC 450-20, “Loss Contingencies,” to report accounting for contingencies.  Liabilities for loss
	contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable
	that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.  There were no commitments
	or contingencies at November 30, 2016 and May 31, 2016.




	 











	 



	6



	 







	 





	 





	Prepaid
	Expenses





	 




	Prepaid
	expenses are cash paid amounts that represent costs incurred from which a service or benefit is expected to be derived in the
	future. The future write-off period of the incurred cost will normally be determined by the period of benefit covered by the prepayment.
	When the period arrives to which a prepaid cost relates the costs will be treated as a period cost for the period in question.
	Normally such prepaid costs will be amortized based on the elapse of time.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	The
	Company will recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, “Revenue Recognition”
	(“ASC-605”). ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability
	is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management’s judgments regarding the fixed nature of
	the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to
	customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.
	The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the
	Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.




	 





	Fair
	value of financial instruments





	 




	The
	Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements” (“ASC 820”)
	for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of non-financial items
	that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements.  ASC 820 also establishes a framework for
	measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.   




	 




	Fair
	value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
	between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
	required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it
	would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 




	 




	ASC
	820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
	unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.
	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
	1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The
	three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.






	 






	 




	●




	Level
	2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
	that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
	instruments.






	 






	 




	●




	Level
	3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.






	 




	There
	were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as
	of November 30, 2016.

	Stock-based
	compensation





	 




	The
	Company recognizes stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718 “Stock Compensation,” which requires
	the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including
	employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to an Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the estimated fair values.




	 





	Recently
	Issued Accounting Principles





	 




	Revenue
	recognition




	 




	In
	May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (“ASU
	2014-09”). This new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific
	guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core
	principle is that a company should recognize revenue to correlate with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
	in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
	In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, while allowing a company to adopt the new
	revenue standard early but not before the original effective date. As such, the updated standard will be effective for the Company
	in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. The Company has evaluated the effect on
	the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and concluded that the adoption of this ASU is not
	expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.




	 




	Liabilities




	 




	In
	February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis”.
	The new consolidation standard changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships
	and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable
	interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE.
	The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2015. Early adoption is allowed, including early adoption in an interim period. A reporting entity may apply a modified retrospective
	approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or may apply
	the amendments retrospectively. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated
	financial statements.




	 




	Financial
	Instruments




	 




	In
	January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
	of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU 2016-01”). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition,
	measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
	within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective
	for us on September 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on the Company’s
	consolidated financial statements.




	 




	Leases




	 




	In
	February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-2”), which provides guidance
	on lease amendments to the FASB Accounting Standard Codification. This ASU will be effective for us beginning in May 1, 2019.
	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-2 on the Company’s consolidated
	financial statements.




	 




	Stock-based
	Compensation




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
	Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”). ASU 2016-09 changes how companies account for certain aspects of stock-based
	awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well
	as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, and earlier adoption
	is permitted. We are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related
	disclosures.

	Financial
	Instruments - Credit Losses




	 




	In
	June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)” (“ASU 2016-13”).
	The amendments in this Update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be
	presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The amendments broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing
	its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The use of forecasted information incorporates
	more timely information in the estimate of expected credit loss, which will be more decision useful to users of the financial
	statements. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods
	within those fiscal years. Early adoption is allowed as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
	periods within those fiscal years. The Company is still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on the Company’s
	consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.




	 




	Except
	for the ASUs above, in the period from May 31, 2016 to November 30, 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-01 through ASU 2016-13,
	which are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.




	 






	NOTE
	3 – GOING CONCERN






	 




	The
	Company’s financial statements as of November 30, 2016 have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles
	in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of
	liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss of $63,906 and cash used in operating
	activities of $6,306 for the six months ended at November 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability
	of the Company to continue as a going concern.




	 




	In
	order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s
	plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient
	to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances
	that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
	related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
	should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




	 






	NOTE
	4 – PREPAID EXPENSES






	 




	The
	prepaid expense was the annual fee payment for the OTC Market. The amount was $3,333 and $8,333 as of November 30, 2016 and May
	31, 2016, respectively.




	 






	NOTE
	5 – RELATED PARTIES TRANSACTION






	 




	In
	support of the Company’s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that
	the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing.
	There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors or shareholders. Amounts represent advances
	or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by
	a promissory note.  




	 




	As
	of November 30 2016, and May 31, 2016, the amount due to shareholder was $6,306 and zero, respectively. The amount due to shareholder
	is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.

	NOTE
	6 – EQUITY






	 




	On
	June 6, 2015, 5,000,000 (500,000,000 on a post-split basis) common shares at a price of $0.001 per share for total net proceeds
	of $5,000 were issued to the Company’s sole officer and director.




	 




	During
	the period from January 2015 to April 2016, the Company issued 1,290,000 (129,000,000) shares at a price of $0.02 for total proceeds
	of $25,800.




	 




	On
	May 20, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved resolutions to: (i) increase the authorized number of shares of common
	stock from 75,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock to 1,000,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock (“Increase
	in Authorized”), and (ii) effect a 100:1 forward split of the Company’s authorized, issued and outstanding shares of
	common stock at the later of such time as the directors should determine to make it effective or one day after the Amendment to
	increase the number of the Company’s authorized shares is filed with the Nevada Secretary of State (“Forward Stock Split”).
	The Increase in Authorized and the Forward Stock Split shall be sometimes referred to collectively as the “Amendments”.
	On that same date, shareholders of the Company holding 79% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock signed
	consent resolutions approving the Amendments.




	 




	On
	June 24, 2016, the Company filed an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State
	to increase the authorized shares of the Company’s common stock. On June 24, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with
	the Nevada Secretary of State to provide notice of the 100:1 forward split of the Company’s common stock. The Forward Stock
	Split became effective on August 10, 2016. As a result of the Forward Stock Split, the number of the Company’s issued and outstanding
	shares of common stock was increased from 6,290,000 to 629,000,000.




	 






	NOTE
	7 – INCOME TAX






	 




	The
	Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.”
	Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
	(ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s
	financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
	to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.




	 




	The
	effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period
	that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the
	weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
	will not be realized.




	 




	ASC
	Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements
	and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a
	tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
	interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. There are no material uncertain tax positions
	for any of the reporting periods presented.




	 




	As
	of November 30, 2016, the Company in the United States had $63,906 in net operating loss carry forwards available
	to offset future taxable income. Federal net operating losses can generally be carried forward twenty years. The Company believes
	that it is more likely than not that these net accumulated operating losses will not be utilized in the future. Therefore, the
	Company has provided full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets arising from the losses at US. Accordingly, the Company
	has no net deferred tax assets under the US entity.

	Forward
	Looking Statement Notice






	 





	Certain
	statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private
	Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in regard to the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements
	involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of
	SavDen Group Corp. to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
	forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous
	risks and uncertainties. The Company’s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving its ability to identify
	a target candidate, to negotiate the terms of the acquisition of the target candidate and then to consummate the acquisition.
	Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and
	market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which
	are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements
	are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements
	included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking
	statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any
	other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.




	 





	Description
	of Business






	 





	The
	Company intends to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived
	advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next twelve months and beyond such time
	will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings.
	The Company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business or industry and, thus, may acquire
	any type of business. Although management has not restricted the geographical location of the target companies to China, management
	believes that it is probable that the targets evaluated will be based in China or Asia.




	 




	The
	Company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow.  During the next twelve months
	we anticipate incurring costs related to:




	 






	(i)




	filing
	periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and






	 






	(ii)




	investigating,
	analyzing and consummating an acquisition.






	 




	We
	believe we will be able to meet these costs through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary,
	to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.  There are no assurances that
	the Company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, our ability to continue as a going concern
	is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations
	and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  Our ability to continue as a
	going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with
	such company. Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or
	related party advances; however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.




	 











	 



	11



	 







	 





	 




	The
	Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional
	funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business
	which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business
	combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which
	desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense
	and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.




	 




	Any
	target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth,
	including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent
	in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we
	may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management
	will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly
	ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business
	combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which
	is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve
	a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it
	will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.




	 




	The
	Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky.  Through information
	obtained from industry publications and professionals, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived
	benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include,
	among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity
	for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits
	to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance
	of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development,
	all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and
	complex.  We do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits
	of potential target businesses.




	 





	Results
	of Operations





	 




	We
	have not generated any revenue to date and have incurred recurring losses since inception. It is unlikely the Company will have
	any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance.  Our
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
	relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be
	unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We
	expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. It is management’s assertion
	that these circumstances may hinder the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company’s plan of operation
	for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates.

	The
	Company has nominal assets and has generated no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital
	investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a
	private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and
	capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able
	to implement its plan of operations.




	 





	Cash
	Flows from Operating Activities





	 




	We
	have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the six months ended November 30, 2016, net cash flows
	used in operating activities were $6,306 consisting primarily of a net loss of $26,539 and increase of accrued expenses of
	$15,233. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $1,687 for the six months ended November 30, 2015 consisting of
	a net loss of $4,442 and increase of other payable of 2,755.




	 





	Cash
	Flows from Investing Activities





	 




	We
	neither generated, nor used, funds in investing activities during the six months ended November 30, 2016.

	During
	the six months ended November 30, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $1,700, which was contributed solely by the
	purchase of fixed assets.




	 





	Cash
	Flows from Financing Activities





	 




	We
	have financed our operations primarily from either advances from shareholders or the issuance of equity instruments. For the
	six months November 30, 2016 net cash provided by financing activities was $6,306 for the amount due to shareholder. For the
	six months November 30, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $8,500 from proceeds from the issuance of common
	stock.  




	 





	Going
	Concern Consideration





	 




	There
	is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern unless we are able to effect our business plan and raise
	funds necessary to continue operations. The financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a
	going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary
	course of business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern, and the financial statements
	do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements






	 





	As
	of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
	likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
	results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.




	 






	Contractual
	Obligations






	 




	As
	a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this
	information. 




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates






	 





	We
	prepare our condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply
	judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes
	to be important at the time the condensed financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies
	and how they are applied and disclosed in our condensed financial statements.




	 




	While
	we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our condensed
	financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.

	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	 




	Under
	the supervision and with the participation of our then principal executive officer and principal financial officer, CHAN Wai Lun,
	we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)
	promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of May 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation, Mr. CHAN Wai
	Lun concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective at such time to ensure that information required to
	be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized and reported
	within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Our principal executive officer
	and principal financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls, which are designed to ensure that information required
	to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
	were inappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	Based
	on Mr. Chan’s assessment, he concluded that there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial
	reporting as of May 31, 2016 based on the material weaknesses described below:




	 






	 




	●




	Because
	the Company consists of one person who acts as the sole officer and director of the Company, there are limited controls over
	information processing.






	 






	 




	●




	There
	is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives as management is composed of only one person. In
	order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently,
	it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter
	after the Company completes a reverse merger or business combination to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty
	is feasible.






	 






	 




	●




	The
	Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the Board oversight role
	within the financial reporting process.






	 






	 




	●




	There
	is a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions.






	 




	The
	Company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial
	statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions
	and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations
	of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration
	of certain transactions.




	 




	As
	a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
	as of May 31, 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
	reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements
	will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
	in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness; yet important enough to merit attention
	by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting.




	 




	In
	order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness, we have engaged an outside accounting consultant with significant experience
	in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements
	to ensure that these financial statements are prepared in conformity to U.S. GAAP. Management believes that this will lessen the
	possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will occur and will increase the possibility
	that such a misstatement will be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of
	this action and make any changes that our management deems appropriate.




	 




	We
	plan to rectify these deficiencies upon consummation of a business combination with an operating company when we expect to have
	sufficient resources so that a majority of the Board will consist of independent Board members and the number of personnel performing
	key functions in the Company can be increased so that duties can be better segregated. There can be no assurance that we will
	have sufficient resources to accomplish these goals.

	Evaluation
	of Internal Controls and Procedures






	 




	Management
	is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
	under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s
	principal executive, principal operating and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
	by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
	of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
	of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;
	(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only
	in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
	or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
	on the financial statements.




	 




	Because
	of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
	of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
	in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	 



	Our management assessed the
	effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at May 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the
	criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated
	Framework. Based on that assessment under those criteria, management concluded that, as of May 31, 2016, the Company’s internal
	control over financial reporting was not effective.


	 


	Subsequent to the change in control that occurred in May 2016, our sole officer and director considered our
	disclosure controls and procedures, and concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures for the fiscal year
	ended May 31, 2016 were ineffective.


	 



	Mr.
	DONG Yingzhi, our sole officer and director, considered our internal controls and procedures, in connection with this Report on
	Form 10-Q, and concluded that we continue to have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting because
	we do not have an independent Board of Directors or audit committee or adequate segregation of duties since there is a single
	officer and director. Further, we have no independent body to oversee our internal control over financial reporting. The lack
	of segregation of duties is due to the limited nature and resources of the Company. 




	 




	We
	plan to rectify these deficiencies upon consummation of a business combination with an operating company when we expect to have
	sufficient resources so that a majority of the Board will consist of independent Board members and the number of personnel performing
	key functions in the Company can be increased so that duties can be better segregated. There can be no assurance that we will
	have sufficient resources to accomplish these goals.




	 




	This
	Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
	financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant
	to the exemption provided to issuers that are not “large accelerated filers” nor “accelerated filers” under
	the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the
full $100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any
proceeds from the offering.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Denis Savinskii, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Mr. Savinskii’s verbal agreement to provide
us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr.
Savinskii will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of
this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by
Mr. Savinskii. Mr. Savinskii will be repaid from revenues of operations if and
when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


As to the present date, there are many companies with similar services. There
are the few barriers of entry in the business and level of competition is
extremely high. We intend to focus our forces on the specific needs related to
our potential clients. We consider high usability of service as an advantage
over our competitors on the market. The features are planned to be the
following:

. Visual representation of the information.

. Guided assistance in a form of pop-up hints throughout every step of making a
  business plan.

. Showing examples of what type of information has to be typed in every field
  (such as figures, description and any other sort of data).

. “Step-by-step” video tutorials.
