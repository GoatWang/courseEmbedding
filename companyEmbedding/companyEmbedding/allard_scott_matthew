If you see a knee brace on another site that is priced lower than The Brace Shop we will match the price PLUS a special discount on future orders. WE WILL NOT BE UNDERSOLD! In the Knee Brace Category below, we have divided this section with all of the knee braces that we offer based on the type or style of knee brace. The Sports Knee Brace category lists all the off the shelf rigid framed knee braces. These knee braces are made of aluminum alloy, carbon fiber, magnesium or other exotic materials that provide strength and stability for maximum support. These knee supports offer maximum knee protection for ACL, PCL, meniscus and collateral ligament injuries. If your doctor recommended a brace for osteo-arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, the "unloader" arthritis knee brace category lists all the knee braces that are designed to "off load" or take pressure of a knee joint that is bone on bone. A great example of a popular sports arthritis knee brace is the NEW Fusion OA Plus Unloader Knee Brace. For athletes and patients that do not require a rigid framed brace, The Brace Shop has a huge selection of fabric hinged knee braces. These knee braces are made of elastic, neoprene or other materials such as lycra nylon combinations (drytex, airmesh). Click on the elastic category if you are looking for knee sleeves or knee supports that do not have hinges. Many of these braces will contain metal or aluminum stays on the sides of the brace. These are designed to maintain the integrity of the knee brace and prevent rollup. Other categories in this section include neoprene knee braces (great for water and winter sports), post-op knee braces, knee bands, sports knee pads and knee braces that contain magnets. We have a special Pediatric Knee Brace category so you can locate knee braces designed for the little knee injuries. Whichever knee brace you choose, you can be sure that The Brace Shop offers the best selection, the best prices, the best service and the fastest shipping for all your orthopedic needs. Shop where the Pro's Go!
