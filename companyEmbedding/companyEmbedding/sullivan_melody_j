About
Melody J. Sullivan founded the first woman-owned CPA firm in Franklin, Tennessee’s Historic Downtown business district in July of 1986 after working as a staff accountant for one of Nashville’s most respected business owners and CPA firms, and serving as comptroller for a local food service company.
Focusing her energies and interest on the financial goals of her clients coupled with the integration of cutting edge accounting and tax strategies resulted in the firm’s immediate success. Today, SmileyCPAs is one of Middle Tennessee’s most respected CPA firms, serving dozens of Corporations and over 1,500 tax clients.
In November 2005, SmileyCPAs moved to the Offices Reserve at Cross Creek on Murfreesboro Road near I-65. “With more and more of our clients located outside the Franklin area, we felt it was time to go to a more central location that provided easy interstate access. This building fits the bill perfectly.”
If you are searching for a CPA firm, please consider SmileyCPAs. We will listen to you, dedicate the resources necessary to provide comprehensive financial information and advice, and provide creative tax planning tactics and counsel. We want to be a part of your future financial success.
