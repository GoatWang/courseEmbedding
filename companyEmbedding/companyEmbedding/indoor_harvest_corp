HOUSTON, March 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Indoor Harvest, Corp. (OTC Pink: INQD), through its brand name Indoor Harvest™, is a design build contractor, developer, marketer and direct-seller of commercial grade aeroponic and hydroponic fixtures and supporting systems for use in urban Controlled Environment Agriculture and Building Integrated Agriculture. The Company is pleased to announce that it will be introducing its recently developed low cost vertical farming platform at Indoor Ag-Con next week in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Indoor Harvest's CEO and founder Chad Sykes commented, "We believe that there is a growing demand for affordable vertical farming systems, but most current offerings are still out of the price range of most entrants. We looked at the current state of the industry and developed what we believe is the most cost effective platform based on current technology available."
The Company's new vertical farming platform is designed to reduce costs by being engineered to utilize the standardized "Strut" channel framing system. Strut channel is the industry standard when it comes to the construction of framing systems to support mechanical systems around the world. As an addition to our platform, we have developed a frame that will support either an aeroponic system or a hydroponic system and incorporates the Illumitex® brand Eclipse Series LED horticulture lighting system right out of the box. The Company has also engineered the related brackets and hardware to support the lighting system drivers and associated plumbing. 
Mr. Sykes added, "By making our vertical farming platform compatible with Strut framing systems and a proven popular LED lighting system, we have created a platform that can be fully customized, is affordable to even the smallest operator and can reduce the cost associated with installation. With prices expected to come in around $90 a square foot for a complete shallow raft system, including LED's, I believe we've developed the lowest cost system on the market while maintaining commercial grade engineering. We designed this platform specifically for the smaller commercial vertical farming operator."
Vertical farming is a new industry that has only just recently begun to gain traction. Over the last three years, we have seen a significant increase in the number of small scale vertical farms being built to grow gourmet leafy greens, herbs and micro-greens for niche produce markets. It is our intention to provide affordable, simple to install systems to these small growers entering this new industry. 
To date, vertical farming has mostly been a do-it-yourself business. Vertical farming industry entrants have had to design their own systems due to a lack of affordable platforms. This more often than not has resulted in higher R&D expenditures as early pioneers have had to design and re-design their systems as they go. The trend has been to adapt existing industrial shelving systems such as tear drop and cantilever style systems for use in vertical farming. This approach is costly because modifications must be made to these systems to adapt them for use in vertical farming. These modifications dramatically increase installation labor. Our system has been pre-engineered specifically for vertical farming and designed to reduce labor costs associated with installation.
We will begin offering our new vertical farming platform in the Second Quarter of 2015. We will be displaying our vertical farming platform at the upcoming Indoor Ag-Con March 31 through April 1, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada. For more information on Indoor Ag-Con please visit http://www.indoor.ag.
We currently plan on filing on March 31, 2015 our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Consistent with the SEC's April 2013 guidance on using social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter to make corporate disclosures and announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD, Indoor Harvest is alerting investors and other members of the general public that Indoor Harvest will provide weekly updates on operations and progress through its social media on Facebook and Twitter. Investors, potential investors and individuals interested in our company are encouraged to keep informed by following us on Twitter or Facebook.

Henry Gordon-Smith @agri_tect

Let's move past the hype of #verticalfarming and towards established best practices that help the industry mature.

Indoor Harvest Corp Moves Towards Cannabis Economic Pilot

Sep 29, 2015, 08:30 ET
		  		  							
						 from   Indoor Harvest Corp 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOUSTON, Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Indoor Harvest Corp (OTCQB: INQD), ("Indoor Harvest" or the "Company"), is a mechanical design build contractor, developer, marketer and direct-seller of commercial grade aeroponic and hydroponic vertical farming fixtures and supporting systems for use in urban Controlled Environment Agriculture and Building Integrated Agriculture. The Company is pleased to announce the initial results of the technical pilot for our aeroponic system and the next steps in the ongoing Cannabis Production Pilot Project (the "Pilot Project") with Tweed, the leading producer of medical marijuana in Canada.
On December 18, 2014, Indoor Harvest entered into the Pilot Project Agreement with Tweed (through its parent company, Canopy Growth Corporation, formerly Tweed Marijuana Inc.). The Pilot Project tested the production of cannabis using Indoor Harvest's high-pressure aeroponic system and recorded growth rate, phytocannabinoid production, water usage, fertilizer usage and labor required to operate the aeroponic system. As part of the agreement, Tweed and Indoor Harvest will share any intellectual property resulting from the Pilot Project, and Tweed was given options on design-build services as well as certain manufacturing rights from Indoor Harvest. 
The initial aeroponic Pilot Project took place between March and August 2015. A sativa dominant strain, Ghost Train Haze, was selected and 8 plants were grown in a 4' X 8' X 2' system using a "Screen of Green" cultivation method, in which plants are cropped and trained to produce a higher yield from a single plant. The Company's patent pending aeroponic system showed a significant increase in growth rate during the vegetative stage, as compared to more traditional production methods such as drip irrigation using coco.
Fertilizer usage was reduced by as much as 68% with the system averaging 8 gallons a day under high pressure sodium and 9 gallons a day under LED, operating drain to waste. As tuning of the system progressed, average water use was reduced to approximately 5 gallons per day drain to waste. The Company believes that through additional tuning, more water savings for drain to waste and under recirculated operation can be achieved, and water use could be reduced by as much as 98% overall. Under 2,000 watts of high-pressure sodium lighting, the aeroponic system produced 3.1 pounds of dried flowers and under 1,040 watts of LED lighting produced 2.8 pounds of dried flowers in its initial test. The Company believes that with additional tuning, yield can be increased. 
Mr. Chad Sykes, Chief Executive Officer of Indoor Harvest, stated "According to MJCharts.com, Ghost Train Haze sells at a nationwide average of approximately $15.70 per gram in the United States. Under LED lighting, in a system that has not been fully tuned, that would be over $19,000 worth of what is considered in the industry as a premium grade medical product in one harvest, produced on our $8,500 system that can be used by anyone who has the legal right to use our system to grow the product." 
"We wouldn't have gotten these great results if not for the extremely talented R&D team and growers at Tweed. Working together, we have already made a few fascinating discoveries along the way, and we will be continuing to work together to turn these discoveries into what we hope ultimately will be patentable claims," further stated Mr. Sykes. 
On September 28, 2015, the Company and Tweed mutually agreed to extend collaborative research and development for an additional two years. The Company is now in the process of providing specifications and costs to build out 1,700 sq.ft. of aeroponic production space at the Tweed facility in Smiths Falls for the purpose of an economic pilot. As part of the design build process, the Company will be incorporating prototype testing of our advanced racking system with integrated proprietary HVAC and LED lighting systems that incorporate the Company's patent pending aeroponic process. 
The aeroponic system being tested eliminates mediums and their associated contaminates, provides the ability to feed and water plants with unmatched precision, and incorporates highly efficient HVAC and LED lighting systems. Based upon our preliminary engineering estimates, we believe that this combined system could potentially yield savings of up to 80% for medical cannabis producers currently utilizing more traditional hydroponic cultivation methods such as drip irrigation or flood and drain. Our goal is to create a platform that produces the finest medical cannabis, using the least amount of resources, while reducing the impact on our environment. This is why the Company believes that this system will prove to be the future of indoor farming of medical cannabis and indeed of indoor farming of all kinds of cultivars such as microgreens, leafy greens and herbs.
Consistent with the SEC's April 2013 guidance on using social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter to make corporate disclosures and announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD, Indoor Harvest is alerting investors and other members of the general public that Indoor Harvest will provide weekly updates on operations and progress through its social media on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Investors, potential investors and individuals interested in our company are encouraged to keep informed by following us on Twitter, YouTube or Facebook.

Our Flagship Modular High Pressure Aeroponic System


The heart of our current system, The Indoor Harvest® Modular Aeroponic Platform is a patent-pending, fixture-based design for use in creating the mechanical infrastructure for any form of building-integrated agricultural facility.

The system comprises of seven primary fixture components that consist of an Aeroponic Growth Tray, Aeroponic Growth Lid, Aeroponic Spray Manifold, Aeroponic Pressure Manifold, Nutrient Delivery System, Water Reclamation and Recirculation System, and Lift Station. Each of these individual modular fixtures are combined to create custom configurations suitable for any form of indoor growing environment.
Initially designed for the production of leafy greens, micro-greens, fruiting plants and herbs, our products and systems can also be easily adapted for a variety of other uses, such as horticultural research, medicinal plant production, plant cloning and hardwood propagation.








Benefits


· Up to a 95% reduction in water usage.
· Up to a 70% reduction in fertilizers.
· Accelerated growth rate.




· Increased biomass.
· Increased photochemical content.
· Sterile production.(by eliminating the need for growth mediums & substrates)

















Vertical Farm Racking System


The Indoor Harvest® Vertical Farm Racking System is a modular framing system engineered specifically for vertical farming.

Our framing system is designed to work with any standard 1 5/8” size strut channel. This makes the system universally simple to install and/or to incorporate into existing mechanical systems. The design incorporates adjustments to allow for precise leveling of the growing platform, no matter how uneven the grow room floor may be.
Our system is pre-engineered for “plug and play” installation of Illumitex® brand ES-1 and ES-2 LED fixtures* without the need for any custom modifications or electrical fabrication*. Likewise, our framing system is designed to work with any style of standard 4' X 8' hydroponic tray or shelf size.
Most importantly, our system is designed specifically for easy assembly of vertical (multi-tier) installations, thus greatly increasing potential crop yield per square foot.
*Since 2005, Illumitex® has been an industry leader in Advanced LED engineering and design for Horticultural, Industrial and Architectural applications.









Benefits


· Integrated LED lighting solution.
· Open slot face.




· Plug and play.
· Reduced installation cost.

Houston, San Antonio Medical Cannabis Companies Plan New Joint Venture




Austin - San Antonio
Land


Austin - San Antonio
Land


January 04, 2017



			Kyle Hagerty, Bisnow Houston
		









With a new law on their side, a JV between San Antonio-based cannabis cultivation experts, Vermont-based researchers and a Houston-based engineering firm are putting Texas at the forefront of biomedical cannabidiol research.

Houston-based Indoor Harvest Corp, a design-build vertical farming engineering firm, and Alamo CBD, a San Antonio-based cannabidiol (CBD) production company, are in talks to combine the companies and spin off Indoor Harvest's vertical farming operations. Alamo has signed an agreement with Delaware-based Vyripharm Enterprises to form a JV for pharmaceutical cannabinoids research.
The goal: Cancer treatments.
Under the proposed joint venture, Alamo will supply pure medical cannabis oil/product to Vyripharm to provide specific chemical profiles needed for Vyripharm’s research and patient treatments. Alamo will use Indoor Harvest’s patent pending bio-manufacturing platform for cultivation. Alamo's business plan is to use 10 acres, with water rights, near La Vernia, TX, to construct an 18k SF cannabidiol pharmaceutical production facility. 
The operation won't produce the recreational THC-heavy "high"-inducing form of cannabis. High levels of CBD, not THC, is the goal here. Much is still to be learned about CBD, but Vyripharm’s director of scientific public relations Dr. Elias Jackson said, “Early studies have shown a positive impact on certain resistant forms of cancer ... Based on the strength of these early studies, we believe that medical cannabis will play a vital role in the treatment regimen addressing a range of cancers, and that Texas and the Texas Medical Center could become a focal point for this important research.”

How is this cannabis-related business happening in Texas, legally speaking? The Texas Compassionate Use Act, which went into effect June 1, 2015, requires the DPS to license at least three dispensing organizations by Sept. 1, 2017. With state-of-the-art cultivation techniques, high-tech vertical farming, and clinical research and testing, the Alamo/Indoor Harvest joint venture aims to be one of those three.
Cannabis has been used in cancer treatment for thousands of years, but only recently have scientists begun to understand its subtle effects. Pre-clinical research (including both cell culture and animal models) with CBD has had a range of effects that may be therapeutically useful, including anti-seizure, antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-tumor, anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety properties. More rigorous clinical studies are still needed to evaluate clinical potential for specific conditions. That's where the new JV comes in. 
Alamo/Indoor Harvest's operation seeks to solve major problems in clinical research: supply and consistency. Medical science is rigorous and precise, and research surrounding CBD is too often compromised by inconsistent strains, inconsistent quality and an overall lack of supply. If the new operation gets off the ground (literally; it grows aeroponically, see above), its effect on biomedical research could be profound, offering researchers the control to achieve a much more professional level of reputable clinical research.

Texas Medical Center

To that end, Vyripharm has entered into sponsored research agreements for its core platforms with the University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston – Institute of Molecular Medicine Sponsored Research and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. There is also an agreement with the National Institute of Drug Abuse and pending agreements with Baylor College of Medicine and the VA Hospital in Houston. 
Alamo plans to file an application with the DEA and register to become an authorized producer of medical cannabis and medical cannabis extracts for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials across the US.

The medical industry's excitement about the potential of CBD is tempered by the national regulatory environment. To date, 23 states and DC have passed laws allowing cannabis to be used for a variety of medical conditions. Fifteen additional states have enacted laws (such as the Texas Compassionate Use Act) intended to allow access to CBD oil and high-CBD strains of marijuana.
But despite proven medical benefits and its potential given further research, the DEA still classifies cannabis as a Schedule 1 Narcotic, as dangerous as heroin or bath salts, with "no accepted medical use."
Still, the "green rush," as it's known, is growing rapidly. According to data from Arcview Market Research, the North American legal market grew by an unprecented 30% in 2016 to $6.7B. Arcview's new editor-in-chief, Tom Adams, told Forbes, "The only consumer industry categories I've seen reach $5B in annual spending and then post anything like 25% compound annual growth in the next five years are cable television (19%) in the 1990s and the broadband internet (29%) in the 2000s."
