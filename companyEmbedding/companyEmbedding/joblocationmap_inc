	OVERVIEW





	 




	JobLocationMap.
	is a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on June 15, 2010 and are engaged in the development of visual
	job search service that will put together job seekers and employers in JobLocationMap.com.  Our fiscal year end is December
	31, and we have no subsidiaries. Our website aims to provide job seekers and employers with a platform to share their valid address
	and contact information to be shown as a pin on our provided map, manage their job description or their resume, and interact with
	a community of Job searcher and employers from around the world. Social networking will be utilized as a sales component of the
	site and the platform itself is not social networking.




	  




	Our
	business offices are currently located at 153 W. Lake Mead Pkwy #2240, Henderson, NV 89015.   Our telephone number is
	702-586-1138. We have a website located at www.JobLocationMap.com, however, the information contained on our website does not
	form a part of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.




	 




	From
	our inception on June 15, 2010 to the present date, we have focused on organizational matters.  Since Aug 2012 we
	have been developing our social networking website for JobLocationMap searchers, www.JobLocationMap.com. Our website is currently
	in the development stage.  We expect our website to be ready for public launch within 6 months following successful
	completion of this Offering, provided that we have correctly estimated the funds required to execute our business plan. If we
	are successful in completing and launching our website, we anticipate that we will generate nominal revenues within 4 to 6 months
	following the website launch.  The platform website is ready for test, right now we are approaching few big employers to
	test the platform. We will fix bugs as they come along. We still need to finish the registration for the employers and employees.
	Our plans is to go online in 2 month after we finish fixing the bugs.




	 




	We
	have two executive officers, Mr. Omri Morchi and Ms. Eden Shoua, who also serve as our directors.  Both Mr. Morchi and
	Ms. Shoua, reside in Israel.  Mr. Morchi, our President and director, is a professional job hunter with more than 5
	years of experience as a Job hunter working at the AllJobs, the fourth largest Jobs website in Israel. Ms. Eden, our Secretary,
	Treasurer, and director, has 5 years of general business management, marketing, and logistics experience working in the public
	education sector




	 




	Though
	our website, www.JobLocationMap.ning.com is currently accessible it is not yet prepared for a full public launch.  It
	is currently in the testing phase as we are reviewing the operations of the social network and various features.  The
	website will likely remain accessible for some time as we troubleshoot and test various aspects of the system.  Our
	references to the ‘public launch’ of our site are specifically intended to refer to the time in our development when
	our website is complete and we begin engaging in marketing activities to generate awareness www.JobLocationMap.ning.com.




	  




	Additionally,
	we plan to hire a freelance graphic designer to revamp the overall visual appearance of our website and make it more appealing
	and modern. We anticipate the revamping of our website to take no longer than two months after the Offering is completed at a
	cost of $1,250. The revamping of our website is not essential for us to generate revenues.




	 




	Once
	the development of the website has been completed, we will publicly announce the launch of our new website. At this point in time
	our website will be ready to generate revenues.  We will then focus our efforts on driving visitors to our website by
	promoting our website with Google Adwords and making our website more accessible to visitors from other social networks such as
	Facebook and Twitter and by adding language translations to foreign visitors. We will also attempt to generate revenues by negotiating
	agreements with third-party merchants to display their goods on our site and pay us a commission if our visitors purchase their
	products.  We have not yet identified such merchants and there can be no assurance that we will be able to once we reach
	this stage in our business development.




	 




	We
	are building an App for use with iPhone and Android that users can search job listings to find a job location by map or use the
	App job search or browse jobs to find relevant employment opportunities in an individual’s area. This platform enables both
	employers and job seekers to find the perfect match with less time and effort.




	 







	 



	3



	 







	 









	 




	The
	App seeks to connect people to job opportunities, website global recruitment network, and to JobLocationMap platform. With the
	comprehensive platform we will be ready to launch technologies and versions of products supported by these technologies which
	will provide a "high efficiency and precision” user experience for employers and job seekers alike and help facilitate
	the ability to fill positions globally.




	  




	Businesses
	and job seekers using job search will experience a significant change in their user experience. Users will have more customized
	personal pages, more efficient resume management functions and over time, users will have access to more accurate search functionality.




	 




	Key
	features of the new platform upon launching include:




	 




	•       Advanced
	company recruitment branding products including branded job advertising, video and company profiles




	 




	•       Targeted
	local, regional and national postings job ads




	 




	•       Expanded
	sourcing productivity with new tools enabling candidate screening efficiency




	 




	•       Enhanced
	employer experience with expansive resources featuring content, and online support




	 




	•       Enhanced
	job seeker experience including streamlined job apply flows to increase seeker satisfaction and conversion




	 




	•       Career
	Advice Center with resume and interview tips and job hunt strategies




	 




	Provided
	we raise sufficient proceeds from the offering, of which there can be no assurance at the present time, we expect our website
	to be ready for public launch within 6 months following completion of this Offering and to start generating revenues within 4
	to 6 months following launch.




	 




	We
	are in the early stage of our business plan. We currently have no revenues and no user subscriptions for our website. Our activities
	to date have been limited to organizational matters, development of our business plan, development of our website, and efforts
	related to becoming a publicly traded company. The Company has already begun developing its website and has contracted with a
	consultant to prepare such site. The Company has a set business plan which does not include the merger or acquisition with any
	other entity.




	 




	Our
	offices are currently located at 153 W. Lake Mead Pkwy #2240, Henderson, Nevada 89015.  The address of agent for service
	in Nevada and registered corporate office is c/o EastBiz.com, Inc., 5348 Vegas Dr., Las Vegas, NV 89108 USA. Our telephone number
	is 702-586-1138. We have a website at www.JobLocationMap.ning.com, however, the information contained on our website does not
	form a part of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.




	 




	We
	have never declared bankruptcy, never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since
	becoming incorporated, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor have we been involved in any mergers,
	acquisitions or consolidations. Neither JobLocationMap nor our officers, directors, promoters or affiliates, has had preliminary
	contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with any representatives
	of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger.




	  




	The
	Company is an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.




	 




	The
	Company shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of--




	  




	‘(A)
	the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount
	is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
	published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;




	 




	‘(B)
	the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities
	of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement under this title;




	 







	 



	4



	 







	 









	 




	‘(C)
	the date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt;
	or




	 




	‘(D)
	the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title
	17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.’.




	 




	As
	an emerging growth company the company is exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish
	information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial
	reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures.




	 




	Section
	404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness
	of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.




	 




	As
	an emerging growth company the company is exempt from Section 14A and B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the
	shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes.




	 




	The
	Company has irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant
	to Section 107(b) of the Act.




	 





	SOCIAL
	NETWORKING WEBSITES, GENERALLY





	 




	Social
	networking websites provide internet users with services that allow them to form, join, or participate in online communities and
	to communicate with others regarding common interests and pursuits. Social networking websites have experienced increasing popularity
	in the last decade, and many sites have grown into broad networks encompassing tens of millions of users.  Our management
	believes that the popularity of general interest social networking sites such as Facebook has opened the door for more specialized
	and exclusive services that cater to special interest groups.




	  





	REVENUE
	MODEL





	 




	We
	plan to generate revenue from the following:




	  





	ADVERTISEMENT
	SPACE





	 




	One
	of the major benefits of advertising on a social networking site is that advertisers can take advantage of the users’ demographic
	information and target their ads appropriately. We intend to sell advertisement space to companies who are interested in targeting
	our subscribers.   We intend to sell advertising space on our website at a rate of $15 to $50 per thousand instances
	of an ad appearing on the website. Advertisements will appear on all of our web pages in a vertically oriented sidebar.




	 




	We
	also intend to participate in the Google AdSense service. Google AdSense is a free service, which displays text-only ads that
	correspond to the keywords of the content of the page on which the ad is shown.  Each time a user of a host website
	clicks on an AdSense advertisement, Google provides a flat fee to the operators of that website on behalf of the applicable advertiser.
	We were experimenting with the integration of “dummy” advertisements by Google with our social network website, and
	we have since removed these advertisements. We have not yet applied to Google AdSense program but do intend to do so once our
	website has been publicly launched. We did not generate any AdSense related income and since Google pays a different fee rate
	according to the niche your website occupies, we do not yet know what this fee will be.




	 





	COMPETITION
	AND COMPETITIVE STRATEGY





	 




	The
	social networking website industry is highly competitive and, at times, subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and industry
	trends. Competition is generally a function of the website’s brand strength and the success of its marketing strategies,
	its user capacity and reliability, and its ability to accommodate and integrate evolving technology and features (such as smart-phone
	or Twitter compatibility, for example).  Additionally, with regard to the online retail component of our business, competition
	is generally a function of the assortment and continuity of product selection offered, reliability, and the level of support for
	products offered.

	We
	will be required to compete with a large number of niche social networking and merchandising websites, many of which have significantly
	greater resources than we do. Many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market products and services similar
	to (and competitive with) our products and services. We believe that we are currently one of the smallest in the industry, as
	we currently have only a nominal web presence and no revenues from our business operations.




	 




	Management
	believes we can offset any such competitive disadvantages by being a price leader in the marketplace, first by offering free access
	to our website, and thereafter by offering more competitively priced premium services. Initially, general subscriptions to our
	site will be free and premium subscriptions will be only approximately $4.99 per month. We will also seek to differentiate ourselves
	by providing our subscribers with more attractive social network features, such as tools for subscribers to easily communicate
	with each other.




	 

	 






	MARKETING
	& SALES STRATEGY





	 




	The
	use of Internet is continuing to evolve as a global platform for doing business. Our major focus in the first year will be
	to use Google Adwords program in order to drive traffic to our own website. We plan to take advantage of the well established
	Google Adwords marketing program which places online ads on the search result pages of Internet users. Google uses an advertising
	methodology referred to as cost-per-click (“CPC”) in its Adwords program. Using this strategy will allow us to design
	our own ads, and to select target locations such as a city or state and use keywords in our ads. A keyword is a word that is used
	by an Internet user who is performing an online search to find out information on a specific topic.




	  




	Our
	primary target market is focused on Internet users who already participate in social networking websites. With CPC advertising,
	we only pay for the number of actual clicks on our advertisement. Each time someone clicks on our Google ad they will be redirected
	to our web site. A CPC-based advertising strategy is cost effective because an advertiser only pays for the leads they receive.
	The CPC marketing campaign is an integral part of our long term strategy




	 




	Our
	marketing campaign will monitor daily statistics and track favorite topics in order to quickly get in sync with our Internet audience.
	This is a significant part of our branding strategy.




	 





	ONLINE
	ADVERTISING





	 




	The
	majority of our advertising and promotional activities will be concentrated on an online advertising campaign using Google Adwords.
	We have selected Google because of its success and popularity for web users wishing to find something using an internet search.
	The Google Adwords program will allow us to customize the text of our advertisements, the frequency of each advertisement's appearance,
	and the length of the advertising contract. For our purposes, we believe that this will give us the maximum amount of flexibility
	and allow us to closely monitor the costs of the marketing campaign.




	 





	EMAIL
	ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN





	 




	We
	anticipate that an information style email advertising campaign may help to enhance our online advertising campaign and bring
	us into direct contact with people who are interested in using our services. In this regard, we are considering acquiring email
	lists, which may be done on an incremental basis so as not to incur a large expense before determining whether an email campaign
	works and meets our expectations.




	 




	We
	have budgeted a minimum of $5,000 and a maximum of $10,000 for advertising, marketing and sales during the 12 months following
	completion of this Offering. Mr. Shamir Benita will be responsible to manage all of our marketing and sales activities.





	 






	OPTIMIZING
	OUR WEBSITE





	 




	We
	plan to work with the web site development contractor to develop a series of meta-tags for each of the pages of our web site.
	Meta-tags are keywords that are added to a web page to make it easier to find that specific web page through search engines, web
	browser software and other applications. The information is not intended to be seen by the casual Internet user. Search engines
	like Google and Yahoo are designed to seek out these keywords when someone is performing an Internet search for a specific topic.
	By including meta-tags such we will be able to help drive more traffic to our web site.

	As
	our business begins to gain subscribers and become known in the industry we plan to conduct our own online survey questionnaires
	from the home page of our web site.




	 





	SOURCES
	AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES





	 




	We
	will be developing our own website, and the distribution of our website services will be over the Internet.  We intend
	to engage the services of independent contractors in relation to web design and programming as we may require. We believe there
	are no constraints on the sources or availability of products, supplies, or suppliers related to our business.




	  

	 






	PATENTS,
	TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, FRANCHISE RESTRICTIONS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & CONCESSIONS





	 




	We
	have not entered into any franchise agreements or other contracts that have given, or could give rise to, obligations or concessions.
	We are planning to develop our website and intend to protect its contents by registering for appropriate copyright and trademark
	protection where our management deems such registration necessary or beneficial. We have not conducted any independent searches
	or other inquiry into patents or other intellectual property which may be owned by others and which may constrain our business
	plan, nor have we received independent opinions of counsel on such matters.  Beyond our trade name, we do not hold any
	other intellectual property rights.




	 





	EFFECT
	OF EXISTING OR PROBABLE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.





	 




	We
	do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.  Given the
	content that will be available on our website, we will implement appropriate safeguards and electronic warnings to ensure that
	visitors to our site are aware of any restrictions that may be applicable to them while visiting our site. The regulation of the
	internet is in its infancy and still developing. The site will limit access to personal information to members and disclose the
	Company’s policy regarding non release of such information to non-members.




	 





	RESEARCH
	AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND COSTS





	 




	We
	have not incurred any research and development costs to date. We have plans to undertake certain research and development activities
	during the first year of operation related to the development of our website. For additional details please see "Management's
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Plan of Operation" below.




	 





	EMPLOYEES





	 




	We
	have commenced only limited operations, and therefore currently have no employees other than our officers/directors, who each
	spend approximately 15 to 20 hours a week on our business as is required.  Mr. Morchi and Ms. Shoua are both engaged
	with other businesses which will occupy the remainder of their working time every week.  Although neither Mr. Morchi
	or Ms. Shoua are under obligation to provide a minimum quantity of hourly services, they do not anticipate providing less than
	6 hours per week of service in order to perform basic corporate maintenance and book keeping. Further details on these businesses
	can be found in the “Management” section below.  We will consider retaining full-time management and administrative
	support personnel as our business and operations increase.  We do not foresee engaging full-time management or administrative
	support personnel during the next 12 months.




	 




	Over
	the next 12 months, Mr.Omri Morchi will be primarily responsible for:




	 




	-
	General management of our company's operations 




	 




	-
	Management and direction of financing activities

	Recent

	On
	August 29, 2012, we issued 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to Omri Morchi, our President and Director, for
	a purchase price of $0.003 per share, or for aggregate proceeds of $12,000.




	  




	On
	August 29, 2012, we issued 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to Eden Shoua, our Treasurer, Secretary and Director,
	for a purchase price of $0.003 per share, or for aggregate proceeds of $12,000.




	 




	On
	September 26, 2014, we issued 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to various Investors, for a sale price of $0.04
	per share, or for aggregate proceeds of $60,000.




	 




	 We
	believe that the issuances of the securities set forth above were exempt from registration as offerings completed under Regulation
	S of the Securities Act and the regulations promulgated there under. We believed that this exemption from registration was available
	for each transaction because each purchaser represented to us, among other things, that he was a non-U.S. person as defined in
	Regulation S, was not acquiring the shares for the account or benefit of, directly or indirectly, any U.S. person, he had the
	intention to acquire the securities for investment purposes only and not with a view to or for sales in connection with any distribution
	thereof, and that he was sophisticated and was able to bear the risk of loss of his entire investment.  Further, appropriate
	legends were affixed to the certificates for the securities issued in such transactions and we did not otherwise engage in distribution
	of these shares in the US.

	Results
	of Operations






	 








	Comparison
	for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015








	 







	Revenues






	 




	During
	the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 we have not generated any revenue.





	 







	Operating
	Expenses 






	 




	The
	Company’s operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 is $14,060 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 is
	$48,003. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 consist of Professional Fees $9,075 and General Administrative
	expenses $4,985. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 consist of Professional Fees $42,900 and General Administrative
	expenses $5,103.





	 






	Net
	Loss





	 




	During
	the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized net losses of $14,060 and $48,003.





	 







	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	On
	December 31, 2016, we had total current assets of $0 and total current liabilities of $17,374 which consist of $7,800 in accounts
	payable, accrual expenses $1,301 and $8,273 in loan from related party. On December 31, 2015, we had total current assets of $1,671
	which consist of $1,671 in cash and cash equivalents and total current liabilities of $4,985 which consist of $3,944 in loan from
	related party and $1,041 in accrual expenses.




	 




	Historically,
	we have financed our cash flow and operations from the sale of common stock and loan from related party.  Net cash provided
	by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4,329 which consists of loan from related party $4,329. During
	December 31, 2015 was $0.




	 




	We
	have not yet generated any revenue from our operations. We will require additional funds to fully implement our plans. These funds
	may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership
	of our shares. We currently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when
	required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing, a successful marketing and promotion program and, further
	in the future, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in
	a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would
	be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.   We will require additional funds to
	maintain our reporting status with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Nevada.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	We
	have incurred net losses since our inception on June 10, 2010 through December 31, 2016 totaling $94,874 and have completed only
	the preliminary stages of our business plan.  We anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues
	and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability.  Our
	ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is
	uncertain.  Accordingly, our independent auditors’ report on our financial statements for the year ended December
	31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional
	information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure.  The
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.




	 





	Recently
	Issued Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	We
	do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of
	operations, financial position, or cash flows.

	REPORT
	OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT AUDITORS








	 


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders


	of JobLocationMap Inc.:


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
	of JobLocationMap Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity,
	and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
	responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audit in accordance with standards
	of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
	audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
	required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
	consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
	financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
	estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides
	a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of JobLocationMap Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been
	prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company
	has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As such, it has incurred an operating loss since inception.
	Further, as of as December 31, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its planned business objectives.
	These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s
	plan regarding these matters is also described in Note B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTES
	TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	DECEMBER
	31, 2016






	 






	NOTE
	A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 





	A
	summary of significant accounting policies of JobLocationMap (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s
	financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements.
	These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity
	and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose.




	 





	Organization,
	Nature of Business and Trade Name





	 




	JobLocationMap
	(the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 15, 2010. JobLocationMap’s principal business objective of
	developing and marketing an online map application.




	 




	The
	Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to
	operationalize the Company’s online map application before another company develops a similar app.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	For
	purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three
	months or less to be cash equivalents.







	Property
	and Equipment





	 




	Property
	and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments
	that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
	related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the
	period.




	 




	Depreciation
	is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated
	useful lives of depreciable assets are:




	 







	 


	 


	Estimated




	 


	 


	Useful Lives




	Office Equipment


	 


	5-10 years




	Copier


	 


	5-7   years




	Vehicles


	 


	5-10 years






	 




	For
	federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements
	purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.




	 




	The
	Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. The Company currently does not have
	any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment.

	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	On
	June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
	(Topic 915).   Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage
	entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US
	GAAP.  In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
	information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a
	development stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
	and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
	in the development stage.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and
	interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim
	reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued.

	recognition




	 



	The
	Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605-35 “Revenue Recognition”.  Revenue
	is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, all obligations have been performed pursuant
	to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured.  The Company recognizes revenues on sales
	of its services, based on the terms of the customer agreement.  The customer agreement takes the form of either a contract
	or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price.  If
	the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized at the time the service
	is provided to the customer.




	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments




	 




	The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that
	are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as
	the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
	participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required
	to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact
	and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such
	as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following
	hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy
	upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:




	 





	Level
	1

	– Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.




	 





	Level
	2

	– Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices
	for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
	by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.




	 





	Level
	3

	– Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market
	participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.




	 




	In
	accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain
	other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.





	 





	As
	of December 31, 2016 and December 31,2015 the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at
	fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.

	Advertising
	expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred.

	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period.  A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on JobLocationMap’s financial
	condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	JobLocationMap’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation
	of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.




	 





	Capital
	Stock





	 




	The
	Company has authorized One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 and Fifty Million
	(50,000,000) shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001. Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand (9,500,000) shares of common
	stock were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.




	  





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net
	income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes.




	 





	NOTE
	B – GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
	to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
	However, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to
	continue as a going concern.




	 




	Under
	the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither
	the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations.
	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge
	its liabilities in the normal course of business.



	 



	The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described
	in the Nature of Business and Trade Name paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements
	do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.



	 



	During
	the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its
	business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
	payment of expenses associated with research and development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise
	additional capital.



	 



	Historically,
	it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and
	growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through
	loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s
	failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.



	 



	In
	the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock and loan from
	related party. For the coming year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances
	until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above.

	On
	September 26, 2014, Company issued 1,500,000 Common Shares of the company at $0.04 per share for cash proceeds of $60,000.





	 






	NOTE
	D – INCOME TAXES





	 




	For
	the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company has incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred
	tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is
	$94,874 at December 31, 2016, and will expire beginning in the year 2032.




	 




	The
	provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate
	of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

	income tax reporting purposes could be subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry
	forwards may be limited as to use in future years.




	 




	The
	Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability.

	EVALUATION
	OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 




	As
	of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rule 13-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) under the supervision
	and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on and as of the
	date of such evaluation, the aforementioned officers have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
	were not effective.




	 




	The
	Company also maintains a system of internal accounting controls that is designed to provide assurance that assets are safeguarded
	and that transactions are executed in accordance with management’s authorization and properly recorded. This system is continually
	reviewed and is augmented by written policies and procedures, the careful selection and training of qualified personnel and an
	internal audit program to monitor its effectiveness.




	 




	MANAGEMENT'S
	REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING




	 




	Management
	is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
	and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management
	and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
	reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting




	principles.
	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:




	 







	•



	Pertain
	to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
	the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;





	 






	•



	Provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
	of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
	the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
	made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
	and





	 







	•




	Provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
	use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
	statements.






	 




	Management
	assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment,
	we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in INTERNAL CONTROL
	-- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.




	 




	Our
	management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the
	criteria in INTERNAL CONTROL -- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by the COSO.




	 




	CHANGES
	IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING




	 




	There
	were no significant changes in the Company’s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
	controls as of the end of the fiscal year and up to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There were no significant
	deficiencies or material weaknesses, and therefore there were no corrective actions taken. It should be noted that any system
	of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives
	of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
	of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design
	will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.

	Ms.
	Eden Shoua





	 




	Ms.
	Shoua is Our Treasurer, Secretary and director, and has served on our Board of Directors since June 15, 2010.




	 




	Between
	the years of 2006- 2010 Eden took a few courses online marketing and sales in the college named Marketwise The heart of marketing
	consists of a sequence of activities : identifying customer needs, developing goods and services to satisfy those needs, communicating
	information about products to potential customers, and distributing the products to customers.




	 




	In
	2006 Eden finished high school in marketing and sales since then till today she is providing her marketing skills and leadership
	training to organizations, including manufacturing firms, service firms, retailers, wholesalers, advertising agencies, the communications
	media, and government agencies include sales, advertising, retailing, brand management, logistics management, market research,
	purchasing management and more.




	  





	Board
	Composition





	 




	Our
	Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of no less than 1, but not more than 9 directors. Each director serves
	until his successor is elected and qualified.




	 





	Committees
	of the Board of Directors





	 




	We
	do not presently have a separately constituted audit committee, compensation committee, nominating committee, executive committee
	or any other committees of our Board of Directors. Nor do we have an audit committee “financial expert.” As such,
	our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee and handles matters related to compensation and nominations of directors.




	 





	Potential
	Conflicts of Interest





	 




	Since
	we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed
	by such committees are performed by our directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers
	have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions.
	We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors.




	 





	Director
	Independence





	 




	We
	are not subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or national securities association and, as a result,
	we are not at this time required to have our board comprised of a majority of “independent directors.” Our determination
	of independence of directors is made using the definition of “independent director” contained in Rule 4200(a) (15)
	of the Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”), even though such definitions do not currently apply
	to us because we are not listed on NASDAQ. We have determined that none of our directors currently meet the definition of “independent”
	as within the meaning of such rules as a result of their current positions as our executive officers.




	 





	Significant
	Employees





	 




	We
	have no significant employees other than the executive officers/directors described above.




	 





	Family
	Relationships





	 




	There
	are no familial relationships between our officers and directors.




	 







	 



	15



	 







	 









	 





	Involvement
	in Certain Legal Proceedings





	 




	No
	director, person nominated to become a director, executive officer, promoter or control person of our company has, during the
	last ten years: (i) been convicted in or is currently subject to a pending a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations
	and other minor offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction
	and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting
	or mandating activities subject to any federal or state securities or banking or commodities laws including, without limitation,
	in any way limiting involvement in any business activity, or finding any violation with respect to such law, nor (iii) any bankruptcy
	petition been filed by or against the business of which such person was an executive officer or a general partner, whether at
	the time of the bankruptcy or for the two years prior thereto.




	 

	 






	Stockholder
	Communications with the Board





	 




	We
	have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors.
	Nevertheless, every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual
	directors, as applicable, and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are
	responsive to stockholder communications, and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder
	communications with our Board. During the upcoming year, our Board will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to
	adopt such a process.





	 







	Item
	11. Executive Compensation





	 




	We
	have not paid since our inception, nor do we owe, any compensation to our executive officers, Mr. Omri Morchi and Eden Shoua.
	There are no arrangements or employment agreements with our executive officer or directors pursuant to which they will be compensated
	now in the future for any services provided as an executive officer, and we do not anticipate entering into any such arrangements
	or agreements with them in the foreseeable future.

	Outstanding
	Equity Awards at December 31, 2015 Fiscal Year-End





	 




	We
	do not currently have a stock option plan or any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive
	for performance. No individual grants of stock options or other equity incentive awards have been made to any executive officer
	or any director since our inception; accordingly, none were outstanding at December 31, 2016.




	 





	Employment
	Contracts, Termination of Employment, Change-in-Control Arrangements





	 




	There
	are currently no employments or other contracts or arrangements with our executive officers. There are no compensation plans or
	arrangements, including payments to be made by us, with respect to our officers, directors or consultants that would result from
	the resignation, retirement or any other termination of such directors, officers or consultants from us. There are no arrangements
	for directors, officers, employees or consultants that would result from a change-in-control.

	Item
	12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholders Matters






	 





	The
	following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of December 31, 2016 for:




	 






	•  




	each
	person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock;






	 






	•  




	each
	of our executive officers;






	 






	•  




	each
	of our directors; and






	 






	•  




	all
	of our executive officers and directors as a group.






	 




	We
	have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These rules generally
	attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect
	to those securities. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire
	beneficial ownership within 60 days. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities identified in this table have sole voting
	and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable community property
	laws, and the address for each person listed in the table is c/o JobLocationMap, 153 W. Lake Mead Pkwy #2240, Henderson, NV 89015.




	 




	The
	percentage ownership information shown in the table below is calculated based on 9,500,000 shares of our common stock issued and
	outstanding as of December 31, 2016. We do not have any outstanding options, warrants or other securities exercisable for or convertible
	into shares of our common stock.

	We

	of our Company.




	 




	We
	do not have any issued and outstanding securities that are convertible into common stock. None of our stockholders are entitled
	to registration rights.






	 







	 

	Item
	13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence






	 






	It
	is our practice and policy to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding related person transactions, including
	the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. A related person is an executive officer, director or more than 5% stockholder of JobLocationMap,
	including any immediate family members, and any entity owned or controlled by such persons. Our Board of Directors (excluding
	any interested director) is charged with reviewing and approving all related-person transactions, and a special committee of our
	Board of Directors is established to negotiate the terms of such transactions. In considering related-person transactions, our
	Board of Directors takes into account all relevant available facts and circumstances.






	 








	 



	17



	 







	 










	 




	Director
	Independence




	 



	Our
	Board of Directors has adopted the definition of “independence” as described under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002
	(Sarbanes-Oxley) Section 301, Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and NASDAQ Rules 4200 and
	4350. Our Board of Directors has determined that its member does not meet the independence requirements.



	 




	Certain
	Relationships and Related Transactions






	 





	On
	or about August 29, 2012, Mr. Morchi and Ms. Shoua each subscribed to 4,000,000 shares at $0.003 per share.




	 




	There
	have been no other transactions since the beginning of our last fiscal year or any currently proposed transactions in which we
	are, or plan to be, a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at
	year end for the last two completed fiscal years, and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material
	interest.




	 




	Mr.
	Morchi and Ms. Shoua are our only promoters as defined in Rule 405 of Regulation C due to their participation in and management
	of the business since our incorporation.






	 








	Item
	14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services





	 





	Audit
	Fees






	 





	The
	aggregate fees billed during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 for professional services rendered by Weinberg
	& Baer LLC, with respect to the audits of our 2016 and 2015 financial statements, as well as their quarterly reviews of our
	interim financial statements and services normally provided by the independent accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory
	filings or engagements for these fiscal periods, were as follows:




	 







	 


	 



	Year Ended December 31,

	In
	the above table, "audit fees" are fees billed by our Company's external auditor for services provided in auditing our
	Company's annual financial statements for the subject year. "Audit-related fees" are fees not included in audit fees
	that are billed by the auditor for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit
	review of our company's financial statements. "Tax fees" are fees billed by the auditor for professional services rendered
	for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.




	 




	"All
	other fees" are fees billed by the auditor for products and services not included in the foregoing categories.




	 





	Pre
	Approval Policies and Procedures





	 




	We
	do not have a separately designated Audit Committee. The Board of Directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent
	auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors either before or after the respective
	services were rendered.

	1.
	I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of JobLocationMap.




	 




	2.
	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to date a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
	to the period covered by this report;




	 




	3.
	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
	material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the small business issuer as of, and for, the
	periods presented in this report;




	 




	4.
	The small business issuer’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure
	controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(3)) and internal control over financial reporting
	(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) for the small business issuer and have:




	 







	a.



	Designed
	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the small business issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
	to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the report is being prepared;






	 







	b.



	Designed
	such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
	our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;






	 







	c.



	Evaluated
	the effectiveness of the small business issuer’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
	such evaluation; and






	 







	d.



	Disclosed
	in this report any change in the small business issuer’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
	the small business issuer’s most recent fiscal quarter (the small business issuer’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case
	of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the small business issuer’s
	internal control over financial reporting; and






	 




	5.
	The small business issuer's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
	over financial reporting, to the small business issuer's auditors and the audit committee of the small business issuer's board
	of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	 




	(a)
	all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the small business issuer's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
	information; and




	 




	(b)
	any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the small business
	issuer's internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock
offered at a public offering price of $0.04 per share will vary depending upon
the total number of Shares actually sold. Regardless of the number of shares
sold, we expect to incur Offering expenses estimated at approximately $12,500.00
for legal, printing, and other costs in connection with this Offering.

The table below sets forth the net proceeds that we will receive from this
Offering in the event that we sell the full amount of the offering. This table
does not set forth all possibilities. There is no guarantee that we will be
successful at selling any of the securities being offered in this prospectus.
Accordingly, the actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this Offering, if
any, may differ.

* Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this Offering. The
expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity.

Our offering expenses of approximately $12,500 are comprised primarily of legal
expenses, Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and EDGAR filing fees,
printing and transfer agent fees, and any necessary state registration fees. Our
officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their efforts in
selling our shares.

If we are not able to sell all of the shares our common stock registered in this
Offering, we will not implement our business plan at all, except maintaining our
reporting with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Nevada. We
will also need more funds if the costs of developing our website are greater
than we have budgeted. We will also require additional financing to sustain our
business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues. These funds
may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which
may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We currently
do not have any arrangements regarding this Offering or following this Offering
for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required.
Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further financing, the
successful development of our website, a successful marketing and promotion
program, attracting and, further in the future, achieving a profitable level of
operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a
significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders.
Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will
increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  There are no assurances
that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued
operations. As widely reported, the global and domestic financial markets have
been extremely volatile in recent months. If such conditions and constraints
continue, we may not be able to acquire additional funds either through credit
markets or through equity markets. Even if additional financing is available, it
may not be available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no
anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed
additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in
business.

We may change the use of proceeds because of changes in our business plan.
Investors should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of
proceeds.


The social networking website industry is highly competitive and, at times, 
subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and industry trends. 
Competition is generally a function of the website’s brand strength and the 
success of its marketing strategies, its user capacity and reliability, and its 
ability to accommodate and integrate evolving technology and features (such as 
smart-phone or Twitter compatibility, for example).  Additionally, with regard 
to the online retail component of our business, competition is generally a 
function of the assortment and continuity of product selection offered, 
reliability, and the level of support for products offered. 

We will be required to compete with a large number of niche social networking 
and merchandising websites, many of which have significantly greater resources 
than we do. Many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market 
products and services similar to (and competitive with) our products and 
services. We believe that we are currently one of the smallest in the industry, 
as we currently have only a nominal web presence and no revenues from our 
business operations. 

Management believes we can offset any such competitive disadvantages by being a 
price leader in the marketplace, first by offering free access to our website, 
and thereafter by offering more competitively priced premium services. 
Initially, general subscriptions to our site will be free and premium 
subscriptions will be only approximately $4.99 per month. We will also seek to 
differentiate ourselves by providing our subscribers with more attractive 
social network features, such as tools for subscribers to easily communicate 
with each other.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock
offered at a public offering price of $0.04 per share will vary depending upon
the total number of Shares actually sold. Regardless of the number of shares
sold, we expect to incur Offering expenses estimated at approximately $12,500.00
for legal, printing, and other costs in connection with this Offering.

The table below sets forth the net proceeds that we will receive from this
Offering in the event that we sell the full amount of the offering. This table
does not set forth all possibilities. There is no guarantee that we will be
successful at selling any of the securities being offered in this prospectus.

any, may differ.

As of December 31, 2012 Cash in hand                  14,000   

* Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this Offering. The
expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity.

Our offering expenses of approximately $12,500 are comprised primarily of legal
expenses, Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and EDGAR filing fees,
printing and transfer agent fees, and any necessary state registration fees. Our
officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their efforts in
selling our shares.

If we are not able to sell all of the shares our common stock registered in this
Offering, we will not implement our business plan at all, except maintaining our
reporting with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Nevada. We
will also need more funds if the costs of developing our website are greater
than we have budgeted. We will also require additional financing to sustain our
business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues. These funds
may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which
may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We currently
do not have any arrangements regarding this Offering or following this Offering
for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required.
Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further financing, the
successful development of our website, a successful marketing and promotion
program, attracting and, further in the future, achieving a profitable level of
operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a
significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders.
Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will
increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  There are no assurances
that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued
operations. As widely reported, the global and domestic financial markets have
been extremely volatile in recent months. If such conditions and constraints
continue, we may not be able to acquire additional funds either through credit
markets or through equity markets. Even if additional financing is available, it
may not be available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no
anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed
additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in
business.

We may change the use of proceeds because of changes in our business plan.
Investors should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of
proceeds.


The social networking website industry is highly competitive and, at times, 
subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and industry trends. 
Competition is generally a function of the website’s brand strength and the 
success of its marketing strategies, its user capacity and reliability, and its 
ability to accommodate and integrate evolving technology and features (such as 
smart-phone or Twitter compatibility, for example).  Additionally, with regard 
to the online retail component of our business, competition is generally a 
function of the assortment and continuity of product selection offered, 
reliability, and the level of support for products offered. 

We will be required to compete with a large number of niche social networking 
and merchandising websites, many of which have significantly greater resources 
than we do. Many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market 
products and services similar to (and competitive with) our products and 
services. We believe that we are currently one of the smallest in the industry, 
as we currently have only a nominal web presence and no revenues from our 
business operations. 

Management believes we can offset any such competitive disadvantages by being a 
price leader in the marketplace, first by offering free access to our website, 
and thereafter by offering more competitively priced premium services. 
Initially, general subscriptions to our site will be free and premium 
subscriptions will be only approximately $4.99 per month. We will also seek to 
differentiate ourselves by providing our subscribers with more attractive 
social network features, such as tools for subscribers to easily communicate 
with each other.
