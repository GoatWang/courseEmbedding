BRE Select Hotels Announcement Regarding Unsolicited Tender Offer by MacKenzie Capital Management for Preferred Shares | Business Wire


























































BRE Select Hotels Announcement Regarding Unsolicited Tender Offer by 
      MacKenzie Capital Management for Preferred Shares






March 11, 2016 05:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BRE Select Hotels Corp (the “Company”) has recently been informed of an 
      unsolicited tender offer by affiliates of MacKenzie Capital Management, 
      LP (collectively, “MacKenzie”) to buy up to 1,000,000 shares of the 
      Company’s 7% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the 
      “Preferred Shares”) at a price of $1.45 per share, less any cash 
      distributions made by the Company after March 1, 2016 (the “MacKenzie 
      Offer”). Given that the Company currently expects to declare a cash 
      dividend of $0.0333 per share, payable on April 15, 2016 to holders of 
      record of Preferred Shares on April 1, 2016, the adjusted price of the 
      MacKenzie Offer is $1.4167 per share.
    


      After careful evaluation of the terms of the MacKenzie Offer, neither 
      the Company nor the Company’s board of directors makes any 
      recommendation, and none of them has authorized any person to make any 
      recommendation, as to whether the holders of Preferred Shares should 
      tender or refrain from tendering Preferred Shares in the MacKenzie 
      Offer. However, shareholders should consider the following:
    


        MacKenzie’s adjusted offer price of $1.4167 per share represents an 
        approximately 25% discount to the initial liquidation preference of 
        $1.90 per Preferred Share. The adjusted offer price is also lower than 
        the $1.9281 per share price that the Company paid for the redemption 
        of 24,650,000 Preferred Shares on December 31, 2014 (the “2014 
        Redemption”). The redemption price in the 2014 Redemption equaled the 
        $1.90 liquidation preference per share plus accumulated and unpaid 
        dividends to and including the redemption date. Although the Company 
        may, at its option, redeem all or a portion of the Preferred Shares at 
        any time and will, under certain circumstances specified in the terms 
        of the Preferred Shares, be required to redeem all of the Preferred 
        Shares at a redemption price per share equal to the liquidation 
        preference (as it may be adjusted from time to time) plus any 
        accumulated and unpaid dividends, the Company does not currently 
        intend to, and there can be no assurance that in the future the 
        Company will, redeem any Preferred Shares, unless it is required to do 
        so under the terms of the Preferred Shares. On September 30, 2013, BRE 
        Select Hotels Holdings LP, the holder of all of the Company’s 
        outstanding common stock (“BRE Holdings”), purchased approximately 
        2 million Preferred Shares for $1.30 per share as part of a tender 
        offer extended to all holders of Preferred Shares in response to a 
        prior tender offer by MacKenzie. BRE Holdings does not intend to 
        provide shareholders with an offer in response to the pending 
        MacKenzie Offer.
      

        As described in the proxy statement/prospectus dated April 2, 2013 
        (the “Proxy Statement”) that was sent to the former shareholders of 
        Apple REIT Six, Inc. (“Apple Six”) in connection with the acquisition 
        of Apple Six and filed with the SEC on April 2, 2013, the initial 
        liquidation preference of $1.90 per share is subject to downward 
        adjustment should net costs and payments relating to certain 
        litigation and regulatory legacy matters exceed $3.5 million from the 
        date of the merger agreement between Apple Six, BRE Holdings and the 
        Company (November 29, 2012). The legacy matters are described under 
        “Legal Proceedings” on page 24 of the Company’s Quarterly Report on 
        Form 10-Q that was filed with the SEC on November 12, 2015. As of 
        today, the Company does not expect that the initial liquidation 
        preference will be adjusted.
      

        The MacKenzie Offer is limited to approximately 1.4% of the 
        outstanding Preferred Shares, only 1,000,000 shares out of the 
        72,382,848 outstanding Preferred Shares. MacKenzie offers to purchase 
        the 1,000,000 shares on a “first-come, first-buy” basis, based upon 
        the dates on which MacKenzie receives completed assignment forms. The 
        MacKenzie Offer therefore coerces holders of Preferred Shares to 
        tender their shares to MacKenzie as soon as possible, which could 
        deprive them of adequate time to evaluate the MacKenzie Offer.
      

        The coercive nature of the MacKenzie Offer is exacerbated by the fact 
        that holders of Preferred Shares will not have withdrawal rights. Thus 
        shareholders who tender shares to MacKenzie will not be able to 
        withdraw their shares. If a holder of Preferred Shares changes his, 
        her or its decision to tender during the term of the MacKenzie Offer, 
        whether due to changed circumstances relating to the Company or 
        relating to such holder, or to other factors, such holder will not be 
        able to withdraw tendered shares.
      

        There is no guarantee that the MacKenzie Offer will be completed. As 
        stated in “Terms, Conditions, Risks, and Disclosures” enclosed with 
        the offer letter dated March 1, 2016, MacKenzie will be able to 
        rescind its offer if there is a material adverse change in the 
        operations of the Company, and MacKenzie purports to define “material 
        adverse change” as a change that “would likely cause a reasonable 
        shareholder to reconsider the decision to buy or sell Shares.”
      


      Holders of Preferred Shares must make their own decision whether to 
      continue to hold their Preferred Shares or to tender their Preferred 
      Shares to MacKenzie and, if so, how many shares to tender, upon their 
      own assessment of the value of the Preferred Shares, and taking into 
      account that the Preferred Shares are not listed on any securities 
      exchange and no public market for the Preferred Shares exists, their 
      liquidity needs and any other factors they deem relevant. In doing so, 
      holders of Preferred Shares should read and evaluate carefully the 
      information in the offer materials provided by MacKenzie, the 
      information about the Company in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 
      10-K that was filed with the SEC on March 20, 2015, the Company’s 
      Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that was filed with the SEC on November 
      12, 2015 and its other filings with the SEC, and the information about 
      the terms of the Preferred Shares in the Proxy Statement.
    

      Neither the Company nor the Company’s board of directors or management 
      has hired any investment bank or other third party professional to 
      evaluate the fairness of the price offered by MacKenzie or the other 
      terms of the MacKenzie Offer. Holders of Preferred Shares should consult 
      with their personal financial advisor or other legal, tax or investment 
      professional(s) regarding their individual circumstances.

Worldwide Hotel Finder: Top Hotel Destinations
Popular Hotel Destinations in the Western U.S
When you book with Travelocity, the West Coast is your oyster. Enjoy the razzle and dazzle of fast-paced life in one of the big coastal cities, or pack up your ski equipment for the adventure of a lifetime. We offer a wide variety of accommodations to suit your tastes; rest in the penthouse suite of a five-star resort, or enjoy a home-cooked meal in a charming bed and breakfast. No matter where – or when – you want to get away, Travelocity is here to help you land the best deals swiftly and painlessly. Stop putting off that trip – adventure awaits.
The celebrities, the sports, the shopping… yes, you’ve heard stories of “Tinsel Town.” Isn’t it time for you to see if the tales are true? Check out Southern California’s allure for yourself when you book  hotels in Los Angeles.
Friend, they don’t call it “Sin City” for nothing. Cruise through the casinos, take a gondola ride, then rest up in Las Vegas hotels to do it all again in the morning. Or evening. Whatever suits you. 
Mark Twain once said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco. You’ll have to judge the truth of that for yourself – and try the famous clam chowder at Pier 39 while you’re at it – when you book a night in our San Francisco hotels.
Next up, glide down the California coastline to the other city by the bay. No matter when you reserve San Diego hotels, you’ll enjoy year-round sunshine, beautiful beaches, and yes, those famous burritos. 
Move inland toward Colorado and relax in the capital city – our hotels in Denver will take care of all your worries. Book that ski trip, sample craft brews, or just find new ways to get elevated in the “Mile-High City.”

Book Hotel Rooms on the East Coast
The East Coast of the United States has much to offer the discerning traveler hungry for adventure and a delicious meal. From sky-high suites with stunning views to delightful hospitality and fresh-squeezed orange juice at a bed and breakfast, we have accommodation for all tastes. As for the food, well, your new city has plenty in store for you. 
Take a seat at a raw bar on the Boston waterfront and partake of refreshing oysters straight from the sea – the terroir of Cape Cod Bay is spectacular. Encounter living history on the Freedom Trail, or rendezvous with Rembrandt and Monet at the Museum of Fine Arts. Rest assured that Boston hotels will always be ready with a soft pillow where you can lay your head and dream of tomorrow’s plans. 
Journey west to hotels in New York City and discover the treasures of America’s most spectacular metropolis. From the morning sun shining on the Statue of Liberty to the sparkling lights of the skyline at night, there is nothing like the Big Apple. As Sinatra said, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. 
The great William Smith once extolled the virtues of another celebrated East Coast city: Philadelphia. Travelocity’s hotels in Philadelphia are the perfect place to relax after a day spent dining on signature cheesesteak and reveling in America’s most important historical landmarks. 
Philly may be the site of politics past, but Washington, D.C. hotels are where today’s mavens meet and mingle. Travelocity will have you keeping company with the nation’s brass and taking in some of the world’s greatest museums before you can say “Let’s do brunch.” 
If you’re looking for a different kind of charm, perhaps it’s Charlotte hotels you seek. Settle in with a homemade sweet tea and enjoy the Southern hospitality. Later, venture downtown and find a darkened lounge brimming over with sultry blues music. Your East Coast vacation is complete.

Top Hotels in America's Midwest
The Midwest is home to some of America’s most vibrant cities, with world-class attractions and mouthwatering treats for all tastes. When you book with Travelocity, you’ll spend less time searching and more time dreaming of ice skating on a winter’s eve or a warm, cheesy slice of deep-dish pizza. Whatever your desires, the Midwest is a must-see stop for any traveler. 
Let’s begin our journey in the birthplace of that delectable deep-dish pizza we mentioned. Chicago hotels are about much more than tempting tidbits. Promenade along Navy Pier for waterfront tableaus or take yourself upward, to the top of the Willis Tower for sweeping skyline views. 
Hotels in Detroit offer up a whole new world of attractions, from lovely strolls in the gorgeous Belle Isle Park to perusing masterpieces at the Institute of Arts. Of course, you can always simply immerse yourself in the sultry tunes of Motown. 
Yearning for a summer frolic through gardens of modern sculpture? Or a winter’s afternoon spent gliding along a frozen lake followed by a steaming cup of hot chocolate? Hotels in Minneapolis are your home away from home for year-round outdoor adventure – plus so much quintessential Midwestern charm, you’ll never want to leave. 
Slip south to hotels in St. Louis to dine on the city’s renowned smoky barbecue and melt-in-your-mouth gooey butter cake. Then cross state lines to Malcolm Martin Memorial Park in Illinois for a million-dollar view of the Gateway Arch. 
If you like to spend your getaways wandering amongst quaint village enclaves with nary an itinerary in sight, Columbus hotels are your ideal match. Amble through historic architecture and urban gardens in the German Village neighborhood, then let butterflies alight on your shoulders at the Franklin Park Conservatory. In America’s Midwest, no dream goes unfulfilled – and no treasures go undiscovered when you let Travelocity be your guide.

Hotel Deals in Southern United States
Where do you find your travel inspiration? Is it in the enticing flavors of a new and exciting cuisine? Or in the beautiful sights and sounds of historic districts and vintage theatres? Whatever it is that fuels your appetite for adventure, the American South has it. Brimming with vibrant culture, savory dishes and year-round warmth, it’s always the ideal place for your next getaway. 
Many a traveler has felt the pull of the “Sunshine State”— after all, it’s difficult to resist more than a thousand miles of coastline and 250 days of bright skies. If you’re drawn to the allure of Miami hotels, recline in comfort on the famous sands of South Beach, then trade in your sandals and dress up for a festive soiree. Further north, America’s most well-known theme parks are at your doorstep with hotels in Orlando; along with world-class entertainment and dining outside the parks as well. 
For another city where the days are sunny and the nights are merry, explore Travelocity’s hotels in Atlanta. Spend an afternoon enveloped in the smells of hydrangeas and camellia as you wander the paths of the Atlanta Botanical Gardens in search of peaceful meditation spot. By night, stroll through the Fox Theatre Historic District and immerse yourself in the sights and sounds of outstanding ballet, symphony, and theatre productions. 
If you envision a vacation that boasts quintessential Southern charm and plenty of delectable morsels, a trip to Texas just may be in your future. Yearning to tempt your taste buds with juicy brisket that melts in your mouth, slaw, and whiskey cake? You’re in search of Dallas hotels, wise wanderer. However, no Texas tour is complete without a visit to the home of NASA, “Space City,” or the impressive Museum of Fine Arts, one of America’s largest. Travelocity’s hotels in Houston will certainly have you saying “The eagle has landed.”

Best International Hotel Accommodation
You’re a worldly sort, not the type to let those travel guidebooks gather dust, and your globe provides inspiration as much as decoration. But where to go next? From the cosmopolitan cities of Canada to the timeless destinations of Europe, there is no shortage of new places to explore. Delve into Travelocity’s incredible selection of international hotel accommodation and prepare for your next adventure. 
One of the world’s finest international destinations is close to home: Your northern neighbor. Canada has much more on its plate than poutine, the famous French fry and cheese curd combination. Reserve  Montreal hotels to experience its historic Old Port, glimpse the towering Notre-Dame Basilica, and stroll through one of the world’s largest botanical gardens. To the southwest, Toronto hotels stand ready to introduce you to this quirky, charming city. Home to the expansive, Frank Gehry-designed Art Gallery of Ontario and vibrant neighborhoods like Kensington Market and the Distillery District, Toronto is perfect for those savvy travelers who like something a little different. 
If your travel desires lie farther afield, you may need a trip to Europe. London hotels are the ideal destination for wise wanderers who seek extraordinary architecture, a thriving theatre scene— and of course, classic, wood-paneled pubs where you can sip a pint. Or, look into our hotels in Rome and travel even further back in time, to antiquity itself. Gaze up at the massive Colosseum and you’ll soon understand why its name so closely resembles “colossal.” Peruse artworks by the great masters at the Galleria Borghese and then bask in the sunshine in the adjoining park as you daydream. Continue your art tour of Europe with Paris hotels and traverse through the Louvre in pursuit of da Vinci and Michelangelo. Wherever your travels take you, go confidently: Travelocity is always here to help you find a comfortable place to rest your head.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
