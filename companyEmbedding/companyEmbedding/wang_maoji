Hack FAQ Volume 9 Released!
Wang Hack FAQ Volume 9 has finally been released. The faqs’s cover a range of up to date hacking/security/internet questions that you asked to be covered.
This volume I explain a number of hot topics at the moment, including “Hacking Web-based Email”, “What are SUID Binaries and why are they dangerous?”, and “Decrypting Trillian Passwords” to name a few. Check it out!
 
Access Granted for Access XP!
Access Granted has been updated with support to recover passwords for Microsoft Access XP databases, as well as Access 97 and Access 2000 databases. This has been a popular requested addition, and I am pleased to now offer the program available for download.
Access Granted can recover your lost database passwords in a matter of seconds. This is not a brute force encryption scheme, and therefore passwords are recovered extremely quickly.
