Pros
Not much. The orange guy logo? That about sums up my likes. I have nothing nice or positive to contribute.




Cons
Kareo is outdated and difficult to navigate compared to other available software. It lacks functionality and intuition, completely incapable of anticipating the needs of its user. The ability to sort through super bills is RIDICULOUSLY inefficient. (I have many examples of poor software design, that is making my life hell.) 

The soft ware has so many "An unexpected error has occurred" alerts that prevents me from entering the patient chart and no one on the support team ever knows how to fix it. I was unable to view my patient charts for 7 days with NO SOLUTION from program designers. There is a significant lack of accountability for their shortcomings which needs to be addressed urgently. I am getting further and further behind in my documentation because this error message prevents me from viewing notes at all. I have been told 2x now that a supervisor will call me back. NO ONE ever does. It was fixed very briefly last week, but here I am again... 

MASSIVE improvements to expand the functionality are needed. Kareo is not a big player in our market, and likely never will be if big changes are not made. Immediate attempts to find SOME tools that will drive efficiency are critical.  This EHR software is NOT designed to save medical organizations time and effort in processing patient information, as much as they may think it does.

Pros
We are switching from clinicsource to Kareo and so far we are loving the extra features we get - text/email alert for patients, ease of site navigation, multifunctionality and I absolutely love all the reports and tracking systems. I can't wait to see where are earning and losing money!




Cons
The only issue I keep hitting is the template system. I understand why it is as complicated as it is but I would love an even more comprehensive guide on how to create templates from scratch AND any templates related to speech therapy would be nice. There are ZERO at this time.

There is a lot of click here and click there to get anywhere, which I believe this software should be easier to use than the older software that we had, but it is not.  takes more time to do anything.  There is no discharge feature.  I wish customer service would be more helpful.  




Pros
Very inexpensive, easy set up.  Getting clearance from the insurances to switch over to the new clearing house was a piece of cake.  




Cons
customer service is hard to get once they think your all set.  So now I am trying to train myself.  UGH!!!!

Kareo is similar to PracticeFusion except they now charge a few for the EHR.  If the company had made changes in the operating platform to keep it modern like other programs on the market it would be great, not all programs have iPad apps; otherwise it's a waste of money and would recommend picking something different.




Pros
Familiar with software and functions.
Easy to use and maneuver.
Web-based and compatible with MAC.
iPad application available for tablet users.




Cons
Rates are fairly comparable with other EHR systems, however Kareo does not often the functions that are available on most EHRs.
Not compatible with all specialties.
Support is hit and miss.

Pros
Very easy to learn how to use on your own.  Other than that, it is not the easiest program to use for behavioral health.




Cons
Very slow and cumbersome and not user-friendly for counselors
1  Cannot enter groups all at once (having a preloaded listing of clients and enter a visit in and have it populate automatically in all their charts)
2  No treatment planning option at all; other programs have treatment plans that ties notes and counselors to specific treatment plans (cannot update them electronically); 
3  Even when you choose more than  10 clients per page, you still have to scroll down; window does not fit screen; if you get out of it, it defaults back to 10 clients; slows down progress
4  You should be able to print all notes out for client at one time

I have worked at both the state and federal level and while their systems were much more in-depth, they were more user-friendly and ease of navigation.

For a small practice, this is one of the. Ost cost effective programs I have seen. 




Pros
Progress note generates the billing. 
Professional reports, professional looking statements
Can add timed codes for medicare patients so you can avoid a billing error.
Can fax evaluation dirctly to MD upom creation
. 




Cons
Cannot have two "user windows" open at once without paying additional money for 2 PTs. For example, I would like to be able to document on my ipad while in a room with a patient, and then comp,ete the note on my PC in my main gym area. I have to exit out,then sign back in on a different device, taking 4 steps instead of 2. Doesnt sound like much, but adds up to a lot of time over the course of a day.
Many of the features have additional rcurring fees. (Schedule, outcomes,)

Not all fields are customizable. You can add "smart text" for frequently used phrases, but this option is not available on every field.
For example, cannot add smart text to the Plan, or to Assessment.  Have asked many times if could be added, but it has never been put in update.

After spending about 10-15 hours learning Kareo and starting to develop templates, I threw in the towel and canceled it.  Thank goodness I was on a free 30-day trial period.  The straw that broke the camel's back was not being able to schedule non-patient appointments and being told my request would not be dealt with by the engineers in the near future.  They have their "roadmap" set for the next few months already and take customer input on a quarterly basis.  




Pros
When I asked to speak to a manager, I got someone who was professional, nice, and apologetic for some problems I ran into.  The "success training coach" was very friendly and genuinely seemed like he wanted to help and accommodate any request.




Cons
The sales rep did not communicate to the "success training coach" what I needed to have my EHR configured.  We wasted hours on the phone trying to figure it out.  Had she just communicated my needs to him ahead of time, he could have solved the issues behind the scenes, instead of having me lose a few hours of valuable time.  After all of that, when I started using the system, I discovered you cannot book a non-patient appointment!!!  The system does not allow you to schedule meetings or non-patient related phone calls!

Pros
It's an elusive idea. You want positive reviews then provide the service your charging us for and fix all the issues and start implementing ALL the REPEATED requests for improvements to the system... Most years old!




Cons
Everything involving technical support from long hold times with terrible hold, technical support who are clueless of current, or any other, issues with this product.

Admittedly, we're still new, but we've been very pleased with the support we've been able to find through the help desk and the Facebook groups.  We've encountered a number of practices who have already worked out many of the issues we've encountered and have taught us a lot in the process.  We really like our success coach, and he's gone out of his way to help me work through some of the particular things my clients want.




Pros
It's easy to use, and cost-effective for us.




Cons
We wish they had a collections module.  Right now it's a VERY manual process.

I have been using kareo for more than 5 years. Lately the waiting time to talk to a customer service rep is too long.
most of the time we don't get the answer and will say we will get a call back. we never get a call back .
If we ask for help with EHR and templates most of the time they don't have the answer.
Also we have to pay for training session other than the initial session




Pros
Nothing at this time




Cons

I am currently using this EHR because my billing company recommended it since they use the Kareo practice management. It has been a nightmare for me having used a much better EHR - Athena. The onboarding process was a disaster and after 3 months, the lab integration has not been completed with labcorp and there is no follow-ups. I have to initiate every contact with my coach who should be reaching out to me to make sure that my transition to kareo is seamless. 

There is no integration with Imaging centers so you have to order the tests and then manually fax to the imaging center unlike Athena. 

When it comes to labs, you cannot find some of them like a common FIT test to screen for colon cancer.

How about e-prescribing? Forget about prescribing common diabetes supplies like test strips, lancet or OTC medications, they are not there. With Athena, once you start typing the name of the supply you need, it pulls everything up and you can transmit those to the pharmacy electronically. For those you now want to fax to the pharmacy manually, the pharmacy name, phone or fax # does not even show on the prescription so you have to go back to the patient's chart and go to somewhere in the demographics to find the fax # and then write it down or memorize before faxing.

When you place a referral, you cannot attach documents such as labs, radiology reports  to the referral before efaxing. What is the point efaxing just a referral and then printing out other relevant records that should accompany the referral to manually fax....so dumb.

How about releasing a patient result to their portal, you are not able to comment on the results that you are releasing to the patient. You have to send a different message to the patient after you have already released the results. Now, I keeping getting an error sending a message to patients through the portal using Google chrome browser and Firefox with different computers  and they don't have any clue what is going on. I can't get any help with the technical support or my coach. They created a case and that's it. I guess I need to be calling them and taking time from caring for the patients to be doing that before I can resolve any issues.




Pros
Frankly, I do not see any




Cons
Everything

I cannot honestly say that has given up much benefit = perhaps more options for reports.




Pros
lots of options in reports, but not easy to figure out.  colors of screens are easy on the eyes.  no other good comments.




Cons
Poor training.  poor customer service.  errors that I do not get answers on.  Does not pull in appointment code & ending date of service, using Care360 for EMR.  Pulling up info - not enough info shows.  No place to make recommendations (like when pulling up the list of "encounters", which insurance is it).  Too many steps to find the patient balance, why is it not on the first patient screen.  Also, copay, have to add an extra step in to find copay for insurance unless the patient has a card.  Difficult to figure out what needs to be fixed on denials.  No place to put the reason the patient is coming in that will cross over.  So an "office visit" for any reason, we make a note and then have our staff print that day's appointments - or flip between systems.  I have over 30 years experience, the sixth system I have been on, and I am NOT happy.

Clean claims




Pros
Easy to navigate and customer service is professional and helpful.  Claim rejections are informative as far as what is needed by the payer and enrollment assistance is easy to access.   Claim scrubbing can be done for each new patient which creates smooth billing for ongoing claims.




Cons
Not enough variety for report options and the custom report option is too complicated.  Billing secondary claims can be perplexing trying to attach the primary remit information to the claim.  The sort method for some of the screens could have more options.

It covers all the aspects we need to keep record and track of claims 




Pros
Change is always hard at first, and at first I was not happy. When things are made easier for you and you can not tell; you rebel. I was wrong...the more I used Kareo the more I found it to be so helpful in running a small medical office.

Keeping track of charges, billing, claim transmission, and statements all made easy




Cons
The Cons are not as negative as other issues. The program shuts down when an error occurs; yet nothing is ever loss.

An electronic health record system that works but even in itself has too many shortcomings for taste. 




Pros
This software provides beatiful EHR templates for charting. You can also create your own specified templates but the pre-made ones suffice. Along with that the scheduling in the EHR is easy to use and you can create a patient if they aren't in the database and you need to schedule a new patient.




Cons
Customer service is one of the worst providing customer service I have experienced. Dedicated members of managed billing, enrollments, and marketing don't even communicate efficiently. They also have you do their job at times when they have the resources at hand to figure things out yourself. You'll spend more time trying to get the certified medical biller and coder to do their job than taking care of patients.

None, tried to cancel immediately, but even that took months.




Pros
They provided a very extensive tutorial, which is needed considering how complicated the process was.




Cons
Poor customer service, they would not refund money after they placed me into wrong subscription category.
The process of submitting a claim took about 4 times as long as it did with a free system I had been using.
They continued to charge my bank account for 2 months after I cancelled and did not offer a refund.

As a start-up and not being able to open for several months, having your arm twisted to purchase an PM/EMR/Billing solution is not being considerate on the part of Kareo.  A start up has many things to do and many things to invest in without wasting money on a system that will not be used due to time constraints. We paid from our limited resources for nothing for a couple of months.  Even after canceling they are still trying to bill us.  I consider them to be insensitive to the needs of a start-up and would not recommend them.  They have a good sales pitch but my trust level was completely destroyed and I switched to another company.




Pros
It has a marketing solution




Cons
It does not create an automatic narrative attached to ICD10 codes as you click on options.




Advice to Others
Start-ups with limited resources should not be pressured into buying any software until they know that other priorities are out of the way.  Otherwise they will pay for something they will not be using for a couple of months.

KAREO IS HORRIBLE!!! They're customer service is rude. They're account representatives are illiterate. 

They do not know how to bill for services. We tried Kareo for a time. They sent out invoices to people who never should have been billed and for the people who were supposed to be billed they never sent an invoice. They're expensive for extremely poor work. We could not wait to get away from this company and now they're denying us access to our old notes. We often receive requests from lawyers, insurance companies, other physicians for our patients notes, but Kareo will no longer allow us access to the old notes unless we pay...

It's clear to me that this company is in trouble if they have to insist on payment to access old notes that the doctor documented on his patients. We are now looking into litigation and we will sue for our records. This company WITHOUT QUESTION and most assuredly is destined for failure. IT's inevitable. AGAIN IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT USING THIS SERVICE, KAREO, FOR ANY OF YOUR MEDICAL OFFICE NEEDS I IMPLORE YOU TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. THIS COMPANY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT MEDICAL BILLING, SCHEDULING AND THEY REALLY, REALLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT DECENT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. ALL THIS COMPANY CARES ABOUT IS $$$$$$$$$.......TAKE IT FROM ONE WHO KNOWS...MOST INCOMPETENT.




Pros
Nothing...it is not user friendly




Cons
Customer service is rude. Customer billing representatives are incompetent. 




Advice to Others
FIND ANOTHER BILLING SOFTWARE COMPANY...KAREO IS ON ITS WAY OUT....

We are a small practice, and handling the office management, administration and billing was taking too much time and manpower to address. The Kareo Practice Management app allows me to stay on top of issues and keep my practice running well. Their billing team is excellent and we have a dedicated team leader from Kareo (Tanya) who is outstanding. They have kept my A/R aging under control and have really helped me deal with the many hurdles you can face with insurance companies. I have been able to use my time on running and growing our business and have been able to focus our small office staff on customer service and revenue generating activities.Strongly recommend you check Kareo out.




Pros
The support is excellent and you can always get a live voice to discuss issues and develop solutions.




Cons
Would like to see the cost come down a bit.

I had to cancel due to inability of Kareo to integrate with Practice Fusion.   Despite advertising they could, they were unable to do so after multiple hours with technical support and two months trying.  It was - Practice Fusion saying it was Kareo, Kareo saying it was Practice Fusion.  I was very surprised having seen Kareo's reviews.  When I asked for a refund, I received a firm, "no" and the reply below.   I didn't read their extensive contract, which in fact states, if they can't get it to work, it is not their responsibility.  I switched companies and was up an running in two weeks.

From Kareo, "Please keep in mind that Kareo subscription fees are not contingent on your ability to successfully integrate with your third party EHR"

Red flag went up when they wanted my credit card information before I was able to use the free 3 month demo version.  Well I was busy setting up a new practice that I moved into December 1st and never used the software.  I emailed them 8 days after the 3 month demo expired which was December 4th and that I wouldn't be able to afford the EHR just yet and to check back in February.  No response from Steve Cohen the sales guy.  But on January 10th I don't just get a bill but they automatically withdrew over $800 from my account for a service I never used.  I call and left a voicemail, then I emailed Steve Cohen, no response back from either yesterday.  I call again and the guy puts me on hold at least 4 times and his response is, "Well we tried to call you several times."   I understand I went past the deadline so I was willing to pay for the 6 business days of use after the demo was over but that was over $500.  And then I got hung up on.  I guess I know why they get your credit card info.  If you don't want the software they can find some way to charge you anyway!!!




Pros
great options, would have done what i needed for manual therapy




Cons
Too costly and too many features for what i do.




Advice to Others
don't demo it.

I really enjoy using Kareo for our PT clinic.  It is so easy to use!  I really enjoy the check code feature it has.




Pros
Ease of use, reporting, and code check




Cons
It's missing some reports I would like to have and I would like a few more filter options on some of the reports

I like the Kareo billing platform and the Kareo EMR when using them together. It is kind of frustrating that I have to flip back and forth between the facesheet and account to view the insurance when doing prior authorizations. I also wish the patient's insurance information was more readily available to see. However, past due balances and copays are easier to track. Kareo EMR is also super nice because it will tell you if a patient's insurance is active or not. 




Pros
That Kareo EMR and the billing plateform are super compatible with each other




Cons
That the patient charts are not more efficient.

I have been using Kareo for 2 years now and I love it.  I only use it as my billing software, but I wouldn't change it for another.  I love the ease of use and the cost.




Pros
I really like the ease of use, and the cost.




Cons
Some of the reports could use some more filters.




Advice to Others
For the cost, you get a great software!

Pros
Not much. The orange guy logo? That about sums up my likes. I have nothing nice or positive to contribute.




Cons
Kareo is outdated and difficult to navigate compared to other available software. It lacks functionality and intuition, completely incapable of anticipating the needs of its user. The ability to sort through super bills is RIDICULOUSLY inefficient. (I have many examples of poor software design, that is making my life hell.) 

The soft ware has so many "An unexpected error has occurred" alerts that prevents me from entering the patient chart and no one on the support team ever knows how to fix it. I was unable to view my patient charts for 7 days with NO SOLUTION from program designers. There is a significant lack of accountability for their shortcomings which needs to be addressed urgently. I am getting further and further behind in my documentation because this error message prevents me from viewing notes at all. I have been told 2x now that a supervisor will call me back. NO ONE ever does. It was fixed very briefly last week, but here I am again... 

MASSIVE improvements to expand the functionality are needed. Kareo is not a big player in our market, and likely never will be if big changes are not made. Immediate attempts to find SOME tools that will drive efficiency are critical.  This EHR software is NOT designed to save medical organizations time and effort in processing patient information, as much as they may think it does.

We are switching from clinicsource to Kareo and so far we are loving the extra features we get - text/email alert for patients, ease of site navigation, multifunctionality and I absolutely love all the reports and tracking systems. I can't wait to see where are earning and losing money!




Cons
The only issue I keep hitting is the template system. I understand why it is as complicated as it is but I would love an even more comprehensive guide on how to create templates from scratch AND any templates related to speech therapy would be nice. There are ZERO at this time.

There is a lot of click here and click there to get anywhere, which I believe this software should be easier to use than the older software that we had, but it is not.  takes more time to do anything.  There is no discharge feature.  I wish customer service would be more helpful.  




Pros
Very inexpensive, easy set up.  Getting clearance from the insurances to switch over to the new clearing house was a piece of cake.  




Cons
customer service is hard to get once they think your all set.  So now I am trying to train myself.  UGH!!!!

Kareo is similar to PracticeFusion except they now charge a few for the EHR.  If the company had made changes in the operating platform to keep it modern like other programs on the market it would be great, not all programs have iPad apps; otherwise it's a waste of money and would recommend picking something different.




Pros
Familiar with software and functions.
Easy to use and maneuver.
Web-based and compatible with MAC.
iPad application available for tablet users.




Cons
Rates are fairly comparable with other EHR systems, however Kareo does not often the functions that are available on most EHRs.
Not compatible with all specialties.
Support is hit and miss.

Pros
Very easy to learn how to use on your own.  Other than that, it is not the easiest program to use for behavioral health.




Cons
Very slow and cumbersome and not user-friendly for counselors
1  Cannot enter groups all at once (having a preloaded listing of clients and enter a visit in and have it populate automatically in all their charts)
2  No treatment planning option at all; other programs have treatment plans that ties notes and counselors to specific treatment plans (cannot update them electronically); 
3  Even when you choose more than  10 clients per page, you still have to scroll down; window does not fit screen; if you get out of it, it defaults back to 10 clients; slows down progress
4  You should be able to print all notes out for client at one time

I have worked at both the state and federal level and while their systems were much more in-depth, they were more user-friendly and ease of navigation.

For a small practice, this is one of the. Ost cost effective programs I have seen. 




Pros
Progress note generates the billing. 
Professional reports, professional looking statements
Can add timed codes for medicare patients so you can avoid a billing error.
Can fax evaluation dirctly to MD upom creation
. 




Cons
Cannot have two "user windows" open at once without paying additional money for 2 PTs. For example, I would like to be able to document on my ipad while in a room with a patient, and then comp,ete the note on my PC in my main gym area. I have to exit out,then sign back in on a different device, taking 4 steps instead of 2. Doesnt sound like much, but adds up to a lot of time over the course of a day.
Many of the features have additional rcurring fees. (Schedule, outcomes,)

Not all fields are customizable. You can add "smart text" for frequently used phrases, but this option is not available on every field.
For example, cannot add smart text to the Plan, or to Assessment.  Have asked many times if could be added, but it has never been put in update.

After spending about 10-15 hours learning Kareo and starting to develop templates, I threw in the towel and canceled it.  Thank goodness I was on a free 30-day trial period.  The straw that broke the camel's back was not being able to schedule non-patient appointments and being told my request would not be dealt with by the engineers in the near future.  They have their "roadmap" set for the next few months already and take customer input on a quarterly basis.  




Pros
When I asked to speak to a manager, I got someone who was professional, nice, and apologetic for some problems I ran into.  The "success training coach" was very friendly and genuinely seemed like he wanted to help and accommodate any request.




Cons
The sales rep did not communicate to the "success training coach" what I needed to have my EHR configured.  We wasted hours on the phone trying to figure it out.  Had she just communicated my needs to him ahead of time, he could have solved the issues behind the scenes, instead of having me lose a few hours of valuable time.  After all of that, when I started using the system, I discovered you cannot book a non-patient appointment!!!  The system does not allow you to schedule meetings or non-patient related phone calls!

Admittedly, we're still new, but we've been very pleased with the support we've been able to find through the help desk and the Facebook groups.  We've encountered a number of practices who have already worked out many of the issues we've encountered and have taught us a lot in the process.  We really like our success coach, and he's gone out of his way to help me work through some of the particular things my clients want.




Pros
It's easy to use, and cost-effective for us.




Cons
We wish they had a collections module.  Right now it's a VERY manual process.

I have been using kareo for more than 5 years. Lately the waiting time to talk to a customer service rep is too long.
most of the time we don't get the answer and will say we will get a call back. we never get a call back .
If we ask for help with EHR and templates most of the time they don't have the answer.
Also we have to pay for training session other than the initial session




Pros
Nothing at this time




Cons
frustrating

I am currently using this EHR because my billing company recommended it since they use the Kareo practice management. It has been a nightmare for me having used a much better EHR - Athena. The onboarding process was a disaster and after 3 months, the lab integration has not been completed with labcorp and there is no follow-ups. I have to initiate every contact with my coach who should be reaching out to me to make sure that my transition to kareo is seamless. 

There is no integration with Imaging centers so you have to order the tests and then manually fax to the imaging center unlike Athena. 

When it comes to labs, you cannot find some of them like a common FIT test to screen for colon cancer.

How about e-prescribing? Forget about prescribing common diabetes supplies like test strips, lancet or OTC medications, they are not there. With Athena, once you start typing the name of the supply you need, it pulls everything up and you can transmit those to the pharmacy electronically. For those you now want to fax to the pharmacy manually, the pharmacy name, phone or fax # does not even show on the prescription so you have to go back to the patient's chart and go to somewhere in the demographics to find the fax # and then write it down or memorize before faxing.

When you place a referral, you cannot attach documents such as labs, radiology reports  to the referral before efaxing. What is the point efaxing just a referral and then printing out other relevant records that should accompany the referral to manually fax....so dumb.

How about releasing a patient result to their portal, you are not able to comment on the results that you are releasing to the patient. You have to send a different message to the patient after you have already released the results. Now, I keeping getting an error sending a message to patients through the portal using Google chrome browser and Firefox with different computers  and they don't have any clue what is going on. I can't get any help with the technical support or my coach. They created a case and that's it. I guess I need to be calling them and taking time from caring for the patients to be doing that before I can resolve any issues.




Pros
Frankly, I do not see any




Cons
Everything

I cannot honestly say that has given up much benefit = perhaps more options for reports.




Pros
lots of options in reports, but not easy to figure out.  colors of screens are easy on the eyes.  no other good comments.




Cons
Poor training.  poor customer service.  errors that I do not get answers on.  Does not pull in appointment code & ending date of service, using Care360 for EMR.  Pulling up info - not enough info shows.  No place to make recommendations (like when pulling up the list of "encounters", which insurance is it).  Too many steps to find the patient balance, why is it not on the first patient screen.  Also, copay, have to add an extra step in to find copay for insurance unless the patient has a card.  Difficult to figure out what needs to be fixed on denials.  No place to put the reason the patient is coming in that will cross over.  So an "office visit" for any reason, we make a note and then have our staff print that day's appointments - or flip between systems.  I have over 30 years experience, the sixth system I have been on, and I am NOT happy.

Clean claims




Pros
Easy to navigate and customer service is professional and helpful.  Claim rejections are informative as far as what is needed by the payer and enrollment assistance is easy to access.   Claim scrubbing can be done for each new patient which creates smooth billing for ongoing claims.




Cons
Not enough variety for report options and the custom report option is too complicated.  Billing secondary claims can be perplexing trying to attach the primary remit information to the claim.  The sort method for some of the screens could have more options.

It covers all the aspects we need to keep record and track of claims 




Pros
Change is always hard at first, and at first I was not happy. When things are made easier for you and you can not tell; you rebel. I was wrong...the more I used Kareo the more I found it to be so helpful in running a small medical office.

Keeping track of charges, billing, claim transmission, and statements all made easy




Cons
The Cons are not as negative as other issues. The program shuts down when an error occurs; yet nothing is ever loss.

An electronic health record system that works but even in itself has too many shortcomings for taste. 




Pros
This software provides beatiful EHR templates for charting. You can also create your own specified templates but the pre-made ones suffice. Along with that the scheduling in the EHR is easy to use and you can create a patient if they aren't in the database and you need to schedule a new patient.




Cons
Customer service is one of the worst providing customer service I have experienced. Dedicated members of managed billing, enrollments, and marketing don't even communicate efficiently. They also have you do their job at times when they have the resources at hand to figure things out yourself. You'll spend more time trying to get the certified medical biller and coder to do their job than taking care of patients.

None, tried to cancel immediately, but even that took months.




Pros
They provided a very extensive tutorial, which is needed considering how complicated the process was.




Cons
Poor customer service, they would not refund money after they placed me into wrong subscription category.
The process of submitting a claim took about 4 times as long as it did with a free system I had been using.
They continued to charge my bank account for 2 months after I cancelled and did not offer a refund.

Pros
Ease of use once you get accustomed to the location of the features.  On-boarding and training are easy.  They help you through setting up all the clearinghouses and getting your EFTs and ERAs. 




Cons
There are some reports that would be nice to have and reports tend to be more complicated than they need to be.

As a start-up and not being able to open for several months, having your arm twisted to purchase an PM/EMR/Billing solution is not being considerate on the part of Kareo.  A start up has many things to do and many things to invest in without wasting money on a system that will not be used due to time constraints. We paid from our limited resources for nothing for a couple of months.  Even after canceling they are still trying to bill us.  I consider them to be insensitive to the needs of a start-up and would not recommend them.  They have a good sales pitch but my trust level was completely destroyed and I switched to another company.




Pros
It has a marketing solution




Cons
It does not create an automatic narrative attached to ICD10 codes as you click on options.




Advice to Others
Start-ups with limited resources should not be pressured into buying any software until they know that other priorities are out of the way.  Otherwise they will pay for something they will not be using for a couple of months.

Kareo has been a great billing software that we have been using for a little over a year now. We have been able to keep track of our a/r with all of the great reports that are available to us. We are overall satisfied with kareo. 




Pros

Cons
Collections accounts could be easier to differentiate with a highlight on the account. 




Advice to Others
This software is very easy to use and if you have any questions you can call customer service who has always been extremely helpful.

KAREO IS HORRIBLE!!! They're customer service is rude. They're account representatives are illiterate. 

They do not know how to bill for services. We tried Kareo for a time. They sent out invoices to people who never should have been billed and for the people who were supposed to be billed they never sent an invoice. They're expensive for extremely poor work. We could not wait to get away from this company and now they're denying us access to our old notes. We often receive requests from lawyers, insurance companies, other physicians for our patients notes, but Kareo will no longer allow us access to the old notes unless we pay...

It's clear to me that this company is in trouble if they have to insist on payment to access old notes that the doctor documented on his patients. We are now looking into litigation and we will sue for our records. This company WITHOUT QUESTION and most assuredly is destined for failure. IT's inevitable. AGAIN IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT USING THIS SERVICE, KAREO, FOR ANY OF YOUR MEDICAL OFFICE NEEDS I IMPLORE YOU TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. THIS COMPANY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT MEDICAL BILLING, SCHEDULING AND THEY REALLY, REALLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT DECENT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. ALL THIS COMPANY CARES ABOUT IS $$$$$$$$$.......TAKE IT FROM ONE WHO KNOWS...MOST INCOMPETENT.




Pros
Nothing...it is not user friendly




Cons
Customer service is rude. Customer billing representatives are incompetent. 




Advice to Others
FIND ANOTHER BILLING SOFTWARE COMPANY...KAREO IS ON ITS WAY OUT....

We are a small practice, and handling the office management, administration and billing was taking too much time and manpower to address. The Kareo Practice Management app allows me to stay on top of issues and keep my practice running well. Their billing team is excellent and we have a dedicated team leader from Kareo (Tanya) who is outstanding. They have kept my A/R aging under control and have really helped me deal with the many hurdles you can face with insurance companies. I have been able to use my time on running and growing our business and have been able to focus our small office staff on customer service and revenue generating activities.Strongly recommend you check Kareo out.




Pros
The support is excellent and you can always get a live voice to discuss issues and develop solutions.




Cons
Would like to see the cost come down a bit.

I had to cancel due to inability of Kareo to integrate with Practice Fusion.   Despite advertising they could, they were unable to do so after multiple hours with technical support and two months trying.  It was - Practice Fusion saying it was Kareo, Kareo saying it was Practice Fusion.  I was very surprised having seen Kareo's reviews.  When I asked for a refund, I received a firm, "no" and the reply below.   I didn't read their extensive contract, which in fact states, if they can't get it to work, it is not their responsibility.  I switched companies and was up an running in two weeks.

From Kareo, "Please keep in mind that Kareo subscription fees are not contingent on your ability to successfully integrate with your third party EHR"

Red flag went up when they wanted my credit card information before I was able to use the free 3 month demo version.  Well I was busy setting up a new practice that I moved into December 1st and never used the software.  I emailed them 8 days after the 3 month demo expired which was December 4th and that I wouldn't be able to afford the EHR just yet and to check back in February.  No response from Steve Cohen the sales guy.  But on January 10th I don't just get a bill but they automatically withdrew over $800 from my account for a service I never used.  I call and left a voicemail, then I emailed Steve Cohen, no response back from either yesterday.  I call again and the guy puts me on hold at least 4 times and his response is, "Well we tried to call you several times."   I understand I went past the deadline so I was willing to pay for the 6 business days of use after the demo was over but that was over $500.  And then I got hung up on.  I guess I know why they get your credit card info.  If you don't want the software they can find some way to charge you anyway!!!




Pros
great options, would have done what i needed for manual therapy




Cons
Too costly and too many features for what i do.

I like the Kareo billing platform and the Kareo EMR when using them together. It is kind of frustrating that I have to flip back and forth between the facesheet and account to view the insurance when doing prior authorizations. I also wish the patient's insurance information was more readily available to see. However, past due balances and copays are easier to track. Kareo EMR is also super nice because it will tell you if a patient's insurance is active or not. 




Pros
That Kareo EMR and the billing plateform are super compatible with each other




Cons
That the patient charts are not more efficient.

With a patient population that is in perpetual motion—both on the playing field and off—the USOC's medical information needs are among the most demanding imaginable. On any given day, Olympic athletes are spread all around the world, training, conditioning, competing, and, occasionally, getting injured or falling ill. When that happens, effective treatment and fast recovery can mean the difference between silver and gold.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

                        BuyerZone.com, LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 6 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
