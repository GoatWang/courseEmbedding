to such amounts, shall have a claim
for the unpaid portion of such amount and
shall share pari passu with
Certificateholders to the extent of such
claim in the proceeds from the sale
or recovery of the Underlying Securities.
The Trustor hereby instructs the
Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of
the Trust to enter into and
execute the Swap Agreement and perform the
obligations thereunder on behalf of
the Trust, including, but not limited to,
receiving and returning any
collateral posted by the Swap Counterparty
in accordance with the Swap
Agreement.
 
                 
(c) The Trustee hereby (i) acknowledges such sale, deposit
and delivery, pursuant to subsection (b)
above, and receipt by it of the
Underlying Securities, (ii) acknowledges
receipt of the duly authorized and
executed Swap Agreement, (iii) accepts the
trusts created hereunder in
accordance with the provisions hereof and
of the Base Trust Agreement but
subject to the Trustee's obligation, as and
when the same may arise, to make
any payment or other distribution of the
assets of the Trust as may be
required pursuant to this Series
Supplement, the Base Trust Agreement, the
Certificates and the Swap Agreement, and
(iv) agrees to perform the duties
herein or therein required and any failure
to receive reimbursement of
expenses and disbursements under Section 13
hereof shall not release the
Trustee from its duties herein or
therein.
 
                 
Section 3. Designation. There is hereby created a Series of
trust certificates to be issued pursuant to
the Base Trust Agreement and this
Series Supplement to be known as the
"STRATS(SM) Certificates, Series 2005-3".
The Certificates shall have the terms
provided for in this Series Supplement.
The Certificates shall be issued in the
amount set forth in Section 5 and with
the additional terms set forth in Exhibit B
to this Series Supplement. The
Certificates shall be issued in
substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C
to this Series Supplement with such
necessary or appropriate changes as shall
be approved by the Trustor and the Trustee,
such approval to be manifested by
the execution and authentication thereof by
the Trustee. The Certificates
shall evidence undivided ownership
interests in the assets of the Trust,
subject to the liabilities of the Trust and
shall be payable solely from
payments or property received by the
Trustee on or in respect of the
Underlying Securities and the Swap
Agreement.

Section 4. Date of the Certificates. The Certificates that
are authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee to or upon Trustor Order on the
Closing Date shall be dated the Closing
Date. All other Certificates that are
authenticated after the Closing Date for
any other purpose under the Agreement
shall be dated the date of their
authentication.
 
                 
Section 5. Certificate Stated Amount and Denominations. On
the Closing Date, up to 40,000 Certificates
with an aggregate Stated Amount of
$40,000,000 may be authenticated and
delivered under the Base Trust Agreement
and this Series Supplement. The Stated
Amount of the Certificates shall equal
100% of the initial principal amount of
Underlying Securities sold to the
Trustee and deposited in the Trust. Such
Stated Amount shall be calculated
without regard to Certificates
authenticated and delivered upon registration
of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in
lieu of, other Certificates pursuant
to Sections 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5 of the Base
Trust Agreement.
 
                 
Section 6. Currency of the Certificates. All distributions
on the Certificates will be made in the
Specified Currency.
 
                 
Section 7. Form of Securities. The Trustee shall execute and
deliver the Certificates in the form of one
or more global certificates
registered in the name of the Depositary or
its nominee.
 
                 
Section 8. Swap Payments; Collateral Account. (a) The Trust
shall pay to the Swap Counterparty (i) for
so long as the Swap Agreement shall
not have been terminated, except during a
Deferral Period, an amount equal to
all interest payments received by the Trust
in respect of the Underlying
Securities on each Underlying Securities
Payment Date, excluding any amount of
interest that accrued with respect to the
Underlying Securities from the
Underlying Securities Payment Date
immediately preceding the Closing Date to,
but excluding, the Closing Date and (ii)
all other amounts owing to the Swap
Counterparty under the Swap Agreement to
the extent Trust assets are
sufficient therefor, including but not
limited to all Unpaid Amounts upon the
occurrence of any Swap Agreement
Termination Event.
 
                 
(b) In the event that any payment with respect to the
Underlying Securities is not received by
the Trustee by 12 noon (New York City
time) on an Underlying Securities Payment
Date as a result of any Deferral
Period, the Trustee shall not make any
payment to the Swap Counterparty on
such Underlying Securities Payment Date. If
any payment with respect to the
Underlying Securities is made to the
Trustee after an Underlying Securities
Payment Date on which such payment was due,
the Trustee shall promptly
distribute such amount received to the Swap
Counterparty on any date the
Trustee receives such payment, or as soon
as practicable thereafter.
 
                 
(c) The Trustee shall within 3 Business Days of the Closing
Date establish the Collateral Account. Any
and all amounts at any time on
deposit in the Collateral Account shall be
held in trust by the Trustee for
the benefit of Certificateholders and the
Swap Counterparty; provided, that,
the only permitted withdrawal from or
application of funds on deposit in, or
otherwise to the credit of, the Collateral
Account shall be (i) for
application to obligations of the Swap
Counterparty to the Trust under the
Swap Agreement in accordance with the terms
of the Swap Agreement or (ii) to
return Posted Collateral to the Swap
Counterparty when and as
 
 
                                     
7
<PAGE>
 
required by the Swap Agreement, which the
Trustee shall return to the Swap
Counterparty in accordance with the related
Swap Agreement.
 
                 
Section 9. Certain Provisions of Base Trust Agreement Not
Applicable. The provisions of Sections
5.11, 5.16, 6.2, Article VII, 8.1, 8.2
and 8.10 of the Base Trust Agreement and
any other provision of the Base Trust
Agreement which imposes obligations on or
creates rights in favor of the
Trustee or the Certificateholders as a
result of or in connection with an
"Event of Default" or "Administrative Agent
Termination Event" shall be
inapplicable with respect to the
Certificates. In addition, there is no
"Administrative Agent" specified herein,
and all references to "Administrative
Agent" in the Base Trust Agreement,
therefore shall be inapplicable with
respect to the Certificates.
 
                 
Section 10. Distributions. (a) On each Distribution Date,
except during any Deferral Period during
which no distributions to
Certificateholders shall be made, so long
as no Swap Agreement Termination
Event has occurred for which the Trust is
the Defaulting Party or an Affected
Party, the Trustee shall distribute to the
Certificateholders the Interest
Collections. On the Maturity Date, and to
the extent received on any other
Scheduled Distribution Date or any
Underlying Securities Redemption
Distribution Date, so long as no Swap
Agreement Termination Event has occurred
for which the Trust is the Defaulting Party
or an Affected Party, the Trustee
shall distribute to the Certificateholders,
the principal amount of the
Underlying Securities to the extent the
principal of the Underlying Securities
is received by the Trustee on such date or
during the related Collection
Period plus any accrued interest
thereon.
 
                 
(b) If a Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred for
which the Trust is the Defaulting Party or
an Affected Party, the Trustee,
first, shall distribute all collections
received on the Underlying Securities
to the Swap Counterparty until all amounts
owing to the Swap Counterparty
under the Swap Agreement for payments in
connection with such Swap Agreement
Termination Event (including any Unpaid
Amounts) have been paid in full and,
second, shall distribute all remaining
amounts to the Certificateholders. If
the distribution in the preceding sentence
is insufficient to pay in full all
amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty, the
Trustee shall proceed to liquidate
or distribute the Underlying Securities in
accordance with Section 10(i). Upon
any liquidation of the Underlying
Securities, the Trustee, first, shall
distribute the proceeds thereof to the Swap
Counterparty until all amounts
owing to the Swap Counterparty have been
paid in full and, second, shall
distribute all remaining amounts to the
Certificateholders. In the event of a
Swap Agreement Termination Event, after
paying all amounts due to the Swap
Counterparty as set forth in the first
sentence of this Section 10(b), if no
Trust Termination Event has occurred, all
Interest Collections shall
thereafter be distributed to
Certificateholders on each applicable
Distribution Date. If a Swap Agreement
Termination Event has occurred for
which the Swap Counterparty is the
Defaulting Party or the only Affected
Party, notwithstanding the termination of
the Swap Agreement, the Trustee
shall distribute any Unpaid Amounts to the
Swap Counterparty from Interest
Collections on the Underlying
Securities.
 
                 
(c) In all cases hereunder, except as provided in
subsections 8(b) and 10(d) hereof, if any
payment with respect to the
Underlying Securities is made to the
Trustee after the Underlying Securities
Payment Date on which such payment was due,
the Trustee shall distribute such
amount received on the Business Day
following such receipt.
 
 
 
                                     
8
<PAGE>
 
                 
(d) Upon the occurrence of any Deferral Period (i) the
Trustee shall not be obligated to
distribute Interest Collections on any
Scheduled Distribution Date until (x)
payments on the Underlying Securities
have resumed and (y) all amounts due and
payable on the Underlying Securities
have been received by the Trust and any
amounts owed to the Swap Counterparty
under the Swap Agreement have been paid to
the Swap Counterparty. Upon the
satisfaction of these conditions, the
Trustee shall distribute the Interest
Collections to Certificateholders in
accordance with subsection 10(a) above.
 
                 
(e) In the event of a Payment Default while the Swap
Agreement is in effect and if any payment
is due to the Swap Counterparty, the
Underlying Securities will be liquidated in
accordance with Section 10(i).
Otherwise, in the event of a Payment
Default, the Trustee shall proceed
against the Underlying Securities Issuer on
behalf of the Certificateholders
to enforce the Underlying Securities or
otherwise to protect the interests of
the Certificateholders, subject to the
receipt of indemnity in form and
substance satisfactory to the Trustee;
provided, that Holders of the
Certificates representing a majority of the
Voting Rights on the Certificates
will be entitled to direct the Trustee in
any such proceeding or direct the
Trustee to sell the Underlying Securities,
subject to the Trustee's receipt of
satisfactory indemnity.
 
                 
(f) In the event of an Acceleration and a corresponding
payment on the Underlying Securities prior
to any liquidation of the
Underlying Securities hereunder, the
Trustee shall distribute the proceeds to
the Certificateholders no later than two
(2) Business Days after the receipt
of immediately available funds pursuant to
Section 10(b).
 
                 
(g) In the event the Trustee receives property other than
cash in respect of the Underlying
Securities such property will be applied
first, to the Swap Counterparty until all
amounts owing to the Swap
Counterparty have been paid in full and,
second, to the Certificateholders.
Property other than cash will be liquidated
by the Trustee, and the proceeds
thereof distributed in cash, to the extent
necessary to pay to the Swap
Counterparty all amounts owed to it under
the Swap Agreement and, thereafter,
to the extent necessary to avoid
distribution of fractional securities to
Certificateholders. In-kind distribution of
Underlying Securities or other
property to Certificateholders will be
deemed to reduce the Stated Amount of
Certificates on a proportionate basis.
Following such in-kind distribution,
all Certificates will be cancelled. No
amounts will be distributed to the
Trustor in respect of the Underlying
Securities. The Swap Counterparty shall
direct the Trustee with respect to any
liquidation of such property to the
extent of the full amount owed to it under
the Swap Agreement.
 
                 
(h) If an SEC Reporting Failure occurs, then the Trustor
shall promptly notify the Trustee, the Swap
Counterparty and the Rating Agency
of such SEC Reporting Failure and the
Trustee shall, only if instructed by the
Trustor, proceed to liquidate or distribute
the Underlying Securities in
accordance with Section 10(i).
 
                 
(i) If at any time, the Trustee is directed to sell the
Underlying Securities, the Trustee shall
solicit bids for the sale of the
Underlying Securities with settlement
thereof on or before the third (3rd)
Business Day after such sale from three
leading dealers in the relevant
market, which may include but is not
limited to any three of the following
dealers: (1) Wachovia Securities, (2)
Goldman, Sachs & Co., (3) Lehman
Brothers Inc., (4) Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated, (5)
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., (6) J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc.
 
 
                                     
9
<PAGE>
 
and (7) Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.;
provided, however, that no bid from
Wachovia Securities or any affiliate
thereof shall be accepted unless such bid
equals the then fair market value of such
Underlying Securities. The Trustee
shall not be responsible for the failure to
obtain a bid so long as it has
made reasonable efforts to obtain bids. If
a bid for the sale of the
Underlying Securities has been accepted by
the Trustee but the sale has failed
to settle on the proposed settlement date,
the Trustee shall request new bids
from such leading dealers. In any
circumstance in which the sale of the
Underlying Securities is required
hereunder, the Trustee shall, to the extent
it is so directed by the Trustor, provide
Certificateholders with the option
to elect to receive an "in-kind"
distribution of their pro rata share of the
Underlying Securities; provided, that, (1)
an in-kind distribution shall be
subject to the prior sale of Underlying
Securities in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 10(i) to the
extent necessary, to pay any amounts
owing to the Swap Counterparty under
Section 10(b), (2) a Certificateholders'
pro rata share of the Underlying Securities
shall be a principal amount of
Underlying Securities equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the
Underlying Securities minus the amount
required to be distributed to the Swap
Counterparty pursuant to the second
sentence of Section 10(b) multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the
Stated Amount of that holder's
Certificates and the denominator of which
is the aggregate principal amount of
the Underlying Securities and (3) odd-lot
amounts that cannot be distributed
in-kind because they are not within the
authorized denominations of the
Underlying Securities shall be distributed
in cash. Any such in-kind
distribution shall constitute the final
distribution in respect of the
Certificates as to which such option is
exercised.
 
                 
(j) Distributions to the Certificateholders on each
Distribution Date will be made to the
Certificateholders of record on the
Record Date.
 
                 
(k) All distributions to Certificateholders shall be
allocated pro rata among the Certificates
based on their respective
Outstanding Amounts as of the Record
Date.
 
                 
(l) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent funds are
available, the Trustee will initiate payment
in immediately available funds by 1:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on each
Distribution Date of all amounts payable to
each Certificateholder with
respect to any Certificate held by such
Certificateholder or its nominee
(without the necessity for any presentation
or surrender thereof or any
notation of such payment thereon) in the
manner and at the address as each
Certificateholder may from time to time
direct the Trustee in writing 15 days
prior to such Distribution Date requesting
that such payment will be so made
and designating the bank account to which
such payments shall be so made. The
Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the
last instruction delivered by the
Certificateholder pursuant to this Section
10(g) unless a new instruction is
delivered 15 days prior to a Distribution
Date.
 
                 
(m) The rights of the Certificateholders to receive
distributions in respect of the
Certificates, and all interests of the
Certificateholders in such distributions,
shall be as set forth in this Series
Supplement. The Trustee shall in no way be
responsible or liable to the
Certificateholders nor shall any
Certificateholder in any way be responsible
or liable to any other Certificateholder in
respect of amounts previously
distributed on the Certificates based on
their respective Outstanding Amounts.
 
                 
Section 11. Termination of Trust. (a) The Trust shall
terminate upon the occurrence of any Trust
Termination Event.
 
 
 
                                     
10
<PAGE>
 
                 
(b) Except for any reports and other information required
to be provided to Certificateholders
hereunder and under the Base Trust
Agreement and except as otherwise specified
herein and therein, the
obligations of the Trustee will terminate
upon the distribution to the Swap
Counterparty and Certificateholders of all
amounts required to be distributed
to them and the disposition of all
Underlying Securities held by the Trustee.
The Trust shall thereupon terminate, except
for surviving rights of indemnity.
 
                 
Section 12. Limitation of Powers and Duties. (a) The Trustee
shall administer the Trust and the
Underlying Securities solely as specified
herein and in the Base Trust Agreement.
 
                 
(b) The Trust is constituted solely for the purpose of
acquiring and holding the Underlying
Securities, entering into and performing
its obligations under the Swap Agreement
and issuing the Certificates. The
Trustee is not authorized to acquire any
other investments or engage in any
activities not authorized herein and, in
particular, unless expressly provided
in the Agreement, the Trustee is not
authorized (i) to sell, assign, transfer,
exchange, pledge, set-off or otherwise
dispose of any of the Underlying
Securities, once acquired, or interests
therein, including to
Certificateholders, (ii) to merge or
consolidate the Trust with any other
entity, or (iii) to do anything that would
materially increase the likelihood
that the Trust will fail to qualify as a
grantor trust for United States
federal income tax purposes. In addition,
the Trustee has no power to create,
assume or incur indebtedness or other
liabilities in the name of the Trust
other than as contemplated herein and in
the Base Trust Agreement.
 
                
  (c) The parties
acknowledge that the Trustee, as the holder
of the Underlying Securities, has the right
to vote and give consents and
waivers in respect of the Underlying
Securities and enforce the other rights,
if any, of a holder of the Underlying
Securities, except as otherwise limited
by the Base Trust Agreement or this Series
Supplement. In the event that the
Trustee receives a request from the
Underlying Securities Trustee, the
Underlying Securities Issuer, the
Underlying Securities Guarantor or, if
applicable, the Depositary with respect to
the Underlying Securities, for the
Trustee's consent to any amendment,
modification or waiver of the Underlying
Securities, or any document relating
thereto, or receives any other
solicitation for any action with respect to
the Underlying Securities, the
Trustee shall within two (2) Business Days
mail a notice of such proposed
amendment, modification, waiver or
solicitation to the Swap Counterparty and
each Certificateholder of record as of the
date of such request. The Trustee
shall request instructions from the
Certificateholders as to what action to
take in response to such request and shall
be protected in taking no action if
no direction is received. Except as
otherwise provided herein, the Trustee
shall consent or vote, or refrain from
consenting or voting, in the same
proportion (based on the Stated Amounts of
the Certificates of each Class as
allocated based on the respective Voting
Rights of each Class) as the
Certificates were actually voted or not
voted by the Holders thereof as of the
date determined by the Trustee prior to the
date such vote or consent is
required; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Base Trust Agreement or this Series
Supplement, the Trustee shall at no
time vote in favor of or consent to any
matter (i) which would alter the
timing or amount of any payment on the
Underlying Securities (including,
without limitation, any demand to
accelerate the Underlying Securities) or
(ii) which would result in the exchange or
substitution of any Underlying
Security whether or not pursuant to a plan
for the refunding or refinancing of
such Underlying Security, except in each
case with the unanimous consent of
the Certificateholders;
 
 
                               
      
11
<PAGE>
 
provided, further, that the Trustee shall
not take any such action if it would
affect the method, amount or timing of
payments due to the Swap Counterparty
or otherwise materially adversely affect
the interests of the Swap
Counterparty under the Swap Agreement and
result in a Swap Agreement
Termination Event, in each case without the
prior written consent of the Swap
Counterparty. The Trustee shall have no
liability for any failure to act or to
refrain from acting resulting from the
Certificateholders' late return of, or
failure to return, directions requested by
the Trustee from the
Certificateholders.
 
                 
(d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the
contrary, the Trustee may require from the
Certificateholders prior to taking
any action at the direction of the
Certificateholders, an indemnity agreement
of a Certificateholder or any of its
Affiliates to provide for security or
indemnity against the costs, expenses and
liabilities the Trustee may incur by
reason of any such action. An unsecured
indemnity agreement, if acceptable to
the Trustee, shall be deemed to be
sufficient to satisfy such security or
indemnity requirement.
 
                 
(e) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the
contrary, the Trustee shall act as the sole
Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent
and Registrar.
 
                 
Section 13. Compensation of Trustee. The Trustee shall be
entitled to receive from the Trustor as
compensation for its services
hereunder, trustee's fees pursuant to a
separate agreement between the Trustee
and the Trustor, and shall be reimbursed
for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made
by it (including the reasonable
compensation, disbursements and expenses of
its counsel and other persons not
regularly in its employ). The Trustor shall
indemnify and hold harmless the
Trustee and its successors, assigns, agents
and servants against any and all
loss, liability or reasonable expense
(including attorney's fees) incurred by
it in connection with the administration of
this trust and the performance of
its duties thereunder. The Trustee shall
notify the Trustor promptly of any
claim for which it may seek indemnity.
Failure by the Trustee to so notify the
Trustor shall not relieve the Trustor of
its obligations hereunder. The
Trustor need not reimburse any expense or
indemnify against any loss,
liability or expense incurred by the
Trustee through the Trustee's own willful
misconduct, negligence or bad faith. The
indemnities contained in this Section
13 shall survive the resignation or
termination of the Trustee or the
termination of this Agreement.
 
                 
Failure by the Trustor to pay, reimburse or indemnify the
Trustee shall not entitle the Trustee to
any payment, reimbursement or
indemnification from the Trust, nor shall
such failure release the Trustee
from the duties it is required to perform
under this Series Supplement. Any
unpaid, unreimbursed or unindemnified
amounts shall not be borne by the Trust
and shall not constitute a claim against
the Trust, but shall be borne by the
Trustee in its individual capacity, and the
Trustee shall have no recourse
against the Trust with respect thereto.
 
                 
Section 14. Modification or Amendment of the Base Trust
Agreement, the Series Supplement or the
Swap Agreement. (a) The Trustee shall
not enter into any modification or
amendment of the Base Trust Agreement or
this Series Supplement unless such
modification or amendment is in accordance
with Section 10.1 of the Base Trust
Agreement. If the Rating Agency Condition
is not satisfied with respect to any
proposed modification or amendment of the
Base Trust Agreement or this Series
Supplement, then any such modification or
amendment must be approved by 100% of the
Certificateholders. The Trustee
shall not enter into any
 
 
                                     
12
<PAGE>
 
amendment or modification of this Agreement
that would affect the method,
amount or timing of payment due to the Swap
Counterparty or the consent rights
of the Swap Counterparty hereunder or
otherwise materially adversely affect
the interests of the Swap Counterparty
under the Swap Agreement and result in
a Swap Agreement Termination Event, in each
case without the prior written
consent of the Swap Counterparty. The
Trustee shall provide fifteen Business
Days written notice to the Swap
Counterparty before entering into any
amendment or modification of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 14.
 
                 
(b) The Trustee shall not enter into any modification or
amendment of the Swap Agreement without the
prior written consent of holders
of Certificates representing 66 ?% of the
Voting Rights and without prior
written confirmation from the Rating Agency
that such amendment will not
result in a reduction or withdrawal of the
then current rating of the
Certificates; provided, however, that each
of the Swap Counterparty and the
Trustee may amend the Swap Agreement
without the prior written consent of
Certificateholders to cure any ambiguity
in, or to correct or supplement any
provision of the Swap Agreement which may
be inconsistent with any other
provision of the Swap Agreement, or to
otherwise cure any defect in the Swap
Agreement, provided that any such amendment
does not materially adversely
affect the interest of the
Certificateholders and that the Rating Agency will
have given its prior written confirmation
that such amendment will not result
in a reduction or withdrawal of the then
current rating of the Certificates;
provided further, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no
amendment may alter the timing or amount of
any payment on the Swap Agreement
without the prior consent of 100% of the
Certificateholders and without giving
the Rating Agency prior written notice of
any such amendment.
 
                 
(c) Until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual
knowledge of the occurrence of an event
that would constitute a Swap Agreement
Termination Event, the Trustee shall be
entitled to assume (and shall be fully
protected, indemnified and held harmless in
doing so) that no Swap Agreement
Termination Event has occurred and may
accordingly seek instructions under
Section 12 and this Section 14 exclusively
from the Swap Counterparty.
 
                 
Section 15. Assignment of Rights under the Swap Agreement.
The Trustee may consent to any transfer or
assignment by the Swap Counterparty
of its rights under the Swap Agreement, so
long as the Rating Agency shall
have given its prior written confirmation
that such transfer or assignment
will not result in a reduction or
withdrawal of the then current rating of the
Certificates.
 
                 
Section 16. Accounting. Notwithstanding Section 3.16 of the
Base Trust Agreement, "Independent Public
Accountants' Administration Report,"
no such accounting reports shall be
required. Pursuant to Section 4.2 of the
Base Trust Agreement, "Reports to
Certificateholders," the Trustee shall cause
the statement described in Section 4.2 to
be prepared and forwarded as
provided therein.
 
              
    Section
17. No Investment of Amounts Received on Underlying
Securities. All amounts received on or with
respect to the Underlying
Securities and all payments made to the
Trust on or with respect to the Swap
Agreement shall be held uninvested by the
Trustee.

Section 18. No Event of Default. There shall be no Events of
Default defined with respect to the
Certificates.

Agreement (including the grant of a
security interest in Section 10.8 of the
Base Trust Agreement with respect to

Supplement shall be read, taken
and construed as one and the same
instrument. To the extent there is any
inconsistency between the terms of the Base
Trust Agreement and this Series
Supplement, the terms of this Series
Supplement shall govern.
 
                 
Section 23. Counterparts. This Series Supplement may be
executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which so executed shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of such
counterparts shall together
constitute but one and the same
instrument.
 
                 
Section 24. Governing Law. This Series Supplement and each
Certificate issued hereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York
applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely therein without
reference to such State's principles of
conflicts of law to the extent that the
application of the laws of another
jurisdiction would be required thereby, and
the obligations, rights and
remedies of the parties hereunder shall be
determined in accordance with such
laws. The State of New York is the
securities intermediary's jurisdiction of
the Securities Intermediary for purposes of
the UCC.
 
                 
Section 25. Certificate of Compliance. The Trustor shall
deliver to the Trustee and the Swap
Counterparty on or prior to June 30 of
each year prior to a Trust Termination
Event the Officer's Certificate as to
compliance as required by Section 6.1(b) of
the Base Trust Agreement.
 
                 
Section 26. Certain Filing to be Made by the Trustee. In the
event that an event requiring the sale of
the Underlying Securities under this
Agreement occurs and the Underlying
Securities are liquidated at a loss, the
Trustee will disclose pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4 the
loss in accordance with the procedures of
such regulation, unless the Trustee
obtains advice from counsel that such
disclosure is not necessary. In general,
the Trustee will (x) attach a completed
Form 8886 to its tax return in the
year the requisite loss occurs and (y) file
a completed form with the Office
of Tax Shelter Analysis (OTSA) at: Internal
Revenue Service LM:PFTG:OTSA,
Large and Midsize Business Division, 1111
Constitution Avenue., NW.,
Washington DC 20224 (or such other address
subsequently required).
 
                 
Section 27. Establishment of Accounts. The Securities
Intermediary and the Trustee hereby
represent and warrant that:
 
                 
(a) Each Account for the Trust is a "securities account"
within the meaning of Section 8-501 of the
UCC and is held only in the name of
the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. The
Securities Intermediary is acting in
the capacity of a "securities intermediary"
within the meaning of Section
8-102(a)(14) of the UCC;
 
 
 
                
                     
15
<PAGE>
 
                 
(b) All Underlying Securities have been (i) delivered to the
Securities Intermediary pursuant to the
Agreement and (ii) credited to the
Certificate Account; and
 
                 
(c) Each Account is an account to which financial assets are
or may be credited, and the Securities
Intermediary shall treat the Trustee as
entitled to exercise the rights that
comprise any financial asset credited to
the Accounts.
 
                 
Section 28. Statement of Intent. It is the intention of the
parties hereto that, for purposes of
federal income taxes, state and local
income and franchise taxes and any other
taxes imposed upon, measured by or
based upon gross or net income, the Trust
shall be treated as a grantor trust,
but failing that, as a partnership (other
than a publicly traded partnership
taxable as a corporation) and, in any
event, shall not be classified as a
corporation. The parties hereto agree that,
unless otherwise required by
appropriate tax authorities, the Trustee
shall file or cause to be filed
annual or other necessary returns, reports
and other forms consistent with
such intended characterization. In the
event that the Trust is characterized
by appropriate tax authorities as a
partnership for federal income tax
purposes, each Certificateholder, by its
acceptance of its Certificate, agrees
to report its respective share of the items
of income, deductions, and credits
of the Trust on its respective returns. As
further consideration for each
Certificateholder's purchase of a
Certificate, each such Certificateholder is
deemed to agree not to irrevocably delegate
to any person (for a period of
more than one year) authority to purchase,
sell or exchange its Certificates.
 
                 
Each Certificateholder (and each beneficial owner of a
Certificate) by acceptance of its
Certificate (or its beneficial interest
therein) agrees, unless otherwise required
by appropriate tax authorities, to
file its own tax returns and reports in a
manner consistent with the
characterization indicated above.
 
                 
Section 29. Filing of Partnership Returns. In the event that
the Trust is characterized (by appropriate
tax authorities) as a partnership
for United States federal income tax
purposes the Trustor agrees to reimburse
the Trust for any expenses associated with
the filing of partnership returns
(or returns related thereto).
 
                 
Section 30. "Financial Assets" Election. The Securities
Intermediary hereby agrees that the
Underlying Securities credited to the
Certificate Account and any Posted
Collateral credited to the Collateral
Account shall be treated as a "financial
asset" within the meaning of Section
8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.
 
                 
Section 31. Trustee's Entitlement Orders. If at any time the
Securities Intermediary shall receive any
order from the Trustee directing the
transfer or redemption of any Underlying
Securities credited to the Accounts,
the Securities Intermediary shall comply
with such entitlement order without
further consent by the Trustor or any other
Person. The Securities
Intermediary shall take all instructions
(including without limitation all
notifications and entitlement orders) with
respect to the Accounts solely from
the Trustee.
 
                 
Section 32. Conflict with Other Agreements. The Securities
Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees
that:
 
 
 
                                     
16
<PAGE>
 
                 
(a) There are no other agreements entered into between the
Securities Intermediary and the Trustor
with respect to the Accounts. Each
Account and all property credited to the
Account is not subject to, and the
Securities Intermediary hereby waives, any
lien, security interest, right of
set off, or encumbrance in favor of the
Securities Intermediary or any Person
claiming through the Securities
Intermediary (other than the Trustee);
 
                 
(b) It has not entered into, and until the termination of
the Agreement will not enter into, any
agreement with any other Person
relating to the Accounts and/or any
financial assets credited thereto pursuant
to which it has agreed to comply with
entitlement orders of any Person other
than the Trustee; and
 
                 
(c) It has not entered into, and until the termination of
the Agreement will not enter into, any
agreement with any Person purporting to
limit or condition the obligation of the
Securities Intermediary to comply
with entitlement orders as set forth in
Section 31 hereof.
 
                 
Section 33. Additional Trustee and Securities Intermediary
Representations. The Trustee and the
Securities Intermediary each hereby
represents and warrants as follows:
 
                 
(a) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each
maintains its books and records with
respect to its securities accounts in the
State of New York;
 
                 
(b) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each has not
granted any lien on the Underlying
Securities nor are the Underlying
Securities subject to any lien on
properties of the Trustee or the Securities
Intermediary in its individual capacity;
the Trustee and the Securities
Intermediary each has no actual knowledge
and has not received actual notice
of any lien on the Underlying Securities
(other than any liens of the Trustee
in favor of the beneficiaries of the Trust
Agreement); other than the
interests of the Trustee, the
Certificateholders and the Swap Counterparty,
the books and records of the Trustee and
the Securities Intermediary each do
not identify any Person as having an
interest in the Underlying Securities;
and
 
                 
(c) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each makes
no representation as to (i) the validity,
legality, sufficiency or
enforceability of any of the Underlying
Securities or (ii) the collectability,
insurability, effectiveness or suitability
of any of the Underlying
Securities.
 
                 
Section 34. Additional Trustor Representations. The Trustor
hereby represents and warrants to the
Trustee as follows:
 
                 
(a) Immediately prior to the sale of the Underlying
Securities to the Trustee, the Trustor, as
Depositor, owned and had good and
marketable title to the Underlying
Securities free and clear of any lien,
claim or encumbrance of any Person;
 
                 
(b) The Trustor, as Depositor, has received all consents and
approvals required by the terms of the
Underlying Securities to the sale to
the Trustee of its interest and rights in
the Underlying Securities as
contemplated by the Agreement; and
 
                 
(c) The Trustor has not assigned, pledged, sold, granted a
security interest in or otherwise conveyed
any interest in the Underlying
Securities (or, if any such interest has
been assigned, pledged or otherwise
encumbered, it has been released), except
such interests sold
 
 
                                     
17
<PAGE>
 
pursuant to the Agreement. The Trustor has
not authorized the filing of and is
not aware of any financing statements
against the Trustor that includes a
description of the Underlying Securities,
other than any such filings pursuant
to the Agreement. The Trustor is not aware
of any judgment or tax lien filings
against Trustor.
 
                 
Section 35. Certification Requirements. The Trustee agrees
to obtain, at the Trustor's direction and
expense, a report of an independent

certification requirements under Rules 13a-14
and 15d-14 of the Exchange Act.
 
                 
Section 36. Additional Rights of the Swap Counterparty.

obligations of the Trustor and the Trust to
the Swap Counterparty under the
Swap Agreement and this Agreement. The Swap
Counterparty shall have the rights
of a third party beneficiary with respect
to this Agreement.
 
                 
Section 37. Modification of Certain Provisions of Base Trust
Agreement. The provisions of the Base Trust
Agreement shall be modified as
they are applied with respect to this
Series of Certificates to provide that
(i) notwithstanding Section 3.9 of the Base
Trust Agreement, the Certificate
Account shall be held for the benefit of
Certificateholders and the Swap
Counterparty and amounts in the Certificate
Account shall be used to make
distributions to the Swap Counterparty as
and when required under this Series
Supplement, (ii) the appointment of any
successor of the Trustee under Section
8.7 of the Base Trust Agreement shall be
subject to the prior approval of the
Swap Counterparty and (iii) notwithstanding
Section 9.1(a) of the Base Trust

therein, the respective obligations and
responsibilities under this Agreement of
the Trustor and the Trustee shall
terminate upon the distribution to

Counterparty of all amounts held in all the
Accounts and required to be paid
to such Holders or the Swap Counterparty

coinciding with or following the final

2005, subject to satisfaction of all of the
conditions set forth in clause

percentage of the Underlying
Securities as such Certificates represent
of all outstanding Certificates.
 
                 
(b) The following conditions shall apply to any Optional
Exchange:
 
 
 
                                     
18
<PAGE>
 
                 
(A) A notice specifying the number of Certificates being
        
surrendered and the optional exchange date shall be delivered to
the
        
Trustee no less than 5 days (or such shorter period acceptable to
the
        
Trustee) but not more than 30 days before the optional exchange
date.
 
                 
(B) Certificates shall be surrendered to the trustee no
        
later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the optional
exchange
        
date.
 
                 
(C) The Trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel
        
stating that the Optional Exchange would not cause the Trust to
be
        
classified as a corporation or publicly traded partnership taxable
as
        
a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
 
                 
(D) The Trustee shall not be obligated to determine whether
        
an Optional Exchange complies with the applicable provisions
for
        
exemption under Rule 3a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as
        
amended, or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.

this
        
Section 39. This Section 39 shall not provide any Person with a
lien
        
against, an interest in or a right to specific performance with
        
respect to the Underlying Securities; provided that satisfaction
of
        
the conditions set forth in this Section 39 shall entitle the
        
Depositor to a distribution thereof.
 
                 
(F) The aggregate principal balance of Certificates
        
exchanged in connection with any Optional Exchange pursuant to
this
        
Section 39 shall be in an amount that results in a distribution

denomination
        
of the Underlying Securities.
 
                 
(G) No Swap Agreement Termination Event shall have occurred
        
as a result of the Optional Exchange except to the extent of a
        
termination resulting from the reduction in the Hedge Notional
Amount
        
(as defined in the Swap Agreement) to an amount equal to the
        
principal amount of the Underlying Securities after giving effect
to
        
the Optional Exchange.
 
                 
(H) Any payments due under the Swap Agreement as a result of
        
the reduction in such Hedge Notional Amount and any such Swap
        
Agreement Termination Event (x) that are due to the Swap
Counterparty
        
(including but not limited to Unpaid Amounts) shall have been paid
to
        
the Swap Counterparty by the Depositor and (y) that are payable
by
        
the Swap Counterparty, shall be payable for the account of the
        
Depositor.

Certificate does not purport to

is hereby made to the Trust
Agreement for information with respect to

Underlying Securities have been received by
the Trust and any amounts owed to
the Swap Counterparty under the Swap
Agreement have been paid to the Swap
Counterparty. Thereafter, and so long as
the Swap Agreement is in effect,
interest on the Certificates will be
payable semi-annually on each February 15
and August 15 (or the next succeeding
business day), until the Certificates
have been retired.
 
        
The distributions in respect of this Certificate are payable in
such
coin or currency of the United States of
America as at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and
private debts as set forth in the
Series Trust Agreement.
 
        
The Underlying Securities held by the Trust are subject to the
rights
of the Swap Counterparty, as provided for
in the Series Supplement and the
Swap Agreement, and each Certificateholder,
by accepting its Certificate,
acknowledges such rights in accordance with
the terms of the Series Supplement
and the Swap Agreement.
 
        
It is the intent of the Trustor and the Certificateholders that
the
Trust will be classified as a grantor trust
under subpart E, Part I of
subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as
 
                                    
C-2
 
<PAGE>
 
amended. Except as otherwise required by
appropriate taxing authorities, the
Trustor and the Trustee, by executing the
Trust Agreement, and each
Certificateholder, by acceptance of a
Certificate, agrees to treat, and to
take no action inconsistent with the
treatment of, the Certificates for such
tax purposes as interests in a grantor
trust and the provisions of the Trust
Agreement shall be interpreted to further
this intention of the parties.
 
        
By acceptance of a Certificate, each Certificateholder (1) elects
to
integrate the Underlying Securities and the
Swap Agreement for United States
federal income tax purposes, (2) authorizes
and directs the trustee (or the
trustee's agent) to retain, as part of the
Certificateholder's books and
records, information that (a) describes the
Underlying Securities and the Swap
Agreement, (b) identifies the two positions
as integrated for federal income
tax purposes and (c) describes the features
of the resulting "synthetic" debt
instrument and (3) agrees to retain copies
of such information as provided to
the Certificateholder by the Trust.
 
        
Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Certificate,
covenants
and agrees that such Certificateholder
shall not, prior to the date which is
one year and one day after the termination
of the Trust Agreement, acquiesce,
petition or otherwise invoke or cause the
Trustor to invoke the process of any
court or governmental authority for the
purpose of commencing or sustaining a
case against the Trustor under any federal
or state bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar law or appointing
a receiver, liquidator, assignee,
trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other
similar official of the Trustor or
any substantial part of its property, or
ordering the winding up or
liquidation of the affairs of the
Trustor.
 
        
Certificates may not be acquired by or for the account of any
employee benefit plan, trust or account,
including an individual retirement
account, that is subject to the
requirements of Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, or that is described in
Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, or by or
for the account of any entity whose
underlying assets include any assets
subject to these laws by reason of
investment in that entity by such plans,
trusts or accounts. By accepting and
holding this Certificate, the holder of
this Certificate will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that it is
not a plan or entity described
above, and that its acquisition and holding
of this Certificate are in
compliance with the foregoing
restrictions.
 
        
The Trust Agreement permits the amendment thereof, in certain
circumstances, without the consent of the
Holders of any of the Certificates.
 
        
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been
executed by an authorized officer of the
Trustee by manual signature, this
Certificate shall not entitle the Holder
hereof to any benefit under the Trust
Agreement or be valid for any purpose.
 
        
A copy of the Trust Agreement is available upon request and all
of
its terms and conditions are hereby
incorporated by reference and made a part
hereof.
 
        
THIS CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO
ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS,
AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE
DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH
LAWS.

MASTER AGREEMENT
 
                       
dated as of September 30, 2005
 
 
 
 
WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL         
and STRATS(SM) TRUST FOR GOLMAN SACHS CAPITAL I
ASSOCIATION                         
SECURITIES, SERIES 2005-3
 
 
have entered and/or anticipate entering
into one of more transactions (each a
"Transaction") that are or will be governed
by this Master Agreement, which
includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and
the documents and other confirming
evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged
between the parties confirming
those Transactions.
 
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:
--
 
1.       
Interpretation
 
(a)      
Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule
will
have the meanings therein specified for the
purpose of this Master Agreement.
 
(b)      
Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the
provisions of the Schedule and the other
provisions of this Master Agreement,
the Schedule will prevail. In the event of
any inconsistency between the
provisions of any Confirmation and this
Master Agreement (including the
Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail
for the purpose of the relevant
Transaction.
 
(c)       Single
Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on
the fact that this Master Agreement and all
Confirmations form a single
agreement between the parties (collectively
referred to as this "Agreement"),
and the parties would not otherwise enter
into any Transactions.
 
2.       
Obligations
 
(a)       General
Conditions.
 
        
(i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in
each
        
Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions
of
        
this Agreement.
 
        
(ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date
for
        
value on that date in the place of the account specified in the
        
relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement,
in
        
freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments
in
        
the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that
is,
        
other than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on
the
        
due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation
unless
        
otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in
this
        
Agreement.
 
        
(iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is
subject
        
to (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or
Potential
        
Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and
is
 
 
                                   
D-1-1
<PAGE>
 
        
continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early
Termination
        
Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or
been
        
effectively designated and (3) each other applicable condition
        
precedent specified in this Agreement.
 
(b)       Change of
Account. Either party may change its account for receiving
a payment or delivery by giving notice to
the other party at least five Local
Business Days prior to the scheduled date
for the payment or delivery to which
such change applies unless such other party
gives timely notice of a
reasonable objection to such change.
 
(c)       Netting.
If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable: --
 
        
(i) in the same currency; and
 
        
(ii) in respect of the same Transaction,
 
by each party to the other. then, on such
date, each party's obligation to
make payment of any such amount will be
automatically satisfied and discharged
and, if the aggregate amount that would
otherwise have been payable by one
party exceeds the aggregate amount that
would otherwise have been payable by
the other party, replaced by an obligation
upon the party by whom the larger
aggregate amount would have been payable to
pay to the other party the excess
of the larger aggregate amount over the
smaller aggregate amount.
 
The parties may elect in respect of two or
more Transactions that a net amount
will be determined in respect of all
amounts payable on the same date in the
same currency in respect of such
Transactions, regardless of whether such
amounts are payable in respect of the same
Transaction. The election may be
made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by
specifying that subparagraph (ii)
above will not apply to the Transactions
identified as being subject to the
election, together with the starting date
(in which case subparagraph (ii)
above will not, or will cease to, apply to
such Transactions from such date).
This election may be made separately for
different groups of Transactions and
will apply separately to each pairing of
Offices through which the parties
make and receive payments or
deliveries.
 
(d)       Deduction
or Withholding for Tax.
 
        
(i) Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made
without
        
any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless
such
        
deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as
        
modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue
        
authority, then in effect. If a party is so required to deduct
or
        
withhold, then that party ("X") will: --
 
                 
(1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such
                  
requirement;
 
                 
(2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required
                 
to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount
                 
required to be deducted or withheld from any additional
                  
amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon
                 
the earlier of determining that such deduction or
                 
withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount
                 
has been assessed against Y;
 
                 
(3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a
                 
certified copy), or other documentation reasonably
                 
acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such
                 
authorities; and
 
                 
(4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in
                 
addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled
                 
under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary
                 
to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free
                 
and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes. whether assessed against X
                 
or Y) will equal ft full amount Y would have received had no
                 
such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will
                 
not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the
                 
extent that it would not be required to be paid but for: --
 
                          
(A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any
                          
agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii)
                          
or 4(d); or
 
                          
(B) the failure of a representation made by Y
                          
pursuant to Section 3(f) to be accurate and true
                          
unless such failure would not have occurred but for
                          
(I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
                          
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or
         
                 
after the date on which a
 
 
                                   
D-1-2
<PAGE>
 
                          
Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether
                          
such action is taken or brought with respect to a
                           
party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax
                          
Law.
 
        
(ii)     
Liability. If: --
 
                 
(1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
                 
practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to
                 
make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X
                 
would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under
                 
Section 2(d)(i)(4);
 
                 
(2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and
 
                 
(3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly
                 
against X,
 
        
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies
the
        
liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the
        
amount of such liability (including any related liability for
        
interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if
Y
        
has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in
        
Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).
 
(e)       Default
Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in
respect of the relevant
Transaction, a party that defaults in the
performance of any payment
obligation will, to the extent permitted by
law and subject to Section 6(c),
be required to pay interest (before as well
as after judgment) on the overdue
amount to the other party on demand in the
same currency as such overdue
amount, for the period from (and including)
the original due date for payment
to (but excluding) the date of actual
payment, at the Default Rate. Such
interest will be calculated on the basis of
daily compounding and the actual
number of days elapsed. If, prior to the
occurrence or effective designation
of an Early Termination Date in respect of
the relevant Transaction, a party
defaults in the performance of any
obligation required to be settled by
delivery, it will compensate the other
party on demand if and to the extent
provided for in the relevant Confirmation
or elsewhere in this Agreement.
 
3.       
Representations
 
Each party represents to the other party
(which representations will be deemed
to be repeated by each party on each date
on which a Transaction is entered
into and, in the case of the
representations in Section 3(f), at all times
until the termination of this Agreement)
that: --
 
(a)       Basic
Representations.
 
        
(i) Status. It is duly organised and validly existing under the
laws
        
of the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and,
if
        
relevant under such laws, in good standing;
 
        
(ii) Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any
other
        
documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party,
to
        
deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to
this
        
Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and
to
        
perform its obligations under this

(the "Base Trust Agreement" and, as supplemented pursuant to the Series         
Supplement, the "Agreement"), between the Trustor and the Trustee, such         
parties may at any time and from time to time enter into a series supplement    
supplemental to the Base Trust Agreement for the purpose of creating a trust.   
Section 5.13 of the Base Trust Agreement provides that the Trustor may at any   
time and from time to time direct the Trustee to authenticate and deliver, on   
behalf of any such trust, a new Series of trust certificates. Each trust        
certificate of such new Series of trust certificates will represent a           
fractional undivided beneficial interest in such trust. Certain terms and       
conditions applicable to each such Series are to be set forth in the related    
series supplement to the Base Trust Agreement.                                  

   Pursuant to this Series Supplement, the Trustor and the Trustee
shall create and establish a new trust to be known as STRATS(SM) Trust For      
Morgan Stanley Securities, Series 2004-12, and a new Series of trust            
certificates to be issued thereby, which certificates shall be known as the     
STRATS(SM) Certificates, Series 2004-12, and the Trustor and the Trustee shall  
herein specify certain terms and conditions in respect thereof. The Trust       
shall also enter into a swap agreement (the "Swap Agreement") pursuant to       
which the Trust will exchange interest payments due on the Underlying           
Securities for payments from the Swap Counterparty which will be passed         
through to the Certificateholders.                                              

      The STRATS(SM) Certificates, Series 2004-12 shall be floating rate
Certificates (the "Certificates") issued in the form thereof set forth in       
Exhibit C.                                                                      

   On behalf of and pursuant to the authorizing resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Trustor, an authorized officer of the Trustor has     
authorized the execution, authentication and delivery of the Certificates, and  
has authorized the Base Trust Agreement, the Swap Agreement (as defined         
below), and this Series Supplement in accordance with the terms of Section

usage which shall be applicable hereto.                                         

      (b) Pursuant to Article I of the Base Trust Agreement, the meaning

Section 2. Creation and Declaration of Trust; Sale of Underlying
Securities; Acceptance by Trustee. (a) The Trust, of which the Trustee is the   
trustee, is hereby created under the laws of the State of New York for the      
benefit of the holders of the Certificates and the Swap Counterparty. The       
Trust shall be irrevocable.                                                     

   (b) The Trustor, acting as Depositor, does hereby sell, assign,
convey and set-over to the Trustee, on behalf and for the benefit of the        
Trust, the Underlying Securities at a purchase price of $4,910,000 in cash.

delivering to Wachovia Securities, for the account of the Depositor, and as     
the assignee of Depositor with respect to such amounts, (i) $4,910,000 on the

Wachovia Securities, for the account of the Depositor, and as assignee of       
Depositor with respect to such amounts, shall have a claim for the unpaid       
portion of such amount and shall share pari passu with Certificateholders to    
the extent of such claim in the proceeds from the sale or recovery of the       
Underlying Securities. The Trustor hereby instructs the Trustee on behalf of    
and for the benefit

Section 3. Designation. There is hereby created a Series of trust

Supplement to be known as the "STRATS(SM) Certificates, Series 2004-12". The

Certificates shall be issued in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C   
to this Series Supplement with such necessary or appropriate changes as shall   
be approved by the Trustor and the Trustee, such approval to be manifested by   
the execution and authentication thereof by the Trustee. The Certificates

subject to the liabilities of the Trust and shall be payable solely from

Trustee and deposited in the Trust. Such Stated Amount shall be calculated      
without regard to Certificates authenticated and delivered upon registration    
of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Certificates pursuant  
to Sections 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5 of the Base Trust Agreement.

 Section 8. Swap Payments; Collateral Account. (a) The Trust shall
pay to the Swap Counterparty (i) for so long as the Swap Agreement shall not    
have been terminated, an amount equal to all interest payments payable on the   
Underlying Securities on each Underlying Securities Payment Date or on any      
other date on which such amounts are received by the Trust, excluding any       
amount of interest that accrued with respect to the Underlying Securities from  
the Underlying Securities Payment Date immediately preceding the Closing Date   
to, but excluding, the Closing Date and (ii) all other amounts owing to the     
Swap Counterparty under the Swap Agreement to the extent Trust assets are       
sufficient therefor, including but not limited to all Unpaid Amounts upon the   
occurrence of any Swap Agreement Termination Event                              

    (b) The Trustee shall within 3 Business Days of the Closing Date
establish the Collateral Account. Any and all amounts at any time on deposit    
in the Collateral Account shall be held in trust by the Trustee for the         
benefit of Certificateholders and the Swap Counterparty; provided, that, the    
only permitted withdrawal from or application of funds on deposit in, or        
otherwise to the credit of, the Collateral Account shall be (i) for             
application to obligations of the Swap Counterparty to the Trust under the      
Swap Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Swap Agreement or (ii) to    
return Posted Collateral to the Swap Counterparty when and as required by the   
Swap Agreement, which the Trustee shall return to the Swap Counterparty in      
accordance with the related Swap Agreement.                                     

Section 9. Certain Provisions of Base Trust Agreement Not   
Applicable. The provisions of Sections 5.11, 5.16, 6.2, Article VII, 8.1, 8.2   
and 8.10 of the Base Trust Agreement and any other provision of the Base Trust  
Agreement which imposes obligations on or creates rights in favor of the        
Trustee or the Certificateholders as a result of or in connection with an       
"Event of Default" or "Administrative Agent Termination Event" shall be         
inapplicable with respect to the Certificates. In addition, there is no         
"Administrative Agent" specified herein, and all references to "Administrative  
Agent" in the Base Trust Agreement, therefore shall be inapplicable with        
respect to the Certificates.                                                    

Section 10. Distributions. (a) On each Distribution Date, so long as
no Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred for which the Trust is the     
Defaulting Party or an Affected Party, the Trustee shall distribute to the      
Certificateholders the Interest Collections. On the Maturity Date, and to the   
extent received on any other Scheduled Distribution Date, so long as no Swap    
Agreement Termination Event has occurred for which the Trust is the Defaulting  
Party or an Affected Party, the Trustee shall distribute to the                 
Certificateholders, the principal amount of the Underlying Securities to the    
extent the principal of the Underlying Securities is received by the Trustee    
on such date or during the related Collection Period plus any accrued interest  
thereon.                                                                        

        (b) If a Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred for which the
Trust is the Defaulting Party or an Affected Party the Trustee, first, shall    
distribute all collections received on the Underlying Securities to the Swap    
Counterparty until all amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty under the Swap    
Agreement for payments in connection with such Swap Agreement Termination       
Event (including any Unpaid Amounts) have been paid in full and, second, shall  
distribute all remaining amounts to the Certificateholders. If the              
distribution in the preceding sentence is insufficient to pay in full all       
amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty, the Trustee shall proceed to liquidate  
or distribute the Underlying Securities in accordance with                      

7   

P-->EX-4.111th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
Section 10(h). Upon any liquidation of the Underlying Securities, the Trustee,  
first, shall distribute the proceeds thereof to the Swap Counterparty until     
all amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty have been paid in full and, second,  
shall distribute all remaining amounts to the Certificateholders. In the event  
of a Swap Agreement Termination Event, after paying all amounts due to the      
Swap Counterparty as set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10(b), if  
no Trust Termination Event has occurred, all Interest Collections shall         
thereafter be distributed to Certificateholders on each applicable              
Distribution Date. If a Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred for       
which the Swap Counterparty is the Defaulting Party or the only Affected        
Party, notwithstanding the termination of the Swap Agreement, the Trustee       
shall distribute any Unpaid Amounts to the Swap Counterparty from Interest      
Collections on the Underlying Securities.                                       

  (c) In all cases hereunder, if any payment with respect to the
Underlying Securities is made to the Trustee after the Underlying Securities    
Payment Date on which such payment was due, the Trustee shall distribute such   
amount received on the Business Day following such receipt.                     

        (d) In the event of a Payment Default while the Swap Agreement is in
effect and if any payment is due to the Swap Counterparty, the Underlying       
Securities will be liquidated in accordance with Section 10(h). Otherwise, in   
the event of a Payment Default, the Trustee shall proceed against the           
Underlying Securities Issuer on behalf of the Certificateholders to enforce     
the Underlying Securities or otherwise to protect the interests of the          
Certificateholders, subject to the receipt of indemnity in form and substance   
satisfactory to the Trustee; provided, that Holders of the Certificates         
representing a majority of the Voting Rights on the Certificates will be        
entitled to direct the Trustee in any such proceeding or direct the Trustee to  
sell the Underlying Securities, subject to the Trustee's receipt of             
satisfactory indemnity.                                                         

      (e) In the event of an Acceleration and a corresponding payment on
the Underlying Securities prior to any liquidation of the Underlying            
Securities hereunder, the Trustee shall distribute the proceeds to the          
Certificateholders no later than two (2) Business Days after the receipt of     
immediately available funds pursuant to Section 10(b).                          

     (f) In the event the Trustee receives property other than cash in
respect of the Underlying Securities such property will be applied first, to    
the Swap Counterparty until all amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty have     
been paid in full and, second, to the Certificateholders. Property other than   
cash will be liquidated by the Trustee, and the proceeds thereof distributed    
in cash, to the extent necessary to pay to the Swap Counterparty all amounts    
owed to it under the Swap Agreement and, thereafter, to the extent necessary    
to avoid distribution of fractional securities to Certificateholders. In-kind   
distribution of Underlying Securities or other property to Certificateholders   
will be deemed to reduce the Stated Amount of Certificates on a proportionate   
basis. Following such in-kind distribution, all Certificates will be            
cancelled. No amounts will be distributed to the Trustor in respect of the      
Underlying Securities. The Swap Counterparty shall direct the Trustee with      
respect to any liquidation of such property to the extent of the full amount    
owed to it under the Swap Agreement.                                            

  (g) If an SEC Reporting Failure occurs, then the Trustor shall
promptly notify the Trustee, the Swap Counterparty and the Rating Agency of     
such SEC Reporting Failure and                                                  

8   

P-->EX-4.112th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�12th
the Trustee shall proceed to liquidate or distribute the Underlying Securities  
in accordance with Section 10(h).                                               

      (h) If at any time, the Trustee is directed to sell the Underlying
Securities, the Trustee shall solicit bids for the sale of the Underlying       
Securities with settlement thereof on or before the third (3rd) Business Day    
after such sale from three leading dealers in the relevant market, which may    
include but is not limited to any three of the following dealers: (1) Wachovia  
Securities, (2) Goldman, Sachs & Co., (3) Lehman Brothers Inc., (4) Merrill     
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, (5) Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,  
(6) J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and (7) Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.;          
provided, however, that no bid from Wachovia Securities or any affiliate        
thereof shall be accepted unless such bid equals the then fair market value of  
such Underlying Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the        
failure to obtain a bid so long as it has made reasonable efforts to obtain     
bids. If a bid for the sale of the Underlying Securities has been accepted by   
the Trustee but the sale has failed to settle on the proposed settlement date,  
the Trustee shall request new bids from such leading dealers. In any            
circumstance in which the sale of the Underlying Securities is required         
hereunder, the Trustee shall, to the extent it is so directed by the Trustor,   
provide Certificateholders with the option to elect to receive an "in-kind"     
distribution of their pro rata share of the Underlying Securities; provided,    
that, (1) an in-kind distribution shall be subject to the prior sale of         
Underlying Securities in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10(h)   
to the extent necessary, to pay any amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty      
under Section 10(b), (2) a Certificateholders' pro rata share of the            
Underlying Securities shall be a principal amount of Underlying Securities      
equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Underlying Securities            
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the Stated Amount of that    
holder's Certificates and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal   
amount of the Underlying Securities minus the amount required to be             
distributed to the Swap Counterparty pursuant to the second sentence of         
Section 10(b) and (3) odd-lot amounts that cannot be distributed in-kind        
because they are not within the authorized denominations of the Underlying      
Securities shall be distributed in cash. Any such in-kind distribution shall    
constitute the final distribution in respect of the Certificates as to which    
such option is exercised.                                                       

    (i) Distributions to the Certificateholders on each Distribution
Date will be made to the Certificateholders of record on the Record Date.       

      (j) All distributions to Certificateholders shall be allocated pro
rata among the Certificates based on their respective Outstanding Amounts as    
of the Record Date.                                                             

       (k) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary,
to the extent funds are available, the Trustee will initiate payment in         
immediately available funds by 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on each           
Distribution Date of all amounts payable to each Certificateholder with         
respect to any Certificate held by such Certificateholder or its nominee        
(without the necessity for any presentation or surrender thereof or any         
notation of such payment thereon) in the manner and at the address as each      
Certificateholder may from time to time direct the Trustee in writing 15 days   
prior to such Distribution Date requesting that such payment will be so made    
and designating the bank account to which such payments shall be so made. The   
Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the last instruction delivered by the      
Certificateholder pursuant to this Section 10(f) unless a new instruction is    
delivered 15 days prior to a Distribution Date.

        (l) The rights of the Certificateholders to receive distributions in
respect of the Certificates, and all interests of the Certificateholders in     
such distributions, shall be as set forth in this Series Supplement. The        
Trustee shall in no way be responsible or liable to the Certificateholders nor  
shall any Certificateholder in any way be responsible or liable to any other    
Certificateholder in respect of amounts previously distributed on the           
Certificates based on their respective Outstanding Amounts.                     

Section 11. Termination of Trust. (a) The Trust shall terminate upon
the occurrence of any Trust Termination Event.                                  

   (b) Except for any reports and other information required to be
provided to Certificateholders hereunder and under the Base Trust Agreement     
and except as otherwise specified herein and therein, the obligations of the    
Trustee will terminate upon the distribution to the Swap Counterparty and       
Certificateholders of all amounts required to be distributed to them and the    
disposition of all Underlying Securities held by the Trustee. The Trust shall   
thereupon terminate, except for surviving rights of indemnity.                  

Section 12. Limitation of Powers and Duties. (a) The Trustee shall
administer the Trust and the Underlying Securities solely as specified herein   
and in the Base Trust Agreement.                                                

        (b) The Trust is constituted solely for the purpose of acquiring and
holding the Underlying Securities, entering into and performing its             
obligations under the Swap Agreement and issuing the Certificates. The Trustee  
is not authorized to acquire any other investments or engage in any activities  
not authorized herein and, in particular, unless expressly provided in the      
Agreement, the Trustee is not authorized (i) to sell, assign, transfer,         
exchange, pledge, set-off or otherwise dispose of any of the Underlying         
Securities, once acquired, or interests therein, including to                   
Certificateholders, (ii) to merge or consolidate the Trust with any other       
entity, or (iii) to do anything that would materially increase the likelihood   
that the Trust will fail to qualify as a grantor trust for United States        
federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Trustee has no power to create,   
assume or incur indebtedness or other liabilities in the name of the Trust      
other than as contemplated herein and in the Base Trust Agreement.              

      (c) The parties acknowledge that the Trustee, as the holder of the
Underlying Securities, has the right to vote and give consents and waivers in   
respect of the Underlying Securities and enforce the other rights, if any, of   
a holder of the Underlying Securities, except as otherwise limited by the Base  
Trust Agreement or this Series Supplement. In the event that the Trustee        
receives a request from the Underlying Securities Trustee, the Underlying       
Securities Issuer or, if applicable, the Depositary with respect to the         
Underlying Securities, for the Trustee's consent to any amendment,              
modification or waiver of the Underlying Securities, or any document relating   
thereto, or receives any other solicitation for any action with respect to the  
Underlying Securities, the Trustee shall within two (2) Business Days mail a    
notice of such proposed amendment, modification, waiver or solicitation to the  
Swap Counterparty and each Certificateholder of record as of the date of such   
request. The Trustee shall request instructions from the Certificateholders as  
to what action to take in response to such request and shall be protected in    
taking no action if no direction is received. Except as otherwise provided      
herein, the Trustee shall consent or vote, or refrain from consenting or        
voting, in the same proportion (based

on the Stated Amounts of the Certificates of each Class as allocated based on   
the respective Voting Rights of each Class) as the Certificates were actually   
voted or not voted by the Holders thereof as of the date determined by the      
Trustee prior to the date such vote or consent is required; provided, however,  
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Base Trust Agreement or   
this Series Supplement, the Trustee shall at no time vote in favor of or        
consent to any matter (i) which would alter the timing or amount of any         
payment on the Underlying Securities (including, without limitation, any        
demand to accelerate the Underlying Securities) or (ii) which would result in   
the exchange or substitution of any Underlying Security whether or not          
pursuant to a plan for the refunding or refinancing of such Underlying          
Security, except in each case with the unanimous consent of the                 
Certificateholders; provided, further, that the Trustee shall not take any      
such action if it would affect the method, amount or timing of payments due to  
the Swap Counterparty or otherwise materially adversely affect the interests    
of the Swap Counterparty under the Swap Agreement and result in a Swap          
Agreement Termination Event, in each case without the prior written consent of  
the Swap Counterparty. The Trustee shall have no liability for any failure to   
act or to refrain from acting resulting from the Certificateholders' late       
return of, or failure to return, directions requested by the Trustee from the   
Certificateholders.                                                             

       (d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary,
the Trustee may require from the Certificateholders prior to taking any action  
at the direction of the Certificateholders, an indemnity agreement of a         
Certificateholder or any of its Affiliates to provide for security or           
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities the Trustee may incur by  
reason of any such action. An unsecured indemnity agreement, if acceptable to   
the Trustee, shall be deemed to be sufficient to satisfy such security or       
indemnity requirement.                                                          

       (e) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary,
the Trustee shall act as the sole Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent and        
Registrar.                                                                      

Section 13. Compensation of Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled
to receive from the Trustor as compensation for its services hereunder,         
trustee's fees pursuant to a separate agreement between the Trustee and the     
Trustor, and shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses, disbursements     
and advances incurred or made by it (including the reasonable compensation,     
disbursements and expenses of its counsel and other persons not regularly in    
its employ). The Trustor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and its  
successors, assigns, agents and servants against any and all loss, liability    
or reasonable expense (including attorney's fees) incurred by it in connection  
with the administration of this trust and the performance of its duties         
thereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Trustor promptly of any claim for      
which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Trustor    
shall not relieve the Trustor of its obligations hereunder. The Trustor need    
not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense   
incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own willful misconduct,           
negligence or bad faith. The indemnities contained in this Section 13 shall     
survive the resignation or termination of the Trustee or the termination of     
this Agreement.                                                                 

     Failure by the Trustor to pay, reimburse or indemnify the Trustee
shall not entitle the Trustee to any payment, reimbursement or indemnification  
from the Trust, nor shall such failure release the Trustee from the duties it   
is required to perform under this Series Supplement. Any unpaid, unreimbursed   
or unindemnified amounts shall not be borne by the Trust and shall              

11  

P-->EX-4.115th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
not constitute a claim against the Trust, but shall be borne by the Trustee in  
its individual capacity, and the Trustee shall have no recourse against the     
Trust with respect thereto.                                                     

Section 14. Modification or Amendment of the Base Trust Agreement,
the Series Supplement or the Swap Agreement. (a) The Trustee shall not enter    
into any modification or amendment of the Base Trust Agreement or this Series   
Supplement unless such modification or amendment is in accordance with Section  
10.1 of the Base Trust Agreement. If the Rating Agency Condition is not         
satisfied with respect to any proposed modification or amendment of the Base    
Trust Agreement or this Series Supplement, then any such modification or        
amendment must be approved by 100% of the Certificateholders. The Trustee       
shall not enter into any amendment or modification of this Agreement that       
would affect the method, amount or timing of payment due to the Swap            
Counterparty or the consent rights of the Swap Counterparty hereunder or        
otherwise materially adversely affect the interests of the Swap Counterparty    
under the Swap Agreement and result in a Swap Agreement Termination Event, in   
each case without the prior written consent of the Swap Counterparty. The       
Trustee shall provide fifteen Business Days written notice to the Swap          
Counterparty before entering into any amendment or modification of this         
Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.                                          

      (b) The Trustee shall not enter into any modification or amendment
of the Swap Agreement without the prior written consent of holders of           
Certificates representing 66 ?% of the Voting Rights and without prior written  
confirmation from the Rating Agency that such amendment will not result in a    
reduction or withdrawal of the then current rating of the Certificates;         
provided, however, that each of the Swap Counterparty and the Trustee may       
amend the Swap Agreement without the prior written consent of                   
Certificateholders to cure any ambiguity in, or to correct or supplement any    
provision of the Swap Agreement which may be inconsistent with any other        
provision of the Swap Agreement, or to otherwise cure any defect in the Swap    
Agreement, provided that any such amendment does not materially adversely       
affect the interest of the Certificateholders and that the Rating Agency will   
have given its prior written confirmation that such amendment will not result   
in a reduction or withdrawal of the then current rating of the Certificates;    
provided further, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no    
amendment may alter the timing or amount of any payment on the Swap Agreement   
without the prior consent of 100% of the Certificateholders and without giving  
the Rating Agency prior written notice of any such amendment.                   

       (c) Until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge
of the occurrence of an event that would constitute a Swap Agreement            
Termination Event, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume (and shall be fully  
protected, indemnified and held harmless in doing so) that no Swap Agreement    
Termination Event has occurred and may accordingly seek instructions under      
Section 12 and this Section 14 exclusively from the Swap Counterparty.          

Section 15. Assignment of Rights under the Swap Agreement. The
Trustee may consent to any transfer or assignment by the Swap Counterparty of   
its rights under the Swap Agreement, so long as the Rating Agency shall have    
given its prior written confirmation that such transfer or assignment will not  
result in a reduction or withdrawal of the then current rating of the           
Certificates.

 Section 16. Accounting. Notwithstanding Section 3.16 of the Base
Trust Agreement, "Independent Public Accountants' Administration Report," no    
such accounting reports shall be required. Pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Base  
Trust Agreement, "Reports to Certificateholders," the Trustee shall cause the

     (c) In the event a Payment Default or an Acceleration occurs, the
Trustee shall promptly give notice to the Swap Counterparty and to the          
Depositary or, for any Certificates which are not then held by the Depositary

        (d) Notwithstanding any provisions of the Agreement to the contrary,
the Trustee shall deliver all notices or reports required to be delivered to    
or by the Trustee or the Trustor to the Certificateholders or the Swap

       (e) The Trustee shall, in connection with any notice or delivery of
documents to Certificateholders (whether or not such notice or delivery is      
required pursuant to the

Agreement), provide such notice or documents to the Swap Counterparty           
concurrently with the delivery thereof to the Certificateholders.

regarding the Underlying Securities will be afforded without charge to any      
Certificateholder so requesting pursuant to Section 3.17 of the Base Trust      
Agreement, "Access to Certain Documentation." Additionally, the Trustee shall   
provide at the request of any Certificateholder without charge to such

Certificates hereunder as recorded in the Certificate Register for purposes of

or for the purposes of effecting purchases or sales of the Certificates,        
subject to the transfer restrictions set forth herein.

Section 22. Ratification of Agreement. With respect to the Series
issued hereby, the Base Trust Agreement (including the grant of a security      
interest in Section 10.8 of the Base Trust Agreement with respect to the        
Underlying Securities conveyed hereunder), as supplemented by this Series       
Supplement, is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Base Trust       
Agreement as so supplemented by this Series Supplement shall be read, taken     
and construed as one and the same instrument. To the extent there is any        
inconsistency between the terms of the Base Trust Agreement and this Series     
Supplement, the terms of this Series Supplement shall govern.                   

Section 23. Counterparts. This Series Supplement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an  
original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute but one and    
the same instrument.                                                            

Section 24. Governing Law. This Series Supplement and each  
Certificate issued hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance   
with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be  
performed entirely therein without reference to such State's principles of      
conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the laws of another      
jurisdiction would be required thereby, and the obligations, rights and         
remedies of the parties hereunder shall be determined in accordance with such   
laws. The State of New York is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction of    
the Securities Intermediary for purposes of the UCC.                            

Section 25. Certificate of Compliance. The Trustor shall deliver to
the Trustee and the Swap Counterparty on or prior to June 30 of each year       
prior to a Trust Termination Event the Officer's Certificate as to compliance   
as required by Section 6.1(b) of the Base Trust Agreement.                      

Section 26. Certain Filing to be Made by the Trustee. In the event
that an event requiring the sale of the Underlying Securities under this        
Agreement occurs and the Underlying Securities are liquidated at a loss, the    
Trustee will disclose pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4 the      
loss in accordance with the procedures of such regulation, unless the Trustee   
obtains advice from counsel that such disclosure is not necessary. In general,  
the Trustee

will (x) attach a completed Form 8886 to its tax return in the year the         
requisite loss occurs and (y) file a completed form with the Office of Tax      
Shelter Analysis (OTSA) at: Internal Revenue Service LM:PFTG:OTSA, Large and    
Midsize Business Division, 1111 Constitution Avenue., NW., Washington DC 20224  
(or such other address subsequently required).                                  

Section 27. Establishment of Accounts. The Securities Intermediary
and the Trustee hereby represent and warrant that:                              

       (a) Each Account for the Trust is a "securities account" within the
meaning of Section 8-501 of the UCC and is held only in the name of the         
Trustee on behalf of the Trust. The Securities Intermediary is acting in the    
capacity of a "securities intermediary" within the meaning of Section           
8-102(a)(14) of the UCC;                                                        

(b) All Underlying Securities have been (i) delivered to the
Securities Intermediary pursuant to the Agreement and (ii) credited to the      
Certificate Account; and                                                        

       (c) Each Account is an account to which financial assets are or may
be credited, and the Securities Intermediary shall treat the Trustee as         
entitled to exercise the rights that comprise any financial asset credited to   
the Accounts.                                                                   

Section 28. Statement of Intent. It is the intention of the parties
hereto that, for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and   
franchise taxes and any other taxes imposed upon, measured by or based upon     
gross or net income, the Trust shall be treated as a grantor trust, but         
failing that, as a partnership (other than a publicly traded partnership        
taxable as a corporation) and, in any event, shall not be classified as a       
corporation. The parties hereto agree that, unless otherwise required by        
appropriate tax authorities, the Trustee shall file or cause to be filed        
annual or other necessary returns, reports and other forms consistent with      
such intended characterization. In the event that the Trust is characterized    
by appropriate tax authorities as a partnership for federal income tax          
purposes, each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of its Certificate, agrees  
to report its respective share of the items of income, deductions, and credits  
of the Trust on its respective returns (making such elections as to individual  
items as may be appropriate) in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section    
1.761-2(b) (the "761 Election") and in a manner consistent with the complete    
exclusion of the Trust from subchapter K of the Code. The terms of the          
Agreement shall be interpreted to further these intentions of the parties. As   
further consideration for each Certificateholder's purchase of a Certificate,   
each such Certificateholder is deemed to agree not to irrevocably delegate to   
any person (for a period of more than one year) authority to purchase, sell or  
exchange its Certificates.                                                      

       Each Certificateholder (and each beneficial owner of a Certificate)
by acceptance of its Certificate (or its beneficial interest therein) agrees,   
unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, to file its own tax   
returns and reports in a manner consistent with the characterization indicated  
above.                                                                          

Section 29. Filing of Partnership Returns. In the event that the
Trust is characterized (by appropriate tax authorities) as a partnership for    
United States federal income tax purposes, and the 761 Election is              
ineffective, the Trustor agrees to reimburse the Trust for any expenses         
associated with the filing of partnership returns (or returns related           
thereto).

 Section 30. "Financial Assets" Election. The Securities Intermediary
hereby agrees that the Underlying Securities credited to the Certificate        
Account and any Posted Collateral credited to the Collateral Account shall be   
treated as a "financial asset" within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of     
the UCC.                                                                        

Section 31. Trustee's Entitlement Orders. If at any time the
Securities Intermediary shall receive any order from the Trustee directing the  
transfer or redemption of any Underlying Securities credited to the Accounts,   
the Securities Intermediary shall comply with such entitlement order without    
further consent by the Trustor or any other Person. The Securities              
Intermediary shall take all instructions (including without limitation all      
notifications and entitlement orders) with respect to the Accounts solely from  
the Trustee.                                                                    

Section 32. Conflict with Other Agreements. The Securities  
Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees that:                                   

(a) There are no other agreements entered into between the  
Securities Intermediary and the Trustor with respect to the Accounts. Each      
Account and all property credited to the Account is not subject to, and the     
Securities Intermediary hereby waives, any lien, security interest, right of    
set off, or encumbrance in favor of the Securities Intermediary or any Person   
claiming through the Securities Intermediary (other than the Trustee);          

 (b) It has not entered into, and until the termination of the
Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with any other Person relating to  
the Accounts and/or any financial assets credited thereto pursuant to which it  
has agreed to comply with entitlement orders of any Person other than the       
Trustee; and                                                                    

 (c) It has not entered into, and until the termination of the
Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with any Person purporting to      
limit or condition the obligation of the Securities Intermediary to comply      
with entitlement orders as set forth in Section 31 hereof.                      

Section 33. Additional Trustee and Securities Intermediary  
Representations. The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each hereby        
represents and warrants as follows:                                             

      (a) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each maintains its

        (b) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each has not granted

subject to any lien on properties of the Trustee or the Securities              
Intermediary in its individual capacity; the Trustee and the Securities         
Intermediary each has no actual knowledge and has not received actual notice    
of any lien on the Underlying Securities (other than any liens of the Trustee   
in favor of the beneficiaries of the Trust Agreement); other than the           
interests of the Trustee, the Certificateholders and the Swap Counterparty,     
the books and records of the Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each do    
not identify any Person as having an interest in the Underlying Securities;     
and                                                                             

 (c) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each makes no
representation as to (i) the validity, legality, sufficiency or enforceability  
of any of the Underlying Securities or (ii) the collectability, insurability,

 Section 34. Additional Trustor Representations. The Trustor hereby
represents and warrants to the Trustee as follows:                              

     (a) Immediately prior to the sale of the Underlying Securities to
the Trustee, the Trustor, as Depositor, owned and had good and marketable       
title to the Underlying Securities free and clear of any lien, claim or         
encumbrance of any Person;                                                      

(b) The Trustor, as Depositor, has received all consents and
approvals required by the terms of the Underlying Securities to the sale to     
the Trustee of its interest and rights in the Underlying Securities as          
contemplated by the Agreement; and

 On any Business Day occurring on or after September 15, 2005,
subject to satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in clause (b), the   
Depositor may exchange Certificates held by it for a distribution of            
Underlying Securities representing the same percentage of the Underlying        
Securities as such Certificates represent of all outstanding Certificates.      

      (a) The following conditions shall apply to any Optional Exchange.

        (A) A notice specifying the number of Certificates being surrendered
  and the optional exchange date shall be delivered to the Trustee no less
than 5 days (or such shorter period acceptable to the Trustee) but not
more than 30 days before the optional exchange date.                  

      (B) Certificates shall be surrendered to the trustee no later than
10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the optional exchange date.        

     (C) The Trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel stating
  that the Optional Exchange would not cause the Trust to be treated as an
 association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes.                                          

 (D) No more than one (1) Optional Exchange shall occur in any
Collection Period.                                                    

  (E) The Trustee shall not be obligated to determine whether an
 Optional Exchange complies with the applicable provisions for exemption
   under Rule 3a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the
rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.                          

       (F) The provisions of Section 4.5 of the Base Trust Agreement shall
not apply to an Optional Exchange pursuant to this Section 39. This   
  Section 39 shall not provide any Person with a lien against, an interest
in or a right to specific performance with respect to the Underlying  
Securities; provided that satisfaction of the conditions set forth in 
this Section 39 shall entitle the Depositor to a distribution thereof.

    (G) The aggregate principal balance of Certificates exchanged in
 connection with any Optional Exchange pursuant to this Section 39 shall
 be in an amount that results in a distribution of Underlying Securities
in an even multiple of the minimum denomination of the Underlying     
Securities.                                                           

18  

P-->EX-4.122nd�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
    (H) No Swap Agreement Termination Event shall have occurred as a
result of the Optional Exchange except to the extent of a termination 
  resulting from the reduction in the Hedge Notional Amount (as defined in
the Swap Agreement) to an amount equal to the principal amount of the 
Underlying Securities after giving effect to the Optional Exchange.   

I(I)        Any payments due under the Swap Agreement as a result of the        
         reduction in such Hedge Notional Amount and any such Swap Agreement
 Termination Event (x) that are due to the Swap Counterparty
        (including but not limited to Unpaid Amounts) shall have been paid
        to the Swap Counterparty by the Depositor and (y) that are payable
       by the Swap Counterparty, shall be payable for the account of the
Depositor.

or for the account of any employee benefit plan, trust or account, including    
an individual retirement account, that is subject to the requirements of Title  
I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or that   
is described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, or by or for the account of     
any entity whose underlying assets include any assets subject to these laws by  
reason of investment in that entity by such plans, trusts or accounts. By       
accepting and holding any Certificate, the holder of the Certificate will be    
deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not a plan or entity        
described above, and that its acquisition and holding of the Certificate are    
in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

   This Certificate is one of the duly authorized Certificates designated as
"STRATS(SM) Certificates, Series 2004-12 (herein called the "Certificate" or

which such Holder is bound. The assets of the Trust include the Underlying      
Securities, all proceeds of the Underlying Securities and the Trust's rights    
under the Swap Agreement.                                                       

Under the Trust Agreement, there shall be distributed on the dates

acknowledges such rights in accordance with the terms of the Series Supplement  
and the Swap Agreement.                                                         

   It is the intent of the Trustor and the Certificateholders that the Trust

of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Except as otherwise required  
by appropriate taxing authorities, the Trustor and the Trustee, by executing    
the Trust Agreement, and each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a             
Certificate, agrees to treat, and to take no action inconsistent with the       
treatment of, the Certificates for such tax purposes as interests in a grantor  
trust and the provisions of the Trust Agreement shall be interpreted to         
further this intention of the parties.

integrate the Underlying Securities and the Swap Agreement for United States    
federal income tax purposes, (2) authorizes and directs the trustee (or the     
trustee's agent) to retain, as part of the Certificateholder's books and

"synthetic" debt instrument and (3) agrees to retain copies of such             
information as provided to the Certificateholder by the Trust.                  

   Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Certificate, covenants and
agrees that such Certificateholder shall not, prior to the date which is one    
year and one day after the termination of the Trust Agreement, acquiesce,       
petition or otherwise invoke or cause the Trustor to invoke the process of any  
court or governmental authority for the purpose of commencing or sustaining a   
case against the Trustor under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency,     
reorganization or similar law or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee,   
trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the Trustor or    
any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or             
liquidation of the affairs of the Trustor.

benefit plan, trust or account, including an individual retirement account,

Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or that is described in Section        
4975(e)(1) of the Code, or by or for the account of any entity whose            
underlying assets include any assets subject to these laws by reason of         
investment in that entity by such plans, trusts or accounts. By accepting and   
holding this Certificate, the holder of this Certificate will be deemed to      
have represented and warranted that it is not a plan or entity described

compliance with the foregoing restrictions.                                     

The Trust Agreement permits the amendment thereof, in certain         
circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.   

  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed
by an authorized officer of the Trustee by manual signature, this Certificate   
shall not entitle the Holder hereof to any benefit under the Trust Agreement

MASTER AGREEMENT  

dated as of September 9, 2004 

WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL                and  STRATS(SM) TRUST FOR MORGAN STANLEY 
ASSOCIATION                                 SECURITIES, SERIES 2004-12          

have entered and/or anticipate entering into one of more transactions (each a   
"Transaction") that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which     
includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming  
evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties confirming       
those Transactions.                                                             

Accordingly, the parties agree as follows: --                                   

1.   Interpretation                                                             

(a)  Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will      
have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.   

(b)  Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions    
of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the          
Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the            
provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the         
Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant       
Transaction.                                                                    

(c)  Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the     
fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement   
between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the     
parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.                        

2.   Obligations                                                                

(a)  General Conditions.                                                        

(i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each 
  Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement.                                                          

(ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for 
    value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant
Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely     
transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the  
   required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than
  by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in
the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise   
  specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

   (iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to
   (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event
of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is      

D-1-1   

P-->EX-4.132nd�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
  continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date
   in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively
  designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified
in this Agreement.                                                  

(b)   Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a    
payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local     
Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which  
such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a            
reasonable objection to such change.                                            

(c)   Netting. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable: --            

(i) in the same currency; and                                       

(ii) in respect of the same Transaction,                            

by each party to the other. then, on such date, each party's obligation to      
make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged  
and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one      
party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by    
the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger    
aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess   
of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.               

The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount  
will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the    
same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such       
amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be     
made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii)     
above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the     
election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii)      
above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date).   
This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and   
will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties      
make and receive payments or deliveries.                                        

(d)  Deduction or Withholding for Tax.                                          

    (i)   Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any
deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such     
 deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified
 by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in
  effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party
("X") will: --                                                        

    (1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;

        (2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be
    deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be
    deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y
       under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining
        that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice
that such amount has been assessed against Y;             

   (3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified
copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, 
evidencing such payment to such authorities; and          

       (4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to
        the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement,
   such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net
    amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable
         Taxes. whether assessed against X or Y) will equal ft full amount Y
   would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
     required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional
        amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid
but for: --                                               

            (A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement
   contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or

         (B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to
              Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would
          not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing
              authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on
or after the date on which a                    

D-1-2   

P-->EX-4.133rd�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
              Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action
              is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement)
or (II) a Change in Tax Law.                    

(ii)  Liability. If: --                                               

 (1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
      practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make
     any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be
         required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);

(2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and                 

  (3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly
against X,                                                

      then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the
     liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the
   amount of such liability (including any related liability for
         interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if
       Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in
Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).                      

(e)  Default Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective      
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant             
Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment            
obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c),    
be required to pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue   
amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue        
amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment   
to (but excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such        
interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual    
number of days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation    
of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party    
defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by         
delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent     
provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.       

3.   Representations                                                            

Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed  
to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered     
into and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times      
until the termination of this Agreement) that: --

Each party agrees with the other that, so long as either party has or may have  
any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to     
which it is a party: --                                                         

(a)  Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in   
certain cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing      
authority as the other party reasonably directs: --                             

 (i) any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified
in the Schedule or any Confirmation;                                  

 (ii) any other documents specified in the Schedule of any Confirmation;
and                                                                   

(iii) upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document
   that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow
 such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under
this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any  
deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such    
deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion,
execution or submission of such form or document would not materially

   such demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed
in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be     
  executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification,

in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if  
none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.                           

(b)  Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain    
in full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority    
that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any    
Credit Support Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable      
efforts to obtain any that may become necessary in the future.                  

(c)  Comply with Laws. It will comply in all material respects with all         
applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply   
would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this       
Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.                

(d)  Tax Agreement. It will give notice of any failure of a representation made 
by it under Section 3(f) to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of      
such failure.

D-1-6   

P-->EX-4.137th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional   
Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to (v) below:--            

  (i) Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable
  law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the
promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court,   
tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any   
applicable law after such date. it becomes unlawful (other than as a  
result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which
will be the Affected Party):--                                        

    (1) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a
        payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect
        of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision
of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or        

         (2) to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to
     perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or
         such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document
relating to such Transaction;                             

(ii) Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or 
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on 
   which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is
taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a  
  Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or
there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding
Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an   
additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section    
   2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or
6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be 
deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of 
 interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount
is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4)
(other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));               

   (iii) Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the next
 succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an
additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section    
   2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or
  6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or
 withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which
 the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than
   by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of
 a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or
transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity   
  (which will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute
an event described in Section 5(a)(viii);                             

   (iv) Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified
in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"), any Credit
Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X         
consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers
all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action
does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the  
creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is  
materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such
Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action
(and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate,
will be the Affected Party); or                                       

 (v) Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination Event"
is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying. the     
occurrence of such event (and, in such event. the Affected Party or   
Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination
Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).                          

(j)  Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which would   
otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an    
Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an      
Event of Default.

6.   Early Termination                                                          

(a)  Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of  
Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is    
then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more  
than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of    
Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as   
an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If,       
however, "Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as          
applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all           
outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with        
respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section               
5(a)(vii)(l), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as    
of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding    
or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect   
to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to   
the extent analogous thereto, (8).                                              

(b)  Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.                            

(i) Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will,    
promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying
the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and
   will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the
other party may reasonably require.                                   

 (ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under
 Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected
   Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the
 Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to
designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all   
reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss,
excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days 
after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and        
  obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions
to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event
ceases to exist.                                                      

If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give
notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period,   
   whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after
the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).                            

  Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject
to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, 
which consent will not be withheld if such other party's policies in  
 effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the
transferee on the terms proposed.                                     

  (iii) Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or
a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will
   use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice
thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that        
Termination Event.                                                    

(iv) Right to Terminate. If:--                                        

         (1) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section
       6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect
         to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party
gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or                    

     (2) an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon
      Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event
   Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected
Party,                                                    

   either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case
   of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event
or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected 
Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a  
 Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is
   only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other
party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then        

D-1-8   

P-->EX-4.139th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�39th
continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is   
effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected     
Transactions.                                                         

(c)  Effect of Designation.                                                     

(i) If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under    
   Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so
 designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination
Event is then continuing.                                             

   (ii) Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination
  Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in
 respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but
  without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount,
if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be      
determined pursuant to Section 6(e).                                  

(d)  Calculations.                                                              

(i) Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the  
occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the     
 calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will
   provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail,
 such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any
   amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant
 account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence
of written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in    
 determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining such
quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of
such quotation.                                                       

(ii) Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any
   Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that
notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early    
   Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of
   Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on
  which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early
   Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event).
Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under 
applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in
the Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early     
  Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the
 Applicable Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily
compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.                    

(e)  Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the    
following provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the          
Schedule of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss", and a       
payment method, either the "First Method" or the "Second Method". If the        
parties fail to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule,  
it will be deemed that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case   
may be, shall apply. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early         
Termination Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to     
any Set-off.                                                                    

(i) Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an  
Event of Default:--                                                   

    (1) First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and
  Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the
       Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the
    sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting
Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the  
        Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
       Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent
of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.      

        (2) First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the
 Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a
         positive number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this
Agreement.                                                

      (3) Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and
        Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the
sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the           

D-1-9   

P-->EX-4.140th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
         Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and
        the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to
the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination Currency
        Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If
        that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it
  to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the
        Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to
the Defaulting Party.                                     

         (4) Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an
        amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in
         respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the
        Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is
       a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute
value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.             

(ii) Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a 
Termination Event:--                                                  

        (1) One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the amount
       payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3),
 if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss
        applies, except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting
Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be
     references to the Affected Party and the party which is not the
       Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than
         all the Transactions are being terminated, Loss shall be calculated
in respect of all Terminated Transactions.                

    (2) Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:--

          (A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a
          Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions,
       and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a)
             one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of the
   party with the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the
             Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount
             ("Y") and (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid
   Amounts owing to X less (II) the Termination Currency
Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and  

        (B) if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in
  respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the
             Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated
           Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half
             of the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher
             Loss ("X") and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").

             If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X;
          if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of
that amount to Y.                                 

(iii) Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early      
  Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in
   respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be
subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to
 reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under
  this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from
the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined
under Section 6(d)(ii).                                               

  (iv) Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an
 amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate
   of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain
 and the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise
  provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any
additional damages as a consequence of such losses.                   

7.   Transfer                                                                   

Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or         
obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of     
security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of     
the other party, except that:--                                                 

D-1-10  

P-->EX-4.141st�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
(a)  a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a           
consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all  
or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to    
any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and                            

(b)  a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in     
any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).            

Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be      
void.                                                                           

8.   Contractual Currency                                                       

(a)  Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement     
will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that      
payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable     
law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual    
Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency      
other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results   
in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a        
reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered      
into the Contractual Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency   
of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the      
amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in     
the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party        
required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law,   
immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be    
necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the  
Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual          
Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment  
will refund promptly the amount of such excess.                                 

(b)  Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or   
order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered   
(i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for  
the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this  
Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the   
payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking         
recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party    
is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive      
immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the             
Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in    
such other currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of   
the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid   
in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from  
any variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency    
is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of     
such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able,    
acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency      
received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency    
with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by   
such party. The term "rate of exchange" includes, without limitation, any       
premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or    
conversion into the Contractual Currency.                                       

(c)  Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these     
indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other      
obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent  
causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the      
party to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being   
obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of  
this Agreement.                                                                 

(d)  Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient 
for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual     
exchange or purchase been made.

9.   Miscellaneous                                                              

(a)  Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and      
understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes  
all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.                 

(b)  Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this        
Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced    
by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed   
by an exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging     
system.                                                                         

(c)  Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and       
6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the  
termination of any Transaction.                                                 

(d)  Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights,     
powers, remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and   
not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.   

(e)  Counterparts and Confirmations.                                            

(i) This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in    
 respect of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including
by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original. 

  (ii) The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each
  Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or
 otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable
   and may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile
 transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange
 of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system, which in each
   case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding supplement
to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another
effective means that any such counterpart, telex or electronic message
constitutes a Confirmation.                                           

(f)  No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or  
privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a     
waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will  
not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right,  
power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.      

(g)  Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of       
reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into    
consideration in interpreting this Agreement.                                   

10.  Offices; Multibranch Parties                                               

(a)  If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party      
that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home    
office represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of         
booking office or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party,  
the obligations of such party are the same as if it had entered into the        
Transaction through its head or home office. This representation will be        
deemed to be repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is      
entered into.                                                                   

(b)  Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives    
payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior       
written consent of the other party.                                             

(c)  If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such       
Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any         
Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through   
which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a            
Transaction will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.                     

11.  Expenses                                                                   

A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other       
party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal    
fees and Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement   
and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support         
Document

of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection.

(a)  Effectiveness. Any notice or other communication in respect of this        
Agreement may be given in any manner set forth below (except that a notice or

transmission or electronic messaging system) to the address or number or in     
accordance with the electronic messaging system details provided (see the       
Schedule) and will be deemed effective as indicated:--

is delivered;                                                         

(ii) if sent by telex, on the date the recipient's answerback is

   (iii) if sent by facsimile transmission, on the date that transmission is
 received by a responsible employee of the recipient in legible form (it
   being agreed that the burden of proving receipt will be on the sender and
will not be met by a transmission report generated by the sender's    
facsimile machine);                                                   

(iv) if sent by certified or registered mail (airmail, if overseas) or

delivered or its delivery is attempted; or                            

 (v) if sent by electronic messaging system, on the date that electronic
message is received,                                                  

unless the date of that delivery (or attempted delivery) or that receipt as     
applicable, is not a Local Business Day or that communication is delivered (or  
attempted) or received, as applicable, after the close of business on a Local   
Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed given and        
effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.              

(b)  Change of Addresses. Either party may by notice to the other change the    
address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at    
which notices or other communications are to be given to it.                    

13.  Governing Law and Jurisdiction                                             

(a)  Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in         
accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.                              

(b)  Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to  
this Agreement ("Proceedings"), each party irrevocably:--                       

  (i) submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement
is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive   
   jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States
 District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if
this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of
New York; and                                                         

  (ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of
   venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that
 such Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and further
 waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such
court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.                 

Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in   
any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed  
by English law, the Contracting States, as defined in Section 1(3) of the       
Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or     
re-enactment thereof for the time being in force) nor will the bringing of      
Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of           
Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.

(c)  Service of Process. Each party irrevocably appoints the Process Agent (if  
any) specified opposite its name in the Schedule to receive, for it and on its  
behalf, service of process in any Proceedings. If for any reason any party's    
Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the     
other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable    
to the other party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process       
given in the manner provided for notices in Section 12. Nothing in this         
Agreement will affect the right of either party to serve process in any other   
manner permitted by law.                                                        

(d)  Waiver of Immunities. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable law, with respect to itself and its revenues and        
assets (irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the         
grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii)             
jurisdiction of any court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for         
specific performance or for recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its        
assets (whether before or after judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of   
any judgment to which it or its revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled  
in any Proceedings in the courts of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees,    
to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will not claim any such      
immunity in any Proceedings.                                                    

14.  Definitions

"Loss" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated          
Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency         
Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith to be    
its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative      
number) in connection with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or     
group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any loss of     
bargain, cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without          
duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating,              
liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position  
(or any gain resulting from any of them). Loss includes losses and costs (or    
gains) in respect of any payment or delivery required to have been made         
(assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) on or before     
the relevant Early Termination Date and not made, except, so as to avoid        
duplication, if Section 6(e)(i)(1) or (3) or 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) applies. Loss does  
not include a party's legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under   
Section 11. A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early            
Termination Date, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as of the          
earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable. A party may (but need    
not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices  
from one or more leading dealers in the relevant markets.                       

"Market Quotation" means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions   
and a party making the determination, an amount determined on the basis of      
quotations from Reference Market-makers. Each quotation will be for an amount,  
if any, that would be paid to such party (expressed as a negative number) or    
by such party (expressed as a positive number) in consideration of an           
agreement between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support   
Document with respect to the obligations of such party) and the quoting         
Reference Market-maker to enter into a transaction (the "Replacement            
Transaction") that would have the effect of preserving for such party the       
economic equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether                         

D-1-15  

P-->EX-4.146th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�46th
the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the           
satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) by the parties under       
Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of           
Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the relevant      
Early Termination Date, have been required after that date. For this purpose,   
Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated  
Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any payment or         
delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been     
required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after   
that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction      
would be subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference          
Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or  
its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation    
to the extent reasonably practicable as of the same day and time (without       
regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after   
the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of which those         
quotations are to be obtained will be selected in good faith by the party       
obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is so    
obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are   
provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations,   
without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values, If       
exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the    
quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For   
this purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest   
value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three    
quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in         
respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions      
cannot be determined.                                                           

"Non-default Rate" means a rate per annum equal to the cost (without proof or   
evidence of any actual cost) to the Non-defaulting Party (as certified by it)   
if it were to fund the relevant amount.

to make an extension of credit and (b) to the extent practicable, from among

   Bankruptcy within the meaning of clause (2) thereof with respect to Party
B; and

   writing that it will not downgrade, reduce, suspend or withdraw
   S&P's then-current rating on the Certificates if this Agreement
     remains in full force and effect with respect to each transaction
       hereunder. Party A shall notify Party B within one (1) Business Day

(C)  The Certificates become due and payable prior to their final     
scheduled maturity date for any reason;                     

  (D)  Party B fails to comply with sub-paragraph (e)(i) of Part 6 of this
    Schedule; any prepayment, redemption, retirement, liquidation or
       distribution of the Underlying Securities (including as a result of
      a Payment Default, an Acceleration or an SEC Reporting Failure) or
   other prepayment in full of all Certificates outstanding occurs

        of the Underlying Securities is not capable of being rescinded); any
      Trust Termination Event (as defined in the Trust Agreement) occurs

  any action or exercises any rights or remedies under the Trust

  (E)  Party B fails to comply with sub-paragraph (j)(i) of Part 1 of this
        Schedule, or any Additional Termination Event occurs under paragraph
       (j) of Part 1 of this Schedule in either event to the extent of the
       applicable Affected Notional Amount as described in that paragraph.

   (ii) For purposes of the right to terminate under Section 6(b)(iv), Party
A will be the sole Affected Party for any Additional Termination Event
described in clause (A) or (B) of sub-paragraph (i) above, and Party B

Event.                                                                

(iii) Notwithstanding which party is the Affected Party for any       
   Additional Termination Event, upon the occurrence of an Early Termination
 Date for any Additional Termination Event under this Part 1(i), Party A
shall make the calculations under Section 6(e) of this Agreement as   
   though it were the non-Affected Party for purposes of Section 6(e)(ii)(1)
of this Agreement.                                                    

(iv) "Hedge Counterparty Required Rating" means, as applicable, at any
   time that any Certificates outstanding under the Trust Agreement and have
 a long-term rating of at least A by S&P, with respect to a Person as an
   issuer or with respect to long-term senior unsecured debt of such Person,
BBB- by S&P (for so long as any Certificates are outstanding under the
   Trust Agreement and are rated by S&P); provided that should S&P effect an
  overall downward adjustment of its short-term or long-term ratings, then
the applicable Hedge Counterparty Required Rating shall be downwardly 
 adjusted accordingly; provided further, that any adjustment to a rating
shall be subject to the prior written consent of S&P.                 

   (v) "Hedge Counterparty Collateral Threshold Rating" mean, so long as any
 Certificates are outstanding under the Trust Agreement and are rated by
S&P:                                                                  

 (A)  if the actual long-term rating assigned by S&P with respect to the
        Certificates outstanding under the Trust Agreement (in the event S&P
   has assigned more than one long-term rating with respect to the
   Certificates, then the applicable long-term rating shall be the
        highest of such long-term ratings) (the "Actual Certificate Rating")
is "AA-" or above, "A" with respect to the long-term senior 
        unsecured debt of Party A (so long as the short-term debt of Party A
  is rated at least "A-1") or "A+" with respect to the long-term
      senior unsecured debt of Party A (if Party A has a short-term debt
    rating below "A-1" or does not have a short-term debt rating) in
each case, by S&P;

    to the long-term senior unsecured debt of Party A and "A-2" with
        respect to the short-term debt of Party A, in each case, by S&P; and

(C)  if the Actual Certificate Rating is "A-" or below, then the Hedge
Counterparty Collateral Threshold Rating shall be the Actual
Certificate Rating;                                         

     provided that should S&P effect an overall downward adjustment of

     reasonably acceptable to S&P and for which S&P confirms in writing that
 such support will not cause the reduction or withdrawal of its then
     current rating of any outstanding class of Certificates under the Trust
Agreement with respect to which it has previously issued a rating.

(vii)  "S&P" means, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The       
McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P") (so long as any Certificates deemed

(j)    Mandatory Reduction Events. To protect Party A's interest in the Trust   
   Agreement as a source of payment for Party B's obligations hereunder,
     including the priority of those payments under the Trust Agreement, the
following provisions shall apply with respect to all Transactions 
hereunder:                                                        

 (i) If either (x) without the prior written consent of Party A, Party B
  enters into any "Hedge Agreement" (as defined in the Trust Agreement) on
any date (a "Principal Payment Date") with any person or entity that  
would result in the Hedge Notional Amount exceeding the remaining     
Principal Balance on any date or (y) as the result of any payment,    
repayment, retirement or redemption of any amount of the Principal    
Balance under the Trust Agreement on any date (a "Principal Payment   
Date"), (A) the Principal Balance would be reduced to zero, or (B) the
   Hedge Notional Amount would exceed the remaining Principal Balance (after
  giving effect to that repayment), (each, a "Mandatory Reduction Event"),
then not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date        
("Mandatory Reduction Date") which is the second New York Business Day
prior to that Principal Payment Date, Party B shall:                  

        (1)  notify Party A of that Mandatory Reduction Event, including the
            amount to be repaid and the outstanding Hedge Notional Amount;
and                                               

      (2)  specify in that notice each outstanding Transaction hereunder
     and the corresponding amount by which the Transactional
           Notional Amount of that Transaction is to be reduced for that
            Mandatory Reduction Event ("Affected Notional Amount") so that
the Hedge Notional Amount for any                 

D-2-4   

P-->EX-4.153rd�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�53rd
         date (after giving effect to all such reductions) would not
             exceed the Principal Balance for that date (after giving effect
        to any repayment) (except that if the Principal Balance is
            reduced to zero, the Hedge Notional Amount shall be reduced to
zero).                                            

    "Hedge Notional Amount" means, as of the date of determination, an
   amount equal to the aggregate Notional Amount outstanding on that
date and for the then current Calculation Period of all       
   Transactions outstanding under any Hedge Agreement (as defined in
the Trust Agreement) then in effect.                          

 "Principal Balance" means, on any date, the aggregate principal
   amount of the Certificates, outstanding under the Trust Agreement
   on that date, after giving effect to all repayments, redemptions,
advances or distributions of principal thereon on that date.  

(ii) For each Transaction for which a corresponding Affected Notional 
Amount is specified ("Affected Transaction") pursuant to sub-paragraph
(i) above, the Notional Amount of that Affected Transaction shall be  
reduced as of the Mandatory Reduction Date by an amount equal to the  
  Affected Notional Amount (and, if the Notional Amount otherwise accretes
or amortizes after the Mandatory Reduction Date, the effect of that   
  reduction shall be to reduce proportionately the Notional Amount of each
future Calculation Period remaining under the Transaction), and an    
 Additional Termination Event and Early Termination Date shall be deemed
   to have occurred on the Mandatory Reduction Date for that Transaction and
Party B will be the sole Affected Party. For purposes of such Early   
Termination Date, the term "Terminated Transaction" as used in Section
6(e) of this Agreement shall be only that part of the Affected        
 Transaction relating to the Affected Notional Amount, and the remainder
  of the Affected Transaction shall continue in full force and effect as a
  Transaction hereunder subject to the terms of this Agreement. The amount
payable under Section 6(e) of this Agreement with respect to any such 
 Early Termination Date shall be due and payable in accordance with such
  Section 6(e), provided that such payment shall be made no later than the
next "Distribution Date" under the Trust Agreement to occur after the 
  Mandatory Reduction Date, and provided further that the Market Quotation
  with respect to any Terminated Transaction under this sub-paragraph (ii)
shall be determined on the basis of the quotation of one Reference    
  Market-maker selected by Party A, which may be Party A to the extent its
quotation is reasonably determined in good faith.                     

(k)  Events of Default. An Event of Default shall not occur with respect to     
Party A under Section 5(a)(v)(1) or (2) or Section 5(a)(vi) when the  
failure to pay or deliver, or the default, event of default or other  
  similar condition or event, as the case may be, arises solely (i) out of
a wire transfer problem or an operational or administrative error or  
   omission (so long as the required funds or property required to make that
payment or delivery were otherwise available to Party A), or (ii) from
the general unavailability of the relevant currency due to exchange   
   controls or other similar governmental action, but in either case only if
the payment or delivery is made within three Local Business Days after
   the problem has been corrected, the error or omission has been discovered
or the currency becomes generally available.

   day" and to add the following language immediately after the word "party"
  at the end of the third line of such subsection "provided, however, such

   Certificates as of the end of such month and the Hedge Notional Amount as
   of the end of such month and each following month during the term of this
Agreement for all outstanding Transactions under all Hedge Agreements

If, on the related Valuation Date, the highest rated Certificates are 
rated "A-" or below by S&P, then the Volatility Buffer will be determined in    
consultation with S&P and will be at such levels as may be required in order    
for S&P to agree in writing that it will not downgrade, reduce, suspend or      
withdraw S&P's then-current rating on the Certificates; provided, however, in   
no event shall such Volatility Buffer levels exceed the levels set forth in     
the table set forth

This information is retained on behalf of each Certificateholder and is         
intended to comply with requirements imposed by Section 1.1275-6(e) of the      
United States Treasury Regulations.

expected to be issued or acquired) by the taxpayer and the date the   
Section 1.1275-6 hedge was entered into by the taxpayer.              

The Trust acquired the qualifying debt instrument on September 9, 2004

  Certificateholder simultaneously acquires its interest in the qualifying
 debt instrument and enters into the Section 1.1275-6 hedge on the trade
date identified in the trade confirmation for the purchase of         
Certificates.

(including a schedule and credit support annex thereto) dated as of   
   September 9, 2004 and as supplemented by a confirmation number 447612 and
447674 in the form attached to this series supplement as Exhibit D.   

  (3) A summary of the cash flows and accruals resulting from treating the
qualifying debt instrument and the Section 1.1275-6 hedge as an       
integrated transaction (that is, the cash flows and accruals on the   
synthetic debt instrument).

and this Series Supplement. The Stated
Amount of the Certificates shall equal
100% of the initial principal amount of
Underlying Securities sold to the
Trustee and deposited in the Trust. Such
Stated Amount shall be calculated
without regard to Certificates
authenticated and delivered upon registration
of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in
lieu of, other Certificates pursuant
to Sections 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5 of the Base
Trust Agreement.

the
Certificates will be made in the Specified

Section 8. Swap Payments; Collateral Account. (a) The Trust
shall
pay to the Swap Counterparty (i) for so
long as the Swap Agreement shall not
have been terminated, an amount equal to
all interest payments payable on the
Underlying Securities on each Underlying
Securities Payment Date or on any
other date on which such amounts are
received by the Trust, excluding any
amount of interest that accrued with
respect to the Underlying Securities from
the Underlying Securities Payment Date
immediately preceding the Closing Date
to, but excluding, the Closing Date and
(ii) all other amounts owing to the
Swap Counterparty under the Swap Agreement
to the extent Trust assets are
sufficient therefor, including but not
limited to all Unpaid Amounts upon the
occurrence of any Swap Agreement
Termination Event
 
           
(b) The Trustee shall within 3 Business Days of the Closing
Date
establish the Collateral Account. Any and
all amounts at any time on deposit
in the Collateral Account shall be held in
trust by the Trustee for the
benefit of Certificateholders and the Swap
Counterparty; provided, that, the
only permitted withdrawal from or
application of funds on deposit in, or
otherwise to the credit of, the Collateral
Account shall be (i) for
application to obligations of the Swap
Counterparty to the Trust under the
Swap Agreement in accordance with the terms
of the Swap Agreement or (ii) to
return Posted Collateral to the Swap
Counterparty when and as required by the
Swap Agreement, which the Trustee shall
return to the Swap Counterparty in
accordance with the related Swap
Agreement.
 
            
Section 9. Certain Provisions of Base Trust Agreement Not
Applicable. The provisions of Sections
5.11, 5.16, 6.2, Article VII, 8.1, 8.2
and 8.10 of the Base Trust Agreement and
any other provision of the Base Trust
Agreement which imposes obligations on or
creates rights in favor of the
Trustee or the Certificateholders as a
result of or in connection with an
"Event of Default" or "Administrative Agent
Termination Event" shall be
inapplicable with respect to the
Certificates. In addition, there is no
"Administrative Agent" specified herein,
and all references to "Administrative
Agent" in the Base Trust Agreement,
therefore shall be inapplicable with
respect to the Certificates.
 
           
Section 10. Distributions. (a) On each Distribution Date, so
long
as no Swap Agreement Termination Event has
occurred for which the Trust is the
Defaulting Party or an Affected Party, the
Trustee shall distribute to the
Certificateholders the Interest
Collections. On the Maturity Date, and to the
extent received on any other Scheduled
Distribution Date, so long as no Swap
Agreement Termination Event has occurred
for which the Trust is the Defaulting
Party or an Affected Party, the Trustee
shall distribute to the
Certificateholders, the principal amount of
the Underlying Securities to the
extent the principal of the Underlying
Securities is received by the Trustee
on such date or during the related
Collection Period plus any accrued interest
thereon.
 
           
(b) If a Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred for
which
the Trust is the Defaulting Party or an
Affected Party the Trustee, first,
shall distribute all collections received
on the Underlying Securities to the
Swap Counterparty until all amounts owing
to the Swap Counterparty under the
Swap Agreement for payments in connection
with such Swap Agreement Termination
Event (including any Unpaid Amounts) have
been paid in full and, second, shall
distribute all remaining amounts to the
Certificateholders. If the
distribution in the preceding sentence is
insufficient to pay in full all
amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty, the
Trustee shall proceed to liquidate
or distribute the Underlying Securities in
accordance with
 
 
 
                                     
7
<PAGE>
 
Section 10(h). Upon any liquidation of the
Underlying Securities, the Trustee,
first, shall distribute the proceeds
thereof to the Swap Counterparty until
all amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty
have been paid in full and, second,
shall distribute all remaining amounts to
the Certificateholders. In the event
of a Swap Agreement Termination Event,
after paying all amounts due to the
Swap Counterparty as set forth in the first
sentence of this Section 10(b), if
no Trust Termination Event has occurred,
all Interest Collections shall
thereafter be distributed to
Certificateholders on each applicable
Distribution Date. If a Swap Agreement
Termination Event has occurred for
which the Swap Counterparty is the
Defaulting Party or the only Affected
Party, notwithstanding the termination of
the Swap Agreement, the Trustee
shall distribute any Unpaid Amounts to the
Swap Counterparty from Interest
Collections on the Underlying
Securities.
 
           
(c) In all cases hereunder, if any payment with respect to the
Underlying Securities is made to the
Trustee after the Underlying Securities
Payment Date on which such payment was due,
the Trustee shall distribute such
amount received on the Business Day
following such receipt.
 
           
(d) In the event of a Payment Default while the Swap Agreement
is
in effect and if any payment is due to the
Swap Counterparty, the Underlying
Securities will be liquidated in accordance
with Section 10(h). Otherwise, in
the event of a Payment Default, the Trustee
shall proceed against the
Underlying Securities Issuer on behalf of
the Certificateholders to enforce
the Underlying Securities or otherwise to
protect the interests of the
Certificateholders, subject to the receipt
of indemnity in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee; provided, that
Holders of the Certificates
representing a majority of the Voting
Rights on the Certificates will be
entitled to direct the Trustee in any such
proceeding or direct the Trustee to
sell the Underlying Securities, subject to
the Trustee's receipt of
satisfactory indemnity.
 
      
      (e) In the
event of an Acceleration and a corresponding payment on
the Underlying Securities prior to any
liquidation of the Underlying
Securities hereunder, the Trustee shall
distribute the proceeds to the
Certificateholders no later than two (2)
Business Days after the receipt of
immediately available funds pursuant to
Section 10(b).
 
           
(f) In the event the Trustee receives property other than cash
in
respect of the Underlying Securities such
property will be applied first, to
the Swap Counterparty until all amounts
owing to the Swap Counterparty have
been paid in full and, second, to the
Certificateholders. Property other than
cash will be liquidated by the Trustee, and
the proceeds thereof distributed
in cash, to the extent necessary to pay to
the Swap Counterparty all amounts
owed to it under the Swap Agreement and,
thereafter, to the extent necessary
to avoid distribution of fractional
securities to Certificateholders. In-kind
distribution of Underlying Securities or
other property to Certificateholders
will be deemed to reduce the Stated Amount
of Certificates on a proportionate
basis. Following such in-kind distribution,
all Certificates will be
cancelled. No amounts will be distributed
to the Trustor in respect of the
Underlying Securities. The Swap
Counterparty shall direct the Trustee with
respect to any liquidation of such property
to the extent of the full amount
owed to it under the Swap Agreement.
 
           
(g) If an SEC Reporting Failure occurs, then the Trustor shall
promptly notify the Trustee, the Swap
Counterparty and the Rating Agency of
such SEC Reporting Failure and
 
 
 
                                     
8
<PAGE>
 
the Trustee shall proceed to liquidate or
distribute the Underlying Securities
in accordance with Section 10(h).
 
           
(h) If at any time, the Trustee is directed to sell the
Underlying
Securities, the Trustee shall solicit bids
for the sale of the Underlying
Securities with settlement thereof on or
before the third (3rd) Business Day
after such sale from three leading dealers
in the relevant market, which may
include but is not limited to any three of
the following dealers: (1) Wachovia
Securities, (2) Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
(3) Lehman Brothers Inc., (4) Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated, (5) Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
(6) J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and (7)
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.;
provided, however, that no bid from
Wachovia Securities or any affiliate
thereof shall be accepted unless such bid
equals the then fair market value of
such Underlying Securities. The Trustee
shall not be responsible for the
failure to obtain a bid so long as it has
made reasonable efforts to obtain
bids. If a bid for the sale of the
Underlying Securities has been accepted by
the Trustee but the sale has failed to
settle on the proposed settlement date,
the Trustee shall request new bids from
such leading dealers. In any
circumstance in which the sale of the
Underlying Securities is required
hereunder, the Trustee shall, to the extent
it is so directed by the Trustor,
provide Certificateholders with the option
to elect to receive an "in-kind"
distribution of their pro rata share of the
Underlying Securities; provided,
that, (1) an in-kind distribution shall be
subject to the prior sale of
Underlying Securities in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 10(h)
to the extent necessary, to pay any amounts
owing to the Swap Counterparty
under Section 10(b), (2) a
Certificateholders' pro rata share of the
Underlying Securities shall be a principal
amount of Underlying Securities
equal to the aggregate principal amount of
the Underlying Securities
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the Stated Amount of that
holder's Certificates and the denominator
of which is the aggregate principal
amount of the Underlying Securities minus
the amount required to be
distributed to the Swap Counterparty
pursuant to the second sentence of
Section 10(b) and (3) odd-lot amounts that
cannot be distributed in-kind
because they are not within the authorized
denominations of the Underlying
Securities shall be distributed in cash.
Any such in-kind distribution shall
constitute the final distribution in
respect of the Certificates as to which
such option is exercised.
 
           
(i) Distributions to the Certificateholders on each
Distribution
Date will be made to the Certificateholders
of record on the Record Date.
 
           
(j) All distributions to Certificateholders shall be allocated
pro
rata among the Certificates based on their
respective Outstanding Amounts as
of the Record Date.
 
           
(k) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent funds are
available, the Trustee will initiate payment
in immediately available funds by 1:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on each
Distribution Date of all amounts payable to
each Certificateholder with
respect to any Certificate held by such
Certificateholder or its nominee
(without the necessity for any presentation
or surrender thereof or any
notation of such payment thereon) in the
manner and at the address as each
Certificateholder may from time to time
direct the Trustee in writing 15 days
prior to such Distribution Date requesting
that such payment will be so made
and designating the bank account to which
such payments shall be so made. The
Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the
last instruction delivered by the
Certificateholder pursuant to this Section
10(f) unless a new instruction is
delivered 15 days prior to a Distribution
Date.

<PAGE>
 
            
(l) The rights of the Certificateholders to receive
distributions
in respect of the Certificates, and all
interests of the Certificateholders in
such distributions, shall be as set forth
in this Series Supplement. The
Trustee shall in no way be responsible or
liable to the Certificateholders nor
shall any Certificateholder in any way be
responsible or liable to any other
Certificateholder in respect of amounts
previously distributed on the
Certificates based on their respective
Outstanding Amounts.
 
           
Section 11. Termination of Trust. (a) The Trust shall terminate
upon the occurrence of any Trust
Termination Event.
 
           
(b) Except for any reports and other information required to be
provided to Certificateholders hereunder
and under the Base Trust Agreement
and except as otherwise specified herein
and therein, the obligations of the
Trustee will terminate upon the
distribution to the Swap Counterparty and
Certificateholders of all amounts required
to be distributed to them and the
disposition of all Underlying Securities
held by the Trustee. The Trust shall
thereupon terminate, except for surviving
rights of indemnity.
 
           
Section 12. Limitation of Powers and Duties. (a) The Trustee
shall
administer the Trust and the Underlying
Securities solely as specified herein
and in the Base Trust Agreement.
 
           
(b) The Trust is constituted solely for the purpose of
acquiring
and holding the Underlying Securities,
entering into and performing its
obligations under the Swap Agreement and
issuing the Certificates. The Trustee
is not authorized to acquire any other
investments or engage in any activities
not authorized herein and, in particular,
unless expressly provided in the
Agreement, the Trustee is not authorized
(i) to sell, assign, transfer,
exchange, pledge, set-off or otherwise
dispose of any of the Underlying
Securities, once acquired, or interests
therein, including to
Certificateholders, (ii) to merge or
consolidate the Trust with any other
entity, or (iii) to do anything that would
materially increase the likelihood
that the Trust will fail to qualify as a
grantor trust for United States
federal income tax purposes. In addition,
the Trustee has no power to create,
assume or incur indebtedness or other
liabilities in the name of the Trust
other than as contemplated herein and in
the Base Trust Agreement.
 
           
(c) The parties acknowledge that the Trustee, as the holder of
the
Underlying Securities, has the right to
vote and give consents and waivers in
respect of the Underlying Securities and
enforce the other rights, if any, of
a holder of the Underlying Securities,
except as otherwise limited by the Base
Trust Agreement or this Series Supplement.
In the event that the Trustee
receives a request from the Underlying
Securities Trustee, the Underlying
Securities Issuer or, if applicable, the
Depositary with respect to the
Underlying Securities, for the Trustee's
consent to any amendment,
modification or waiver of the Underlying
Securities, or any document relating
thereto, or receives any other solicitation
for any action with respect to the
Underlying Securities, the Trustee shall
within two (2) Business Days mail a
notice of such proposed amendment,
modification, waiver or solicitation to the
Swap Counterparty and each
Certificateholder of record as of the date of such
request. The Trustee shall request
instructions from the Certificateholders as
to what action to take in response to such
request and shall be protected in
taking no action if no direction is
received. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Trustee shall consent or vote,
or refrain from consenting or
voting, in the same proportion (based
 
 
 
                                     
10
<PAGE>
 
on the Stated Amounts of the Certificates
of each Class as allocated based on
the respective Voting Rights of each Class)
as the Certificates were actually
voted or not voted by the Holders thereof
as of the date determined by the
Trustee prior to the date such vote or
consent is required; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Base Trust Agreement or
this Series Supplement, the Trustee shall
at no time vote in favor of or
consent to any matter (i) which would alter
the timing or amount of any
payment on the Underlying Securities
(including, without limitation, any
demand to accelerate the Underlying
Securities) or (ii) which would result in
the exchange or substitution of any
Underlying Security whether or not
pursuant to a plan for the refunding or
refinancing of such Underlying
Security, except in each case with the
unanimous consent of the
Certificateholders; provided, further, that
the Trustee shall not take any
such action if it would affect the method,
amount or timing of payments due to
the Swap Counterparty or otherwise
materially adversely affect the interests
of the Swap Counterparty under the Swap
Agreement and result in a Swap
Agreement Termination Event, in each case
without the prior written consent of
the Swap Counterparty. The Trustee shall
have no liability for any failure to
act or to refrain from acting resulting
from the Certificateholders' late
return of, or failure to return, directions
requested by the Trustee from the
Certificateholders.
 
           
(d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the
contrary, the Trustee may require from the
Certificateholders prior to taking
any action at the direction of the
Certificateholders, an indemnity agreement
of a Certificateholder or any of its
Affiliates to provide for security or
indemnity against the costs, expenses and
liabilities the Trustee may incur by
reason of any such action. An unsecured
indemnity agreement, if acceptable to
the Trustee, shall be deemed to be
sufficient to satisfy such security or
indemnity requirement.
 
           
(e) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the
contrary, the Trustee shall act as the sole
Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent
and Registrar.
 
           
Section 13. Compensation of Trustee. The Trustee shall be
entitled
to receive from the Trustor as compensation
for its services hereunder,
trustee's fees pursuant to a separate
agreement between the Trustee and the
Trustor, and shall be reimbursed for all
reasonable expenses, disbursements
and advances incurred or made by it
(including the reasonable compensation,
disbursements and expenses of its counsel
and other persons not regularly in
its employ). The Trustor shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Trustee and its
successors, assigns, agents and servants
against any and all loss, liability
or reasonable expense (including attorney's
fees) incurred by it in connection
with the administration of this trust and
the performance of its duties
thereunder. The Trustee shall notify the
Trustor promptly of any claim for
which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the
Trustee to so notify the Trustor
shall not relieve the Trustor of its
obligations hereunder. The Trustor need
not reimburse any expense or indemnify
against any loss, liability or expense
incurred by the Trustee through the
Trustee's own willful misconduct,
negligence or bad faith. The indemnities
contained in this Section 13 shall
survive the resignation or termination of
the Trustee or the termination of
this Agreement.
 
           
Failure by the Trustor to pay, reimburse or indemnify the
Trustee
shall not entitle the Trustee to any
payment, reimbursement or indemnification
from the Trust, nor shall such failure
release the Trustee from the duties it
is required to perform under this Series
Supplement. Any unpaid, unreimbursed
or unindemnified amounts shall not be borne
by the Trust and shall
 
 
 
                                     
11
<PAGE>
 
not constitute a claim against the Trust,
but shall be borne by the Trustee in
its individual capacity, and the Trustee
shall have no recourse against the
Trust with respect thereto.
 
           
Section 14. Modification or Amendment of the Base Trust
Agreement,
the Series Supplement or the Swap
Agreement. (a) The Trustee shall not enter
into any modification or amendment of the
Base Trust Agreement or this Series
Supplement unless such modification or
amendment is in accordance with Section
10.1 of the Base Trust Agreement. If the
Rating Agency Condition is not
satisfied with respect to any proposed
modification or amendment of the Base
Trust Agreement or this Series Supplement,
then any such modification or
amendment must be approved by 100% of the
Certificateholders. The Trustee
shall not enter into any amendment or
modification of this Agreement that
would affect the method, amount or timing
of payment due to the Swap
Counterparty or the consent rights of the
Swap Counterparty hereunder or
otherwise materially adversely affect the
interests of the Swap Counterparty
under the Swap Agreement and result in a
Swap Agreement Termination Event, in
each case without the prior written consent
of the Swap Counterparty. The
Trustee shall provide fifteen Business Days
written notice to the Swap
Counterparty before entering into any
amendment or modification of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.
 
           
(b) The Trustee shall not enter into any modification or
amendment
of the Swap Agreement without the prior
written consent of holders of
Certificates representing 66 ?% of the
Voting Rights and without prior written
confirmation from the Rating Agency that
such amendment will not result in a
reduction or withdrawal of the then current
rating of the Certificates;
provided, however, that each of the Swap
Counterparty and the Trustee may
amend the Swap Agreement without the prior
written consent of
Certificateholders to cure any ambiguity
in, or to correct or supplement any
provision of the Swap Agreement which may
be inconsistent with any other
provision of the Swap Agreement, or to
otherwise cure any defect in the Swap
Agreement, provided that any such amendment
does not materially adversely
affect the interest of the
Certificateholders and that the Rating Agency will
have given its prior written confirmation
that such amendment will not result
in a reduction or withdrawal of the then
current rating of the Certificates;
provided further, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no
amendment may alter the timing or amount of
any payment on the Swap Agreement
without the prior consent of 100% of the
Certificateholders and without giving
the Rating Agency prior written notice of
any such amendment.
 
           
(c) Until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual
knowledge of the occurrence of an event
that would constitute a Swap Agreement
Termination Event, the Trustee shall be
entitled to assume (and shall be fully
protected, indemnified and held harmless in
doing so) that no Swap Agreement
Termination Event has occurred and may
accordingly seek instructions under
Section 12 and this Section 14 exclusively
from the Swap Counterparty.
 
           
Section 15. Assignment of Rights under the Swap Agreement. The
Trustee may consent to any transfer or
assignment by the Swap Counterparty of
its rights under the Swap Agreement, so
long as the Rating Agency shall have
given its prior written confirmation that
such transfer or assignment will not
result in a reduction or withdrawal of the
then current rating of the
Certificates.

Base
Trust Agreement, "Independent Public
Accountants' Administration Report," no
such accounting reports shall be required.
Pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Base
Trust Agreement, "Reports to
Certificateholders," the Trustee shall cause the
statement described in Section 4.2 to be
prepared and forwarded as provided
therein.
 
           
Section 17. No Investment of Amounts Received on Underlying
Securities. All amounts received on or with
respect to the Underlying

(c) In the event a Payment Default or an Acceleration occurs,
the
Trustee shall promptly give notice to the
Swap Counterparty and to the
Depositary or, for any Certificates which
are not then held by the Depositary
or any other depository, directly to the
registered holders of the
Certificates thereof. Such notice shall set
forth (i) the identity of the
issue of Underlying Securities, (ii) the
date and nature of such Payment
Default or Acceleration, (iii) the
principal amount of the interest or
principal in default, (iv) the Certificates
affected by the Payment Default or
Acceleration, and (v) any other information
which the Trustee may deem
appropriate.
 
           
(d) Notwithstanding any provisions of the Agreement to the
contrary, the Trustee shall deliver all
notices or reports required to be
delivered to or by the Trustee or the
Trustor to the Certificateholders or the
Swap Counterparty without charge to such
Certificateholders or the Swap
Counterparty.

required pursuant to the
 
 
 
                                     
13
<PAGE>
 
Agreement), provide such notice or
documents to the Swap Counterparty
concurrently with the delivery thereof to

Certificate Register for purposes of
contacting the other Certificateholders
with respect to their rights hereunder
or for the purposes of effecting purchases
or sales of the Certificates,
subject to the transfer restrictions set
forth herein.
 
           
Section 21. Advances. There is no Administrative Agent
specified

Trustee) shall be permitted or
obligated to make Advances as described in
Section 4.3 of the Base Trust
Agreement, "Advances."
 
           
Section 22. Ratification of Agreement. With respect to the
Series
issued hereby, the Base Trust Agreement
(including the grant of a security
interest in Section 10.8 of the Base Trust
Agreement with respect to the
Underlying Securities conveyed hereunder),
as supplemented by this Series
Supplement, is in all respects ratified and
confirmed, and the Base Trust
Agreement as so supplemented by this Series
Supplement shall be read, taken
and construed as one and the same
instrument. To the extent there is any
inconsistency between the terms of the Base
Trust Agreement and this Series
Supplement, the terms of this Series
Supplement shall govern.
 
           
Section 23. Counterparts. This Series Supplement may be
executed
in any number of counterparts, each of
which so executed shall be deemed to be
an original, but all of such counterparts
shall together constitute but one

Section 24. Governing Law. This Series Supplement and each
Certificate issued hereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York
applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely therein without
reference to such State's principles of
conflicts of law to the extent that the
application of the laws of another
jurisdiction would be required thereby, and
the obligations, rights and
remedies of the parties hereunder shall be

event
that an event requiring the sale of the
Underlying Securities under this
Agreement occurs and the Underlying
Securities are liquidated at a loss, the
Trustee will disclose pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4 the
loss in accordance with the procedures of
such regulation, unless the Trustee
obtains advice from counsel that such
disclosure is not necessary. In general,
the Trustee

<PAGE>
 
will (x) attach a completed Form 8886 to
its tax return in the year the
requisite loss occurs and (y) file a
completed form with the Office of Tax
Shelter Analysis (OTSA) at: Internal
Revenue Service LM:PFTG:OTSA, Large and
Midsize Business Division, 1111
Constitution Avenue., NW., Washington DC 20224
(or such other address subsequently
required).
 
           
Section 27. Establishment of Accounts. The Securities
Intermediary
and the Trustee hereby represent and
warrant that:
 
           
(a) Each Account for the Trust is a "securities account" within
the meaning of Section 8-501 of the UCC and
is held only in the name of the
Trustee on behalf of the Trust. The
Securities Intermediary is acting in the
capacity of a "securities intermediary"
within the meaning of Section
8-102(a)(14) of the UCC;
 
           
(b) All Underlying Securities have been (i) delivered to the
Securities Intermediary pursuant to the
Agreement and (ii) credited to the
Certificate Account; and
 
           
(c) Each Account is an account to which financial assets are or
may be credited, and the Securities
Intermediary shall treat the Trustee as
entitled to exercise the rights that
comprise any financial asset credited to
the Accounts.
 
           
Section 28. Statement of Intent. It is the intention of the
parties hereto that, for purposes of
federal income taxes, state and local
income and franchise taxes and any other
taxes imposed upon, measured by or
based upon gross or net income, the Trust
shall be treated as a grantor trust,
but failing that, as a partnership (other
than a publicly traded partnership
taxable as a corporation) and, in any
event, shall not be classified as a
corporation. The parties hereto agree that,
unless otherwise required by
appropriate tax authorities, the Trustee
shall file or cause to be filed
annual or other necessary returns, reports
and other forms consistent with
such intended characterization. In the
event that the Trust is characterized
by appropriate tax authorities as a
partnership for federal income tax
purposes, each Certificateholder, by its
acceptance of its Certificate, agrees
to report its respective share of the items
of income, deductions, and credits
of the Trust on its respective returns
(making such elections as to individual
items as may be appropriate) in accordance
with Treasury Regulations Section
1.761-2(b) (the "761 Election") and in a
manner consistent with the complete
exclusion of the Trust from subchapter K of
the Code. The terms of the
Agreement shall be interpreted to further
these intentions of the parties. As
further consideration for each
Certificateholder's purchase of a Certificate,
each such Certificateholder is deemed to
agree not to irrevocably delegate to
any person (for a period of more than one
year) authority to purchase, sell or
exchange its Certificates.
 
           
Each Certificateholder (and each beneficial owner of a
Certificate) by acceptance of its
Certificate (or its beneficial interest
therein) agrees, unless otherwise required
by appropriate tax authorities, to
file its own tax returns and reports in a
manner consistent with the
characterization indicated above.
 
           
Section 29. Filing of Partnership Returns. In the event that
the
Trust is characterized (by appropriate tax
authorities) as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes,
and the 761 Election is
ineffective, the Trustor agrees to
reimburse the Trust for any expenses
associated with the filing of partnership
returns (or returns related
thereto).

Section 30. "Financial Assets" Election. The Securities
Intermediary hereby agrees that the
Underlying Securities credited to the
Certificate Account and any Posted
Collateral credited to the Collateral
Account shall be treated as a "financial
asset" within the meaning of Section
8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.
 
           
Section 31. Trustee's Entitlement Orders. If at any time the
Securities Intermediary shall receive any
order from the Trustee directing the
transfer or redemption of any Underlying
Securities credited to the Accounts,
the Securities Intermediary shall comply
with such entitlement order without
further consent by the Trustor or any other
Person. The Securities
Intermediary shall take all instructions
(including without limitation all
notifications and entitlement orders) with
respect to the Accounts solely from
the Trustee.
 
           
Section 32. Conflict with Other Agreements. The Securities
Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees
that:
 
           
(a) There are no other agreements entered into between the
Securities Intermediary and the Trustor
with respect to the Accounts. Each
Account and all property credited to the
Account is not subject to, and the
Securities Intermediary hereby waives, any
lien, security interest, right of
set off, or encumbrance in favor of the
Securities Intermediary or any Person
claiming through the Securities
Intermediary (other than the Trustee);
 
           
(b) It has not entered into, and until the termination of the
Agreement will not enter into, any
agreement with any other Person relating to
the Accounts and/or any financial assets
credited thereto pursuant to which it
has agreed to comply with entitlement
orders of any Person other than the
Trustee; and
 
           
(c) It has not entered into, and until the termination of the
Agreement will not enter into, any
agreement with any Person purporting to
limit or condition the obligation of the
Securities Intermediary to comply
with entitlement orders as set forth in
Section 31 hereof.
 
           
Section 33. Additional Trustee and Securities Intermediary
Representations. The Trustee and the
Securities Intermediary each hereby
represents and warrants as follows:
 
           
(a) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each maintains
its
books and records with respect to its
securities accounts in the State of New
York;
 
           
(b) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each has not
granted any lien on the Underlying
Securities nor are the Underlying
Securities subject to any lien on
properties of the Trustee or the Securities
Intermediary in its individual capacity;
the Trustee and the Securities
Intermediary each has no actual knowledge
and has not received actual notice
of any lien on the Underlying Securities
(other than any liens of the Trustee
in favor of the beneficiaries of the Trust
Agreement); other than the
interests of the Trustee, the
Certificateholders and the Swap Counterparty,
the books and records of the Trustee and
the Securities Intermediary each do
not identify any Person as having an
interest in the Underlying Securities;
and
 
           
(c) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each makes no
representation as to (i) the validity,
legality, sufficiency or enforceability
of any of the Underlying Securities or (ii)
the collectability, insurability,
effectiveness or suitability of any of the
Underlying Securities.

Section 34. Additional Trustor Representations. The Trustor
hereby
represents and warrants to the Trustee as
follows:
 
           
(a) Immediately prior to the sale of the Underlying Securities
to
the Trustee, the Trustor, as Depositor,
owned and had good and marketable
title to the Underlying Securities free and
clear of any lien, claim or
encumbrance of any Person;
 
           
(b) The Trustor, as Depositor, has received all consents and
approvals required by the terms of the
Underlying Securities to the sale to
the Trustee of its interest and rights in
the Underlying Securities as
contemplated by the Agreement; and
 
           
(c) The Trustor has not assigned, pledged, sold, granted a
security interest in or otherwise conveyed
any interest in the Underlying
Securities (or, if any such interest has
been assigned, pledged or otherwise
encumbered, it has been released), except
such interests sold pursuant to the
Agreement. The Trustor has not authorized
the filing of and is not aware of
any financing statements against the
Trustor that includes a description of
the Underlying Securities, other than any
such filings pursuant to the
Agreement. The Trustor is not aware of any
judgment or tax lien filings
against Trustor.
 
           
Section 35. Certification Requirements. The Trustee agrees to
obtain, at the Trustor's direction and
expense, a report of an independent
public accountant sufficient for the
Trustor on behalf of the Trust to satisfy
its obligations with respect to
certification requirements under Rules 13a-14
and 15d-14 of the Exchange Act.
 
           
Section 36. Additional Rights of the Swap Counterparty. Section
10.8 of the Base Trust Agreement is hereby
modified for purposes of this
Series Supplement to provide that the
security interest referred to and
created pursuant thereto in the Trust
assets shall, in addition to the
obligations provided for under Section
10.8(b)(3), secure all of the
obligations of the Trustor and the Trust to
the Swap Counterparty under the
Swap Agreement and this Agreement. The Swap
Counterparty shall have the rights
of a third party beneficiary with respect
to this Agreement.
 
           
Section 37. Modification of Certain Provisions of Base Trust
Agreement. The provisions of the Base Trust
Agreement shall be modified as
they are applied with respect to this
Series of Certificates to provide that
(i) notwithstanding Section 3.9 of the Base
Trust Agreement, the Certificate

Certificateholders and the Swap
Counterparty and amounts in the Certificate
Account shall be used to make
distributions to the Swap Counterparty as
and when required under this Series
Supplement, (ii) the appointment of any
successor of the Trustee under Section
8.7 of the Base Trust Agreement shall be

17

with this Agreement and the Swap
Agreement and the disposition of the final
payments received under the Swap
Agreement.
 
           
Section 38. Evidence of Integration for Tax Purposes. The

subject to satisfaction of all of the
conditions set forth in clause (b), the

it for a distribution of
Underlying Securities representing the same

(b) The following conditions shall apply to any Optional
Exchange.
 
           
(A) A notice specifying the number of Certificates being

(B) Certificates shall be surrendered to the trustee no later
than
      10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) on the optional exchange date.
 
           
(C) The Trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel
stating
      that the

association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation
for
      federal
income tax purposes.
 
           
(D) No more than one (1) Optional Exchange shall occur in any
      Collection
Period.
 
           
(E) The Trustee shall not be obligated to determine whether an

      interest
in or a right to specific performance with respect to the
      Underlying
Securities; provided that satisfaction of the conditions set
      forth in
this Section 39 shall entitle the Depositor to a distribution
     
thereof.
 
           
(G) The aggregate principal balance of Certificates exchanged
in
      connection
with any Optional Exchange pursuant to this Section 39 shall
      be in an

      in an even
multiple of the minimum denomination of the Underlying
     
Securities.
 
 
 
                                     
18
<PAGE>
 
           
(H) No Swap Agreement Termination Event shall have occurred as
a
      result of
the Optional Exchange except to the extent of a termination
      resulting
from the reduction in the Hedge Notional Amount (as defined in
      the Swap
Agreement) to an amount equal to the principal amount of the
      Underlying
Securities after giving effect to the Optional Exchange.
 
        
    (I) Any
payments due under the Swap Agreement as a result of the
      reduction
in such Hedge Notional Amount and any such Swap Agreement
     
Termination Event (x) that are due to the Swap Counterparty
(including
      but not
limited to Unpaid Amounts) shall have been paid to the Swap

Swap

This Certificate does not represent an

      THIS
CERTIFIES THAT Cede & Co. is the registered owner of a
nonassessable, fully-paid, fractional
undivided interest in STRATS(SM) Trust For
General Electric Capital Corporation

C-1
<PAGE>
 
Supplement 2004-15, dated as of November
15, 2004 (the "Series Supplement"
and, together with the Agreement, the
"Trust Agreement"), between the Trustor
and the Trustee. This Certificate does not
purport to summarize the Trust
Agreement and reference is hereby made to
the Trust Agreement for information
with respect to the interests, rights,
benefits, obligations, proceeds and
duties evidenced hereby and the rights,
duties and obligations of the Trustee
with respect hereto. A copy of the Trust
Agreement may be obtained from the
Trustee by written request sent to the
Corporate Trust Office. Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein have the
meanings assigned to them in the
Trust Agreement.
 
      This
Certificate is one of the duly authorized Certificates
designated
as "STRATS(SM) Certificates, Series 2004-15
(herein called the "Certificate" or
"Certificates"). This Certificate is issued
under and is subject to the terms,
provisions and conditions of the Trust
Agreement, to which Trust Agreement the
Holder of this Certificate by virtue of the
acceptance hereof assents and by
which such Holder is bound. The assets of
the Trust include the Underlying
Securities, all proceeds of the Underlying
Securities and the Trust's rights
under the Swap Agreement.
 
      Under the
Trust Agreement, there shall be distributed on the dates
specified in the Trust Agreement (a
"Distribution Date"), to the person in
whose name this Certificate is registered
at the close of business on the
related Record Date, such
Certificateholder's fractional undivided interest in
the amount of distributions of the
Underlying Securities to be distributed to
Certificateholders on such Distribution
Date and distributions to the Trust
under the Swap Agreement. The Underlying
Securities will pay interest on March
15 and September 15 of each year. The
principal of the Underlying Securities
is scheduled to be paid on September 15,
2014. The Swap Agreement provides for
payments on the 15th calendar day of each
month, commencing on December 15,
2004.
 
      The
distributions in respect of this Certificate are payable in
such
coin or currency of the United States of
America as at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and
private debts as set forth in the
Series Trust Agreement.
 
      The
Underlying Securities held by the Trust are subject to the rights
of
the Swap Counterparty, as provided for in
the Series Supplement and the Swap
Agreement, and each Certificateholder, by
accepting its Certificate,
acknowledges such rights in accordance with
the terms of the Series Supplement
and the Swap Agreement.
 
      It is the
intent of the Trustor and the Certificateholders that the
Trust will be classified as a grantor trust
under subpart E, Part I of
subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended. Except as
otherwise required by appropriate taxing
authorities, the Trustor and the
Trustee, by executing the Trust Agreement,
and each Certificateholder, by
acceptance of a Certificate, agrees to
treat, and to take no action
inconsistent with the treatment of, the
Certificates for such tax purposes as
interests in a grantor trust and the
provisions of the Trust Agreement shall
be interpreted to further this intention of
the parties.
 
      By
acceptance of a Certificate, each Certificateholder (1) elects
to
integrate the Underlying Securities and the
Swap Agreement for United States
federal income tax purposes, (2) authorizes
and directs the trustee (or the
trustee's agent) to retain, as part of the
Certificateholder's books and
records, information that (a) describes the
Underlying Securities
 
 
 
                                    
C-2
<PAGE>
 
and the Swap Agreement, (b) identifies the
two positions as integrated for
federal income tax purposes and (c)
describes the features of the resulting
"synthetic" debt instrument and (3) agrees
to retain copies of such
information as provided to the
Certificateholder by the Trust.
 
       Each
Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Certificate,
covenants
and agrees that such Certificateholder
shall not, prior to the date which is
one year and one day after the termination
of the Trust Agreement, acquiesce,
petition or otherwise invoke or cause the
Trustor to invoke the process of any
court or governmental authority for the
purpose of commencing or sustaining a
case against the Trustor under any federal
or state bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar law or appointing
a receiver, liquidator, assignee,
trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other
similar official of the Trustor or
any substantial part of its property, or
ordering the winding up or
liquidation of the affairs of the
Trustor.
 
     
Certificates may not be acquired by or for the account of any
employee
benefit plan, trust or account, including
an individual retirement account,
that is subject to the requirements of
Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or
that is described in Section
4975(e)(1) of the Code, or by or for the
account of any entity whose
underlying assets include any assets
subject to these laws by reason of
investment in that entity by such plans,
trusts or accounts. By accepting and
holding this Certificate, the holder of
this Certificate will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that it is
not a plan or entity described
above, and that its acquisition and holding
of this Certificate are in
compliance with the foregoing
restrictions.
 
      The Trust
Agreement permits the amendment thereof, in certain
circumstances, without the consent of the
Holders of any of the Certificates.
 
      Unless the
certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed
by an authorized officer of the Trustee by
manual signature, this Certificate
shall not entitle the Holder hereof to any
benefit under the Trust Agreement
or be valid for any purpose.
 
      A copy of
the Trust Agreement is available upon request and all of its
terms and conditions are hereby
incorporated by reference and made a part
hereof.
 
      THIS
CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE
STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS
CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND

MASTER AGREEMENT
 
                        
dated as of November 15, 2004
 
WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL        and
  STRATS(SM) TRUST FOR
GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL
ASSOCIATION                        
CORPORATION SECURITIES, SERIES 2004-15
 
have entered and/or anticipate entering
into one of more transactions (each a
"Transaction") that are or will be governed
by this Master Agreement, which
includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and
the documents and other confirming
evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged
between the parties confirming
those Transactions.
 
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:
--
 
1.     Interpretation
 
(a)    Definitions. The terms
defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will
have the meanings therein specified for the
purpose of this Master Agreement.
 
(b)    Inconsistency. In the event
of any inconsistency between the provisions
of the Schedule and the other provisions of
this Master Agreement, the
Schedule will prevail. In the event of any
inconsistency between the
provisions of any Confirmation and this
Master Agreement (including the
Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail
for the purpose of the relevant
Transaction.
 
(c)    Single Agreement. All
Transactions are entered into in reliance on the
fact that this Master Agreement and all
Confirmations form a single agreement
between the parties (collectively referred
to as this "Agreement"), and the
parties would not otherwise enter into any
Transactions.
 
2.     Obligations
 
(a)    General Conditions.
 
      (i) Each
party will make each payment or delivery specified in each
     
Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of
this
     
Agreement.
 
      (ii)
Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for
       value on that
date in the place of the account specified in the relevant
     
Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely
     
transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in
the
      required
currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than
      by
payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date
in
      the manner
customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise
      specified
in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
 
      (iii) Each
obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to
      (1) the
condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event
      of Default
with respect to the other party has occurred and is
 
 
 
 
             
                      
D-1-1
<PAGE>
 
     
continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination
Date
      in respect
of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively
      designated
and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified
      in this
Agreement.
 
(b)    Change of Account. Either
party may change its account for receiving a
payment or delivery by giving notice to the
other party at least five Local
Business Days prior to the scheduled date
for the payment or delivery to which
such change applies unless such other party
gives timely notice of a
reasonable objection to such change.
 
(c)    Netting. If on any date
amounts would otherwise be payable: --
 
      (i) in the
same currency; and
 
      (ii) in
respect of the same Transaction,
 
by each party to the other. then, on such
date, each party's obligation to
make payment of any such amount will be
automatically satisfied and discharged
and, if the aggregate amount that would
otherwise have been payable by one
party exceeds the aggregate amount that
would otherwise have been payable by
the other party, replaced by an obligation
upon the party by whom the larger
aggregate amount would have been payable to
pay to the other party the excess
of the larger aggregate amount over the
smaller aggregate amount.
 
The parties may elect in respect of two or
more Transactions that a net amount
will be determined in respect of all
amounts payable on the same date in the
same currency in respect of such
Transactions, regardless of whether such
amounts are payable in respect of the same
Transaction. The election may be
made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by
specifying that subparagraph (ii)
above will not apply to the Transactions
identified as being subject to the
election, together with the starting date
(in which case subparagraph (ii)
above will not, or will cease to, apply to
such Transactions from such date).
This election may be made separately for
different groups of Transactions and
will apply separately to each pairing of
Offices through which the parties
make and receive payments or
deliveries.
 
(d)    Deduction or Withholding for
Tax.
 
      (i)
Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without
any
      deduction
or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such
      deduction
or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified
      by the
practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then
in
      effect. If
a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party
      ("X")
will: --
 
           
(1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;
 
           
(2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to
be
           
deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be
           
deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y
           
under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of
determining
           
that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving
notice
           
that such amount has been assessed against Y;
 
           
(3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified
           
copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y,
           
evidencing such payment to such authorities; and
 
           
(4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition
to
           
the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this
Agreement,
           
such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net
           
amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable
           
Taxes. whether assessed against X or Y) will equal ft full
amount
           
Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
           
required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional
     
      
amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be
paid
           
but for: --
 
                
(A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement
                
contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or
 
         
       
(B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to
                
Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure
                
would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a
                
taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent
                
jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a
 
 
 
                                   
D-1-2
<PAGE>
 
                 
Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such
                 
action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this
                 
Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.
 
      (ii)
  Liability. If: --
 
           
(1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
           
practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to
make
           
any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be
           
required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section
           
2(d)(i)(4);
 
           
(2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and
 
         
   (3) a liability
resulting from such Tax is assessed directly
           
against X,
 
      then,
except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the
      liability
resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount
      of such
liability (including any related liability for interest, but
      including
any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to
      comply
with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i),
      4(a)(iii)
or 4(d)).
 
(e)    Default Interest; Other
Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in
respect of the relevant
Transaction, a party that defaults in the
performance of any payment
obligation will, to the extent permitted by
law and subject to Section 6(c),
be required to pay interest (before as well
as after judgment) on the overdue
amount to the other party on demand in the
same currency as such overdue
amount, for the period from (and including)
the original due date for payment
to (but excluding) the date of actual
payment, at the Default Rate. Such
interest will be calculated on the basis of
daily compounding and the actual
number of days elapsed. If, prior to the
occurrence or effective designation
of an Early Termination Date in respect of
the relevant Transaction, a party
defaults in the performance of any
obligation required to be settled by
delivery, it will compensate the other
party on demand if and to the extent
provided for in the relevant Confirmation
or elsewhere in this Agreement.
 
3.      Representations
 
Each party represents to the other party
(which representations will be deemed
to be repeated by each party on each date
on which a Transaction is entered
into and, in the case of the
representations in Section 3(f), at all times
until the termination of this Agreement)
