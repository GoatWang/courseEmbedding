(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See "Forward-Looking Statements."  Overview  Yangtze River Development Limited is a Nevada corporation that operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary Energetic Mind Limited, a British Virgin Islands company, which holds 100% capital stock of Ricofeliz Capital (HK) Ltd., a Hong Kong company that holds 100% capital stock of Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise formed under the laws of the People's Republic of China that primarily engages in the business of real estate and infrastructural development with a port logistics center located in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. Situated in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan Newport is a large infrastructure development project implemented under China's latest "One Belt One Road" initiative and is believed to be strategically positioned in the "Pilot Free Trade Zone" of the Wuhan Port, a crucial trading window among China, the Middle East and Europe. To be fully developed upon completion, within the Logistics Center, there will be six operating zones: including port operation area, warehouse and distribution area, cold chain logistics area, rail cargo loading area, exhibition area and business related area. The logistics center is also expected to provide a number of shipping berths for cargo ships of various sizes. Wuhan Newport is expected to provide domestic and foreign businesses a direct access to the Free Trade Zone in Wuhan. The project will include commercial buildings, professional logistic supply chain centers, direct access to the Yangtze River, Wuhan-Xinjiang-Europe Railway and ground transportation, storage and processing centers, IT supporting services, among others.  Our Logistics Center is an extensive complex located in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province of China, a major transportation hub city with access to numerous railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to major cities in China, as well as other international centers of commerce and business.  The Logistics Center is expected to occupy approximately 1,918,000 square meters, for which the construction and development are expected to be completed in five years while the total anticipated investment have been divided into three phases - 40% of the total in the first year and 30% respectively in the second and third year. The following table illustrates the timeframe of our investment and construction progress.   Percentage of Total Phase of Anticipated Time Investment/Construction Investment/Construction (1) Production Capacity (2) 1st Year (2017) 1st Phase 40% 30% 2nd Year (2018) 2nd Phase 70% 40% 3rd Year (2019) 3rd Phase 100% 60% 4th Year (2020) Completed 100% 75% 5th Year (2021) Completed 100% 100%  (1) The percentage of construction in a certain phase reflects the anticipated contribution of the investment in such particular phase. For example, contribution of 40% of the total investment in Phase 1 will lead to construction of 40% of total value of the Logistics Center.  The Logistics Center is located within the Wuhan Newport Yangluo Port, on the upper stream of the Yangtze River, and close to the northern base of Wu Iron and Steel, China's first mega-sized iron and steel production complex. The Logistics Center is expected to include a port terminal that will be located approximately 26.5km from the Wuhan Guan and 5.5km from the Yangluo Yangtze River Bridge. The operation area of the port is expected to consist of a riverbank of 1,039 meters with eight 5,000-to-10,000-ton berths, two of which are multi-purpose berths and the other six are general cargo berths. It is designed to be able to handle up to 5,000,000 tons of cargo annually, including up to 100,000 TEU for annual container throughput (including 20,000 TEU in freezers areas), 1,000,000 tons of iron and steel and 3,000,000 tons of general cargo.  Within the Logistics Center, functional areas will be divided into six operating zones: a port operation area, a warehouse and distribution area, a cold chain supply logistics area, a rail cargo loading area, an exhibition area and a business related area. The Logistics Center will also be complemented with container storage areas, multi-functional areas, general storage areas, multi-functional warehouse and infrastructural development, including new roads, gas stations, parking areas, gas and water pipes, electricity lines and all other facilities and equipment to operate the Logistics Center.  Wuhan Newport has signed a twenty-year lease agreement, maximum number of years permitted by the applicable PRC laws, and with rights to renew at its sole discretion effective April 27, 2015 to lease approximately 1,200,000 square meters of land for building logistics warehouses in support of the Logistics Center. The warehouses are expected to comprise of port terminal zones, warehouse logistics zones, cold chain supply zones and railroad loading and unloading zones. The warehouses will connect the port terminal along the Yangtze River and the railway leading to Europe, satisfying the requirement of China's latest "One Belt, One Road" initiative. It will also be able to support large logistics companies in Wuhan and other nearby provinces which will rent the warehouses, terminals and offices within the Logistics Center.  Pilot Free Trade Zone  Aside from being situated in the Wuhan Yangluo Comprehensive Bonded Zone, Yangluo development area is strategically situated at one of China's Pilot Free Trade Zone (FTZ). On March 31, 2017, the PRC State Council has approved the establishment of seven pilot free trade zones in Liaoning, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi as well as Chongqing municipality. On April 1, 2017, the seven zones were officially open. Hubei FTZ will be built on an area of 119.96 square kilometers including up to 70 square kilometers in Wuhan, and focus on the emerging industries like intelligent manufacturing, as well as the modern service industries relating to international trade, financial services, modern logistics, inspection & testing, R&D, information services, professional services, etc. (Source:  Factors Affecting our Operating Results  Growth of China's Economy. We operate and derive all of our revenue from operations in China. Economic conditions in China, therefore, affect our operations, including the demand for our properties and services and the availability and prices of land maintenance among other expenses. China has experienced significant economic growth with recorded Gross Domestic Product growth rates at 7.4% in 2014, 6.9% in 2015 and 6.7% in 2016. China is expected to experience continued growth in all areas of investment and consumption. However, if the Chinese economy were to become significantly affected by a negative stimulus, China's growth rate would likely to fall and our revenue could correspondingly decline.  Government Regulations. Our business and results of operations are subject to PRC government policies and regulations regarding the following:  ? Land Use Right - According to the Land Administration Law of the PRC and Interim Regulations of the People's Republic of China Concerning the Assignment and Transfer of the Right to the Use of the State-owned Land in the Urban Areas, individuals and companies are permitted to acquire rights to use urban land or land use rights for specific purposes, including residential, industrial and commercial purposes. We acquire land use rights from local governments and/or other entities for development of residential and commercial real estate projects. We do not have ownership over these lands.  ? Land Development - According to the Urban Real Estate Development and Operation Administration Regulation, the Urban Real Estate Development and Operation Administration Rules of Hebei Province promulgated by the government of the Hebei Province, and the Real Estate Development Enterprise Qualification Administration Regulation, a real estate development enterprise shall obtain a Real Estate Development Enterprise Qualification Certificate. We obtained the related certificates and seek to ensure that each phase of our projects complies with our certificates.  ? Project Financing - According to the Land Administration Law and the Property Law of the PRC, the land use rights, residential housing and other buildings still in process of construction may be pledged and mortgaged. From time to time, we pledge and mortgage our land use rights and real properties to lenders in order to obtain project financing.  Interest Rate and Inflation Challenges. We are subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates and refinancing of mid-term debt. Higher interest rates may also affect our revenues, gross profits and our ability to raise and service debt and to finance our developments. Inflation could result in increases in the price of raw materials and labor costs. We do not believe that inflation or deflation has affected our business materially.  Acquisitions of Land Use Rights and Associated Costs. We acquire land use rights for development through the governmental auction process and by obtaining land use rights permits from third parties through negotiation, acquisition of entities, co-development or other joint venture arrangements. Our ability to secure sufficient financing for land use rights acquisitions and property development depends on internal cash flows in addition to lenders' perceptions of our credit reliability, market conditions in the capital markets, investors' perception of our securities, the PRC economy and the PRC government regulations that affect the availability and cost of financing real estate companies or property purchasers.  Critical Accounting Estimates  As discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we consider our estimates on revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, and real estate property refunds and compensation payables to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes to these estimates in the period ended March 31, 2017.  Results of Operations Comparison of Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated in U.S. dollars For the three months ended March 31 2017 2016 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Revenue $ - $ - Costs of revenue - - Gross profit - - Operating expenses General and administrative expenses 747,206 1,955,484 Total operating expenses 747,206 1,955,484 Loss from operations (747,206 ) (1,955,484 ) Other income (expenses) Other expenses (21 ) (28 ) Interest income 38 76 Interest expenses (2,127,056 ) (2,158,685 ) Total other expenses (2,127,039 ) (2,158,637 ) Loss before income taxes (2,874,245 ) (4,114,121 ) Income taxes benefits 284,503 306,927 Net loss $ (2,589,742 ) $ (3,807,194 ) Other comprehensive loss Foreign currency translation adjustments 2,230,642 1,939,918 Comprehensive loss $ (359,100 ) $ (1,867,276 ) Loss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.01 ) $ (0.02 ) Weighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 238,936,113 172,265,325  Revenue.  We did not generate any revenue from the sales of real estate property for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. In addition, since our Logistics Center is still in its development stage and therefore is not yet in operation, we have not started providing any logistics service within our port terminal and have not generated any sales from providing such services.  Cost of Revenue.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, our cost of goods sold were $0.  Gross Profit.  Our gross margin were $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  General and administrative expenses.  Our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, office expenses, utilities, business travel, legal expenses, accounting expenses, other professional service expenses and stock compensation. General and administrative expenses were $747,206 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $1,955,484 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $1,208,278. The significant decrease is mainly because of the decrease of expenses related to share based compensation expense.  Loss from operations.  As a result of the factors described above, operating loss was $747,206 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to operating loss of $1,955,484 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of operating loss of $1,208,278. The general and administrative expenses constitute all of our loss from operations.  Other expenses.  We had other expenses totaling $2,127,039 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to other expense totaling $2,158,637 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our interest income and interest expenses were $38 and $2,127,056, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to interest income and interest expenses of $76 and $2,158,685, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our other expenses were $21 and $28, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Income tax.  We received an income tax benefit of $284,503 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $306,927 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The slight decrease is mainly due to the decrease of net loss incurred from Wuhan Newport.  Net loss.  As a result of the factors described above, our net loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $2,589,742, compared to net loss of $3,807,194 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease in loss of $1,217,452. This decrease in loss is mainly attributable to the decrease of cost of share based compensation.  Foreign currency translation.  Our condensed consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars but the functional currency of our operating subsidiary is RMB. Results of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period and equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the financial statements denominated in RMB into U.S. dollars are included in determining comprehensive income. Our foreign currency translation gain for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $2,230,642, compared to a foreign currency translation gain of $1,939,918 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $290,724. The increase of foreign currency translation is mainly attributable to the appreciation of RMB against U.S. dollars.  Net loss available to common stockholders.  Net loss available to our common stockholders was $0.01 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to net loss of $0.02 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 indicated: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities $ (446,817 ) $ (533,737 ) Net Cash Used in Investing Activities $ - $ (1,851 ) Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities $ 448,431 $ 231,990  We had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of $64,894 as of March 31, 2017. We have historically funded our working capital needs through advance payments from customers, bank borrowings, and capital from stockholders. Our working capital requirements are influenced by the state and level of our operations, and the timing of capital needed for projects.  Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $446,817 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $533,737 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $86,920. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily contributed by the following factors:  ? Share-based compensation expense contributed $0 cash inflow for the three months ended March 31, 2017, while in the same period of 2016, share-based compensation expense contributed $1,044,082 cash inflow, which led to an increase of $1,044,082 in net cash outflow.  ? Changes in real estate properties and land lots under development provided $89,637 cash outflow for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to changes in real estate properties and land lots under development provided $57,155 cash outflow in the same period of 2016, which led to an increase of $32,482 in net cash outflow.  ? Changes in accounts payable provided $10 cash inflow for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $47,131 cash inflow for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which lead to an increase of $47,121 in net cash outflow from operating activities.  ? Changes in other payables and accrued liabilities provided $2,173,382 cash inflow for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared other payables and accrued liabilities contributed $2,163,882 cash inflow for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which led to a decrease of $9,500 in net cash outflow.  ? We have net loss of $2,589,742 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to net loss of $3,807,194 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which led to a decrease of $1,217,452 in net cash outflow.  Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $1,851 net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016, representing a decrease of $1,851 in cash outflow.  Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $448,431 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to net cash provided by financing activity of $231,990 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, representing an increase of $216,441 in cash inflow. The increase was primarily attributed to advances of $466,577 from related parties in the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $231,990 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  As shown in our financial statements, we have negative cash flows from operations, sustained recurring losses for a number of years and currently we are not generating revenues. Over the past years, the Company has been funded through a combination of bank loans and advances from shareholders. On January 29, 2016, we received an undertaking commitment letter provided by our majority shareholder who is willing to provide sufficient funding on an as-needed basis. In addition, the Company plans to dispose of the existing developed real estate properties with market value of approximately $42 million when the Company needs cash flows. Based upon the above, the Company believes that it currently has sufficient cash and financing commitments to meet its funding requirements for the next twelve months.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  On January 29, 2016, we received an undertaking commitment letter provided by our majority shareholder who is willing to provide sufficient funding on an as-needed basis.  Critical Accounting Policies  For a detailed discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies, please see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Yangtze River Development Ltd. Announces New Name and Symbol Change


NEW YORK, NY and WUHAN, CHINA / ACCESSWIRE / January 25, 2016 / Yangtze River Development Ltd., (OCT: YERR), formerly known as Kirin International Holdings Inc., (the "Company") changed its name on January 14, 2016 and has received a new trading symbol "YERR" effective January 22, 2016. The Company now operates under the name of "Yangtze River Development Limited" and has been engaging its business through its wholly-owned subsidiary Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co. Limited ("Wuhan Newport"), a company formed under the laws of the People's Republic of China.
Yangtze River Development Limited primarily engages in the business of real estate development with a port logistic project located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Wuhan Newport is a large infrastructure development project implemented under China's latest "One Belt One Road" initiative and is believed to be strategically positioned in the anticipated "Free Trade Zone" of the Wuhan Port, a crucial trading window between China, the Middle East and Europe. To be fully developed upon completion of three phases, within the logistics center, there will be six operating zones, including port operation area, warehouse and distribution area, cold chain logistics area, rail cargo loading area, exhibition area and residential community. The logistics center is also expected to provide a number of shipping berths for cargo ships of various sizes. Wuhan Newport is expected to provide domestic and foreign businesses a direct access to the anticipated Free Trade Zone in Wuhan. The project will include commercial buildings, professional logistic supply chain centers, direct access to the Yangtze River, Wuhan-Xinjiang-Europe Railway and ground transportation, storage and processing centers, IT supporting services, among others.
Yangtze River Development Ltd. will trade on the OTC Markets under the new symbol "YERR" effective January 22, 2016. In addition, the Company opened an office in New York City, 183 Broadway, 5th Floor, NY, NY, to help implement the Company's capital markets strategies.
The Company is led by Xiangyao Liu, who serves as President, CEO, Secretary and Chairman of the Board. Since 2012, Mr. Liu, (44) served as the Deputy General Manager of the Wuhan Huazhou Steel Trading Center Co., Ltd., which later became the Wuhan Yangtze Newport Logistics Co. Ltd. He supervised the transition of the steel trading renter to a residential and commercial complex which supports the warehouses and docks, led projects to bring the Steel Trading Center into the Yangluo Comprehensive Bonded Zone and Free Trade Area in Wuhan, supervised the feasibility study of the Wuhan Yangtze Newport Logistics Center and collaborated with the local government to develop the Yangluo Newport Project Plan, handling corporate structuring, strategic planning and operation management of the company. In 2010, Mr. Liu participated in the investment of Wuhan Renhe Group Limited, which held the Wuhan Huazhou Steel Trading Center Co., Ltd. at that time, supervising logistic and trade of steel. He also started to engage in financial and security investments in Hong Kong. From 1996 to 2003, he invested and established the Pacific Trade and Logistics in China, served as the General Manager and engaged in the trading and logistics of steel, agricultural products and other commodities Mr. Liu received his bachelor degree in Business Management from the Hebei Institute of Finance in 1994.
Xiangyao Liu, Chief Executive Officer, Director and President of Yangtze River Development Ltd., stated, "We are very pleased to have rebranded our Company to reflect our business activities at Wuhan Newport. The tremendous opportunity this facility presents allows us to focus our finances and human capital on a massive logistic facility that has the potential to be one of the most active and, extensive facilities in Asia."

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-0.06      Market Cap $2.08 B     Shares Outstanding 172.27 M     Public Float 12.58 M     Yield YERR has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.54      Net Money Flow ($)  -22,738    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
