Know Your Credit Score | Johnson Bank


















































Your Credit Score
Factors that Affect Your Credit Score
Many different mathematical formulas are used to calculate credit scores and most are based on the following factors, although each scoring model may weight these factors differently:
Payment History
This, along with public records, generally accounts for approximately 35% of your score. A record of late payments on your current and past credit accounts will typically lower your score. Being consistent about paying on time can, over time, have a positive impact on your score.
Public Records
Matters of public record such as bankruptcies, judgments, and collection items may lower your score. Be aware of these, even if you can't always avoid them.
Length of Credit History
In general, a longer credit history is better and can sometimes have a positive impact on your score. Credit history typically accounts for around 15% of your score.
New Credit Accounts
Opening multiple new accounts in a short period of time may negatively impact your score.
Inquiries
An inquiry is recorded on your credit report whenever someone requests your credit report such as a lender, landlord or insurer. A large number of recent inquiries may negatively impact your score. Your new credit accounts and inquiries generally make up about 10% of your score.
Accounts in Use
The number of open accounts usually makes up approximately 10% of your score.
Receiving Your Free Credit Report
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires each of the nationwide credit reporting companies—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—to provide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months. A credit report includes information on where you live, how you pay your bills, and whether you've been sued or have filed for bankruptcy.
The three nationwide credit reporting companies above have set up a central website for your to request your report. You can order your free annual report by visiting the website, calling the toll&dash;free telephone number, or by mail through the mailing address below.

About Us














































Today
Because of engaged family-ownership, strong values and committed associates, you can expect Johnson Bank to be here for generations to come – providing expert advice to meet a lifetime’s worth of evolving financial needs in banking, wealth and insurance. 

2004
Sam passes away. His legacy of leadership, philanthropy and family values continues to inspire us all. Helen is named Chairman of Johnson Financial Group, representing the fifth generation of involved family leadership.                

2002
Johnson Financial Group’s new headquarters is completed in downtown Racine. Planned with a commitment to the environment and community in mind, the project – like several of the company’s building and renovation projects – helped revitalize the City’s downtown area.                

1998
Heritage Bank & Trust is renamed Johnson Bank, representing the family’s pride in the success and reputation of the business.                

1989
Johnson Trust Company is established, solidifying the bank’s niche expertise in wealth management. 

1987
Sam's daughter Helen Johnson-Leipold, begins working for the Bank. 

1985
Johnson Insurance Services is established.  Now one of the top independent insurance agencies in the nation, Johnson Insurance employs some of the industry's most respected specialists. 

1970
Disappointed by the traditional transactional service offered by most financial services companies, Sam opens Heritage Bank in Racine. He pledges to provide unmatched service by treating clients like family. 

1967
Sam is named Chairman of S.C. Johnson & Son, becoming the fourth generation to head the company.  Under his leadership, the business grows more than 20-fold and builds a global reputation as a champion of social responsibility, employee happiness and consumer loyalty. 

1954
Sam Johnson joins S.C. Johnson & Son, the oldest of the Johnson family’s businesses, as Assistant to the President. SC Johnson – along with Johnson Financial Group and Johnson Outdoors – are the Johnson family’s business enterprises headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin. Although they’re separate and independent companies, the businesses share the same core values and are leaders in their distinct, respective markets. Each is headed by a member of the fifth generation of Johnson family entrepreneurs. 









































For Generations
The story of Johnson Bank
Hear Our Story
In 1970, Samuel C. Johnson, fourth generation leader of one of the most successful privately&dash;owned companies in the world—SC Johnson—recognized the need for a different kind of bank.

Fixed and ARM Mortgage Loans | Johnson Bank


















































Fixed Rate & ARM Home Loans
You want to find the perfect house, but first you should look for the right mortgage. The right amount of prep work can make your home buying process a success. You have many loan options to choose from including fixed and adjustable rate loans.
Fixed Rate Mortgage
With a fixed rate mortgage, your monthly principal and interest payments remain the same throughout the life of the loan. Most common fixed rate terms range from 10 to 30 years. If you plan on staying in your home for several years, you may find that a fixed rate mortgage is right for you.
Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)
Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) generally have monthly principal and interest payments that change after a set period of time, based on an external financial index. ARMs may offer a variety of features, such as lower rates, caps on interest, and conversion options. If you plan on relocating or trading up in a few years, you may want to take advantage of an adjustable rate mortgage.
Get pre&dash;approved right now
Knowing how much you can afford ahead of time will help you focus on your search for the perfect house. Unlike prequalifying, which is only an estimate of how much a bank will lend you based on information you have provided, a pre&dash;approval is based on a review of your credit, employment history, assets, and liabilities. This will help you determine in what price range you should look and help ensure you don't lose the home of your dreams because you weren't able to secure a loan. In some cases, a pre-approval can even make you more attractive to the seller if there are multiple bids on the same house.
