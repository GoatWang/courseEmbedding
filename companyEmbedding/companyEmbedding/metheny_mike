Matheny playing for the San Francisco Giants in 2006.


Michael Scott Matheny (born September 22, 1970) is an American former professional baseball catcher and the current manager of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), a position he has held since 2012.[1][2] A product of the University of Michigan, Matheny was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut for the Brewers in 1994 and retired in 2006 with the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Cardinals during his thirteen-year catching career.
Though not a prodigious hitter, Matheny was one of the most accomplished defensive catchers of his era, winning four Rawlings Gold Glove Awards.[3][4] Further, he established major league records among catchers for consecutive games played without committing an error (252), and consecutive chances fielded without an error (1,565). Matheny is one of only three Major League catchers with an errorless season of at least 100 games,[5] and he set a Giants single-season team record in 2005 for catcher's fielding percentage at .999. He retired from playing due to persisting concussion symptoms, and has since become an advocate for its prevention and for improved catcher safety.
After his playing career, Matheny coached Little League Baseball. The Cardinals hired him to manage following the 2011 season in spite of having no previous professional experience. In 2015, he became the first manager in MLB history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons, and, in 2014, just the fifth to a League Championship Series appearance in each of his first three. His furthest title claim occurred in 2013, when the Cardinals won the National League pennant, only to fall to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.

Early life and amateur career[edit]
Matheny grew up in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, just minutes from the city of Columbus. He graduated from Reynoldsburg High School, where he captained the baseball and football teams.[2] Receiving little attention from nearby Ohio State University, University of Michigan coach Bud Middaugh offered him a scholarship to attend Michigan.[6]
Because of his defensive and throwing skills, Matheny drew the notice of major league scouts while in high school. The Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the 31st round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft but waited two days until after the draft ended to inform Matheny they had chosen him. At first, they refused to disclose to him in which round they had selected him.[6]
Two days before he was due to attend his first class, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny's home to convince him to sign. Gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for second-round picks. During that time, teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year. The Blue Jays constantly called Matheny until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign.[6]
Confounded by the Blue Jays' overtures, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Prior to proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them that he decided to attend the University of Michigan. At Michigan, Matheny co-captained the Wolverines baseball team.[7][8] He was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team.[2]
Playing career (1991–2006)[edit]
Minor leagues, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto Blue Jays (1991–99)[edit]
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Matheny in the eighth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft and he spent three years climbing the minor league system.[9][10] He made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 7, 1994 at the age of 23; he became their starting catcher early in the next season.[1][11]
During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1998, Matheny was batting in the bottom of the ninth when he took a pitch from Rich Loiselle off his face. Remaining upright, Matheny placed his hand on his hip as Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and home plate umpire Jerry Crawford motioned wildly for the Brewers trainers. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he walked off the field.[12] At the end of that season, he became eligible for salary arbitration and the Brewers granted him free agency a few months later.[13]
Ten years after they drafted him, the Toronto Blue Jays signed on December 23, 1998, for the 1999 season. He served as Darrin Fletcher's understudy. Gillick had resigned in 1994, however. Toronto released him after the season, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 15, 1999.
St. Louis Cardinals (2000–04)[edit]
Matheny barely made the Cardinals roster after the spring training session, but went on to earn the starting catcher's role in the 2000 season.[14] He posted a career-high .261 batting average and provided exceptional defense for the Cardinals, with a .993 fielding percentage and throwing out 53% of would-be base stealers, well above the league average of 32%.[15] Matheny helped the Cardinals improve from their fourth-place finish in 1999 to capturing the National League Central Division title, and claimed his first Gold Glove award in the process.[16] After the season, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $9-million contract.[14]
After teammate Darryl Kile's sudden death in the summer of 2002, Matheny showed that he was "an inspirational leader," helping the team to cope and make it to the National League Championship Series. After the 2003 season, the St. Louis and Houston chapters of the BBWAA voted for Matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in Kile's honor.[2]
Bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher, Matheny again won Gold Gloves with the Cardinals in 2003 and 2004. His defensive contributions helped St. Louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team, including claiming the National League pennant in 2004.[3][17] Between August 1, 2002 and August 4, 2004, Matheny played in 252 games without committing an error, establishing a new Major League record for catchers.[5]
Matheny set another Major League record for catchers in 2004 by fielding 1,565 consecutive chances without an error.[5] During his playing days in a Cardinal uniform, Matheny caught 611 games, accumulating 4,938.1 innings and committing just 14 errors.[2] His .997 fielding percentage leads all catchers who have caught at least 2,000 innings for St. Louis.[18] He became a free agent after the 2004 World Series, primarily due to the emergence of rookie catcher Yadier Molina, with whom he would eventually be reunited.
San Francisco Giants (2005–06)[edit]
Matheny signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 13, 2004. The next season, he displayed a rare power surge, amassing career-highs with 13 home runs, 34 doubles, a .406 slugging percentage and 59 runs batted in (RBIs). Matheny continued his defensive excellence, compiling a team-record .999 fielding percentage and leading National League catchers with 13 double plays, 77 assists and 39 would-be base-stealers caught stealing, earning his fourth Gold Glove.[1][2] He also took home the Willie Mac Award that year, accorded annually to a San Francisco Giant for spirit and leadership.[19]
Matheny landed on the disabled list on May 31, 2006 after a series of foul balls caromed off his mask, resulting in a serious concussion.[20] In July, the Giants announced that he would not return for the remainder of the season and that his career status was in doubt. MLB.com's Giants beat writer, Rich Draper, articulated that Matheny's career was likely over due to continued struggles with post-concussion syndrome.[21]
Retirement and career statistics[edit]
On February 1, 2007, Matheny announced his retirement from Major League Baseball at the age of 35 due to on-going symptoms of post-concussion syndrome.[5] Shortly thereafter, Matheny became a baseball mentor for Protégé Sports and filming some catching tips and drills for the Scottsdale-based company.
In his thirteen-year major league career, Matheny played in 1,305 games, accumulating 925 hits in 3,877 at bats for a .239 career batting average along with 67 home runs, 443 RBIs and an on-base percentage of .293.[1] He led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was 4 points above the league average during his playing career.[1] His .994 career fielding percentage ranks tenth all-time among Major League catchers.[22] Matheny also twice led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing.[1]
Managerial career (2012–present)[edit]




Matheny as manager of the Cardinals.


On January 24, 2008, Matheny returned to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following Tony La Russa's retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues.[23] The move was seen as unexpected as Matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor. Moreover, he was taking over a team that had just won the World Series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history. Matheny's other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues.[24] In spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors, Matheny guided the Cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and NLCS appearance in each of his first three seasons, becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this.[25]
First season as manager (2012)[edit]
On April 4, 2012, Matheny won in his managerial debut against the Miami Marlins in the first game of their new ballpark.[26] Twenty days later, Matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safe/out call by umpire Bill Welke in the bottom of the 10th inning of a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs.[27]
In another contest against the Marlins later that season, a bungled double switch left Matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings. Incidentally, that pitcher catalyzed a St. Louis victory in his role as a batter. With the score tied 6–6 in the bottom of the ninth inning at Marlins Park on June 25, Matheny presented the action to home plate umpire Bob Davidson to place relief pitcher Víctor Marte in the game for fellow pitcher Sam Freeman. Simultaneously, infielder Tyler Greene substituted for third baseman David Freese, originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup. Matheny assigned Greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which Freeman previously occupied – and play second base. The second baseman already in the game, Daniel Descalso, shifted to third base. Matheny showed Davidson these actions on the lineup card, and, with Davidson looking on, wrote "5" (used to designate the position of the third baseman) next to Descalso's name.
When Davidson conveyed the changes to Marlins manager Ozzie Guillén, a communication error transpired. After Marte faced one batter, Guillén vaulted from the Marlins dugout to argue that Marte and first baseman Allen Craig, the number five hitter, "couldn't be on the field at the same time." Despite his effort to oppose Guillén's protest, Davidson ruled for Matheny to remove Craig. He substituted Tony Cruz at first base, erasing two of the Cardinals' top hitters, Craig and Freese, from the game.[28] In the top of the tenth, Marte was due in Craig's fifth spot. With no regular batters remaining, Matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for Marte, rookie pitcher Joe Kelly. The Cardinals had gained the lead, 7–6, at this point and Kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs. He beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and RBI – and put the Cardinals up 8–6. This run proved to be crucial insurance as Miami's Omar Infante scored on a John Buck single in the bottom of the tenth. Nevertheless, Jason Motte, Kelly's replacement, closed it out for the 8–7 win.[29][30][31]
Matheny's first season as Cardinals manager was an overall success, finishing the regular season with an 88–74 record en route to capturing the National League wild-card game and qualifying for the postseason. The Giants defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[32]
2013–present[edit]




Matheny presents lineup card.


On February 14, 2013, the Cardinals picked up Matheny's 2014 option.[33] He surpassed the success of his first season by guiding the club in 2013 a 97–65 record, the best record in the National League and his first National League Central division title. The Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–2 in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2 in the NLCS for his first NL pennant. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series in six games, as was the case in 2004. With Matheny as the regular catcher, the Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series after a regular season with the best record in the NL. However, in 2013, St. Louis lost four key players to season-ending injuries – including Chris Carpenter, Rafael Furcal, Jaime García and Jason Motte – rookies comprised half of the World Series pitching staff.[34] On November 20, 2013, the Cardinals extended his contract for three more years through 2017.[35]
Making his first All-Star appearance as a major leaguer, Matheny was the National League manager in the 2014 game, which the American League won, 5–3.[36] The Cardinals won the NL Central division title in 2014, their second consecutive title, and third consecutive playoff appearance with Matheny as manager.[25] More trends continued as they eliminated the Dodgers from the playoffs for the second consecutive season, this time in the NLDS. As was the ending in 2012, the Giants eliminated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[37]
Tragedy struck to open the 2014–15 off-season when rookie right fielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic on October 26, 2014. Just 10 days after the completion of the NLCS,[38][39] news outlets reported the incident moments before the first pitch of Game 5 of the World Series.[40] It was the second death of an active Cardinals player during Mantheny's Cardinals career, following Kile's death in 2002. Reports confirmed alcohol intoxication on Taveras' part.[41] General manager John Mozeliak lamented the circumstances, amplifying that the team would take a greater role in instructing young players "to avoid reckless actions."[42]
After defeating the Chicago Cubs 10–9 on May 4, 2015, the Cardinals sported an MLB-best 19–6 record, which was the best 25-game start for the club since at least 1900.[43] Having won seven in a row, it established a career high for Matheny.[44] The Cardinals defeated the Cubs again the next game, 7–4, extending the win streak to eight.[45] A 3–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on May 17, 2015, securing the 300th win of his managerial career.[46] In August 2015, Baseball America published that fellow managers and coaches in the National League rated Matheny the second-best manager in the league.[47] On September 19, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to advance to the playoffs. Matheny became the first manager in MLB history to guide his club to the postseason in each of his first four full seasons.[48][49] With an 11–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, the Cardinals won 100 games for the first time in Matheny's managerial career, while clinching their third consecutive NL Central division title. The Pirates, who had kept close for most of the season, had already won 96 games, while clinching a wild-card berth.[50][51] However, the Cubs, the second wild card entrant, defeated the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games.[52] Matheny finished second in the NL Manager of the Year Award voting,[53] and a co-winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award.[54]
On May 27, 2016, Matheny gained his 400th career win in a 6–2 defeat of the Washington Nationals. In 2016 Matheny's contract was extended to 2022.[55]

Leadership and skills profile[edit]
Because the Cardinals had hired Matheny as manager following the 2011 season, questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one, particularly because he succeeded a World Series-winning manager of 33 years in La Russa. Matheny had never been a full-time coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball. However, he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days, as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader. He became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players' flaws, especially with the media. Fans and media have questioned his tactical skills, but, due to his experience playing a position (catcher) that imputes the requirement for leadership, it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure.[57]
However, with the success of his first two seasons, it became apparent Matheny was a good choice to manage the Cardinals. Said former Cardinal and veteran Lance Berkman, "People make a big deal out of not having coached or managed. ... You can take a guy with no people skills, no leadership ability, let him manage in the minor leagues for 20 years, and he'll never be ready to manage at the major league level. And you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles, put him in the big leagues, and he can be a Hall of Fame manager."[58]
Matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership, one central tenet of which is to be accessible, and to enable one's subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them.[57] In one of his blogs, Matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve.[59] Well before becoming manager, Matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics. Matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players.[57]
The Cardinals' hiring of Matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience, but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the Detroit Tigers' hiring of Brad Ausmus for their managerial position late in 2013. Similarly, Ausmus replaced a legendary manager in Jim Leyland.[60][61][62][63]

Personal life[edit]
Matheny is married to his wife, Kristen.[6] Kristen Matheny is a former field hockey player at Michigan. The couple have five children: one daughter, Katie, and four sons, Michael "Tate", Luke, Jacob and Blaise. Tate played college baseball at Missouri State University and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the 2015 MLB Draft.[65][66] Daughter Katie plays hockey at Ohio State.[67] Son Luke pitches at Oklahoma State University.[68] Matheny majored in sports management and communications with an emphasis in Spanish.[69]
Matheny routinely chronicles his life experiences and maintains a blog of which topics includes leadership and changing the culture of youth sports.[57][70] He is a Christian, and has spoken about his faith, saying, "... Jesus Christ is at the center of my life. [My faith is] all that I am, every day, every decision that I make."[71] He has been known to add a verse from the Bible to his autographs. Under his name, he includes either "John 3:16" or "John 3:17."[72]
Charity work[edit]
Matheny organized and created the Catch-22 charity (named for his playing position and uniform number) which donated tickets for Cardinals games between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Matheny opened a "Catch 22" field at the Chesterfield Valley Athletic complex in Chesterfield, Missouri.[2] The field has a completely flat and firm rubber surface and other features to allow children with a wide array of physical and mental handicaps to participate. [2][73]
Real estate ventures[edit]
The aftermath of unprofitable real estate transactions left Matheny heavily in debt. In 2005, Matheny had founded MPD Partnership with two indoor soccer players, Daryl Doran and Brett Phillips. This venture proved successful as they purchased a block of the WingHaven Develop in St. Charles and gained a $2.4 million profit after six months. Doran separated from the partnership to start a gym. Matheny and Phillips then used the income to secure an $11.8 million loan for an eleven-acre tract near Interstate 64.[74] He lost a 17-room house in Wildwood, Missouri, following insolvency on two commercial plots in near Chesterfield Valley. These plots did not sustain tenants and the value deflated after the financial crisis of 2007–08. His debts exceed $4 million and the amount of liability depended on the outcome of lawsuits involving the defaulted loans.[75] Matheny's attorney, Robert Blitz, is handling a similar case: Fischer and Frichtel, a homebuilder who also defaulted on assets after sustaining losses over the same time period, contends that they should not be fully liable for what is termed as "deflationary debt." The St. Louis appellate court deferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri.[76] In January 2013, a circuit court ruling determined that the Matheny partnership owed The Business Bank of St. Louis $4.4 million despite economic conditions and the bank's decision to stop loaning money to Matheny.[74]

Career highlights and awards




4× Gold Glove Award (2000, 2003–2005)








Matheny playing for the San Francisco Giants in 2006.


Michael Scott Matheny (born September 22, 1970) is an American former professional baseball catcher and the current manager of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), a position he has held since 2012.[1][2] A product of the University of Michigan, Matheny was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut for the Brewers in 1994 and retired in 2006 with the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Cardinals during his thirteen-year catching career.
Though not a prodigious hitter, Matheny was one of the most accomplished defensive catchers of his era, winning four Rawlings Gold Glove Awards.[3][4] Further, he established major league records among catchers for consecutive games played without committing an error (252), and consecutive chances fielded without an error (1,565). Matheny is one of only three Major League catchers with an errorless season of at least 100 games,[5] and he set a Giants single-season team record in 2005 for catcher's fielding percentage at .999. He retired from playing due to persisting concussion symptoms, and has since become an advocate for its prevention and for improved catcher safety.
After his playing career, Matheny coached Little League Baseball. The Cardinals hired him to manage following the 2011 season in spite of having no previous professional experience. In 2015, he became the first manager in MLB history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons, and, in 2014, just the fifth to a League Championship Series appearance in each of his first three. His furthest title claim occurred in 2013, when the Cardinals won the National League pennant, only to fall to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.

Early life and amateur career[edit]
Matheny grew up in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, just minutes from the city of Columbus. He graduated from Reynoldsburg High School, where he captained the baseball and football teams.[2] Receiving little attention from nearby Ohio State University, University of Michigan coach Bud Middaugh offered him a scholarship to attend Michigan.[6]
Because of his defensive and throwing skills, Matheny drew the notice of major league scouts while in high school. The Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the 31st round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft but waited two days until after the draft ended to inform Matheny they had chosen him. At first, they refused to disclose to him in which round they had selected him.[6]
Two days before he was due to attend his first class, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny's home to convince him to sign. Gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for second-round picks. During that time, teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year. The Blue Jays constantly called Matheny until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign.[6]
Confounded by the Blue Jays' overtures, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Prior to proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them that he decided to attend the University of Michigan. At Michigan, Matheny co-captained the Wolverines baseball team.[7][8] He was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team.[2]
Playing career (1991–2006)[edit]
Minor leagues, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto Blue Jays (1991–99)[edit]
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Matheny in the eighth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft and he spent three years climbing the minor league system.[9][10] He made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 7, 1994 at the age of 23; he became their starting catcher early in the next season.[1][11]
During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1998, Matheny was batting in the bottom of the ninth when he took a pitch from Rich Loiselle off his face. Remaining upright, Matheny placed his hand on his hip as Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and home plate umpire Jerry Crawford motioned wildly for the Brewers trainers. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he walked off the field.[12] At the end of that season, he became eligible for salary arbitration and the Brewers granted him free agency a few months later.[13]
Ten years after they drafted him, the Toronto Blue Jays signed on December 23, 1998, for the 1999 season. He served as Darrin Fletcher's understudy. Gillick had resigned in 1994, however. Toronto released him after the season, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 15, 1999.
St. Louis Cardinals (2000–04)[edit]
Matheny barely made the Cardinals roster after the spring training session, but went on to earn the starting catcher's role in the 2000 season.[14] He posted a career-high .261 batting average and provided exceptional defense for the Cardinals, with a .993 fielding percentage and throwing out 53% of would-be base stealers, well above the league average of 32%.[15] Matheny helped the Cardinals improve from their fourth-place finish in 1999 to capturing the National League Central Division title, and claimed his first Gold Glove award in the process.[16] After the season, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $9-million contract.[14]
After teammate Darryl Kile's sudden death in the summer of 2002, Matheny showed that he was "an inspirational leader," helping the team to cope and make it to the National League Championship Series. After the 2003 season, the St. Louis and Houston chapters of the BBWAA voted for Matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in Kile's honor.[2]
Bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher, Matheny again won Gold Gloves with the Cardinals in 2003 and 2004. His defensive contributions helped St. Louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team, including claiming the National League pennant in 2004.[3][17] Between August 1, 2002 and August 4, 2004, Matheny played in 252 games without committing an error, establishing a new Major League record for catchers.[5]
Matheny set another Major League record for catchers in 2004 by fielding 1,565 consecutive chances without an error.[5] During his playing days in a Cardinal uniform, Matheny caught 611 games, accumulating 4,938.1 innings and committing just 14 errors.[2] His .997 fielding percentage leads all catchers who have caught at least 2,000 innings for St. Louis.[18] He became a free agent after the 2004 World Series, primarily due to the emergence of rookie catcher Yadier Molina, with whom he would eventually be reunited.
San Francisco Giants (2005–06)[edit]
Matheny signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 13, 2004. The next season, he displayed a rare power surge, amassing career-highs with 13 home runs, 34 doubles, a .406 slugging percentage and 59 runs batted in (RBIs). Matheny continued his defensive excellence, compiling a team-record .999 fielding percentage and leading National League catchers with 13 double plays, 77 assists and 39 would-be base-stealers caught stealing, earning his fourth Gold Glove.[1][2] He also took home the Willie Mac Award that year, accorded annually to a San Francisco Giant for spirit and leadership.[19]
Matheny landed on the disabled list on May 31, 2006 after a series of foul balls caromed off his mask, resulting in a serious concussion.[20] In July, the Giants announced that he would not return for the remainder of the season and that his career status was in doubt. MLB.com's Giants beat writer, Rich Draper, articulated that Matheny's career was likely over due to continued struggles with post-concussion syndrome.[21]
Retirement and career statistics[edit]
On February 1, 2007, Matheny announced his retirement from Major League Baseball at the age of 35 due to on-going symptoms of post-concussion syndrome.[5] Shortly thereafter, Matheny became a baseball mentor for Protégé Sports and filming some catching tips and drills for the Scottsdale-based company.
In his thirteen-year major league career, Matheny played in 1,305 games, accumulating 925 hits in 3,877 at bats for a .239 career batting average along with 67 home runs, 443 RBIs and an on-base percentage of .293.[1] He led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was 4 points above the league average during his playing career.[1] His .994 career fielding percentage ranks tenth all-time among Major League catchers.[22] Matheny also twice led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing.[1]
Managerial career (2012–present)[edit]




Matheny as manager of the Cardinals.


On January 24, 2008, Matheny returned to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following Tony La Russa's retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues.[23] The move was seen as unexpected as Matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor. Moreover, he was taking over a team that had just won the World Series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history. Matheny's other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues.[24] In spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors, Matheny guided the Cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and NLCS appearance in each of his first three seasons, becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this.[25]
First season as manager (2012)[edit]
On April 4, 2012, Matheny won in his managerial debut against the Miami Marlins in the first game of their new ballpark.[26] Twenty days later, Matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safe/out call by umpire Bill Welke in the bottom of the 10th inning of a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs.[27]
In another contest against the Marlins later that season, a bungled double switch left Matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings. Incidentally, that pitcher catalyzed a St. Louis victory in his role as a batter. With the score tied 6–6 in the bottom of the ninth inning at Marlins Park on June 25, Matheny presented the action to home plate umpire Bob Davidson to place relief pitcher Víctor Marte in the game for fellow pitcher Sam Freeman. Simultaneously, infielder Tyler Greene substituted for third baseman David Freese, originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup. Matheny assigned Greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which Freeman previously occupied – and play second base. The second baseman already in the game, Daniel Descalso, shifted to third base. Matheny showed Davidson these actions on the lineup card, and, with Davidson looking on, wrote "5" (used to designate the position of the third baseman) next to Descalso's name.
When Davidson conveyed the changes to Marlins manager Ozzie Guillén, a communication error transpired. After Marte faced one batter, Guillén vaulted from the Marlins dugout to argue that Marte and first baseman Allen Craig, the number five hitter, "couldn't be on the field at the same time." Despite his effort to oppose Guillén's protest, Davidson ruled for Matheny to remove Craig. He substituted Tony Cruz at first base, erasing two of the Cardinals' top hitters, Craig and Freese, from the game.[28] In the top of the tenth, Marte was due in Craig's fifth spot. With no regular batters remaining, Matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for Marte, rookie pitcher Joe Kelly. The Cardinals had gained the lead, 7–6, at this point and Kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs. He beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and RBI – and put the Cardinals up 8–6. This run proved to be crucial insurance as Miami's Omar Infante scored on a John Buck single in the bottom of the tenth. Nevertheless, Jason Motte, Kelly's replacement, closed it out for the 8–7 win.[29][30][31]
Matheny's first season as Cardinals manager was an overall success, finishing the regular season with an 88–74 record en route to capturing the National League wild-card game and qualifying for the postseason. The Giants defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[32]
2013–present[edit]




Matheny presents lineup card.


On February 14, 2013, the Cardinals picked up Matheny's 2014 option.[33] He surpassed the success of his first season by guiding the club in 2013 a 97–65 record, the best record in the National League and his first National League Central division title. The Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–2 in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2 in the NLCS for his first NL pennant. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series in six games, as was the case in 2004. With Matheny as the regular catcher, the Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series after a regular season with the best record in the NL. However, in 2013, St. Louis lost four key players to season-ending injuries – including Chris Carpenter, Rafael Furcal, Jaime García and Jason Motte – rookies comprised half of the World Series pitching staff.[34] On November 20, 2013, the Cardinals extended his contract for three more years through 2017.[35]
Making his first All-Star appearance as a major leaguer, Matheny was the National League manager in the 2014 game, which the American League won, 5–3.[36] The Cardinals won the NL Central division title in 2014, their second consecutive title, and third consecutive playoff appearance with Matheny as manager.[25] More trends continued as they eliminated the Dodgers from the playoffs for the second consecutive season, this time in the NLDS. As was the ending in 2012, the Giants eliminated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[37]
Tragedy struck to open the 2014–15 off-season when rookie right fielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic on October 26, 2014. Just 10 days after the completion of the NLCS,[38][39] news outlets reported the incident moments before the first pitch of Game 5 of the World Series.[40] It was the second death of an active Cardinals player during Mantheny's Cardinals career, following Kile's death in 2002. Reports confirmed alcohol intoxication on Taveras' part.[41] General manager John Mozeliak lamented the circumstances, amplifying that the team would take a greater role in instructing young players "to avoid reckless actions."[42]
After defeating the Chicago Cubs 10–9 on May 4, 2015, the Cardinals sported an MLB-best 19–6 record, which was the best 25-game start for the club since at least 1900.[43] Having won seven in a row, it established a career high for Matheny.[44] The Cardinals defeated the Cubs again the next game, 7–4, extending the win streak to eight.[45] A 3–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on May 17, 2015, securing the 300th win of his managerial career.[46] In August 2015, Baseball America published that fellow managers and coaches in the National League rated Matheny the second-best manager in the league.[47] On September 19, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to advance to the playoffs. Matheny became the first manager in MLB history to guide his club to the postseason in each of his first four full seasons.[48][49] With an 11–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, the Cardinals won 100 games for the first time in Matheny's managerial career, while clinching their third consecutive NL Central division title. The Pirates, who had kept close for most of the season, had already won 96 games, while clinching a wild-card berth.[50][51] However, the Cubs, the second wild card entrant, defeated the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games.[52] Matheny finished second in the NL Manager of the Year Award voting,[53] and a co-winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award.[54]
On May 27, 2016, Matheny gained his 400th career win in a 6–2 defeat of the Washington Nationals. In 2016 Matheny's contract was extended to 2022.[55]

Leadership and skills profile[edit]
Because the Cardinals had hired Matheny as manager following the 2011 season, questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one, particularly because he succeeded a World Series-winning manager of 33 years in La Russa. Matheny had never been a full-time coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball. However, he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days, as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader. He became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players' flaws, especially with the media. Fans and media have questioned his tactical skills, but, due to his experience playing a position (catcher) that imputes the requirement for leadership, it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure.[57]
However, with the success of his first two seasons, it became apparent Matheny was a good choice to manage the Cardinals. Said former Cardinal and veteran Lance Berkman, "People make a big deal out of not having coached or managed. ... You can take a guy with no people skills, no leadership ability, let him manage in the minor leagues for 20 years, and he'll never be ready to manage at the major league level. And you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles, put him in the big leagues, and he can be a Hall of Fame manager."[58]
Matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership, one central tenet of which is to be accessible, and to enable one's subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them.[57] In one of his blogs, Matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve.[59] Well before becoming manager, Matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics. Matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players.[57]
The Cardinals' hiring of Matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience, but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the Detroit Tigers' hiring of Brad Ausmus for their managerial position late in 2013. Similarly, Ausmus replaced a legendary manager in Jim Leyland.[60][61][62][63]

Personal life[edit]
Matheny is married to his wife, Kristen.[6] Kristen Matheny is a former field hockey player at Michigan. The couple have five children: one daughter, Katie, and four sons, Michael "Tate", Luke, Jacob and Blaise. Tate played college baseball at Missouri State University and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the 2015 MLB Draft.[65][66] Daughter Katie plays hockey at Ohio State.[67] Son Luke pitches at Oklahoma State University.[68] Matheny majored in sports management and communications with an emphasis in Spanish.[69]
Matheny routinely chronicles his life experiences and maintains a blog of which topics includes leadership and changing the culture of youth sports.[57][70] He is a Christian, and has spoken about his faith, saying, "... Jesus Christ is at the center of my life. [My faith is] all that I am, every day, every decision that I make."[71] He has been known to add a verse from the Bible to his autographs. Under his name, he includes either "John 3:16" or "John 3:17."[72]
Charity work[edit]
Matheny organized and created the Catch-22 charity (named for his playing position and uniform number) which donated tickets for Cardinals games between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Matheny opened a "Catch 22" field at the Chesterfield Valley Athletic complex in Chesterfield, Missouri.[2] The field has a completely flat and firm rubber surface and other features to allow children with a wide array of physical and mental handicaps to participate. [2][73]
Real estate ventures[edit]
The aftermath of unprofitable real estate transactions left Matheny heavily in debt. In 2005, Matheny had founded MPD Partnership with two indoor soccer players, Daryl Doran and Brett Phillips. This venture proved successful as they purchased a block of the WingHaven Develop in St. Charles and gained a $2.4 million profit after six months. Doran separated from the partnership to start a gym. Matheny and Phillips then used the income to secure an $11.8 million loan for an eleven-acre tract near Interstate 64.[74] He lost a 17-room house in Wildwood, Missouri, following insolvency on two commercial plots in near Chesterfield Valley. These plots did not sustain tenants and the value deflated after the financial crisis of 2007–08. His debts exceed $4 million and the amount of liability depended on the outcome of lawsuits involving the defaulted loans.[75] Matheny's attorney, Robert Blitz, is handling a similar case: Fischer and Frichtel, a homebuilder who also defaulted on assets after sustaining losses over the same time period, contends that they should not be fully liable for what is termed as "deflationary debt." The St. Louis appellate court deferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri.[76] In January 2013, a circuit court ruling determined that the Matheny partnership owed The Business Bank of St. Louis $4.4 million despite economic conditions and the bank's decision to stop loaning money to Matheny.[74]

Matheny playing for the San Francisco Giants in 2006.


Michael Scott Matheny (born September 22, 1970) is an American former professional baseball catcher and the current manager of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), a position he has held since 2012.[1][2] A product of the University of Michigan, Matheny was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut for the Brewers in 1994 and retired in 2006 with the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Cardinals during his thirteen-year catching career.
Though not a prodigious hitter, Matheny was one of the most accomplished defensive catchers of his era, winning four Rawlings Gold Glove Awards.[3][4] Further, he established major league records among catchers for consecutive games played without committing an error (252), and consecutive chances fielded without an error (1,565). Matheny is one of only three Major League catchers with an errorless season of at least 100 games,[5] and he set a Giants single-season team record in 2005 for catcher's fielding percentage at .999. He retired from playing due to persisting concussion symptoms, and has since become an advocate for its prevention and for improved catcher safety.
After his playing career, Matheny coached Little League Baseball. The Cardinals hired him to manage following the 2011 season in spite of having no previous professional experience. In 2015, he became the first manager in MLB history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons, and, in 2014, just the fifth to a League Championship Series appearance in each of his first three. His furthest title claim occurred in 2013, when the Cardinals won the National League pennant, only to fall to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.

Early life and amateur career[edit]
Matheny grew up in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, just minutes from the city of Columbus. He graduated from Reynoldsburg High School, where he captained the baseball and football teams.[2] Receiving little attention from nearby Ohio State University, University of Michigan coach Bud Middaugh offered him a scholarship to attend Michigan.[6]
Because of his defensive and throwing skills, Matheny drew the notice of major league scouts while in high school. The Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the 31st round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft but waited two days until after the draft ended to inform Matheny they had chosen him. At first, they refused to disclose to him in which round they had selected him.[6]
Two days before he was due to attend his first class, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny's home to convince him to sign. Gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for second-round picks. During that time, teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year. The Blue Jays constantly called Matheny until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign.[6]
Confounded by the Blue Jays' overtures, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Prior to proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them that he decided to attend the University of Michigan. At Michigan, Matheny co-captained the Wolverines baseball team.[7][8] He was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team.[2]
Playing career (1991–2006)[edit]
Minor leagues, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto Blue Jays (1991–99)[edit]
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Matheny in the eighth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft and he spent three years climbing the minor league system.[9][10] He made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 7, 1994 at the age of 23; he became their starting catcher early in the next season.[1][11]
During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1998, Matheny was batting in the bottom of the ninth when he took a pitch from Rich Loiselle off his face. Remaining upright, Matheny placed his hand on his hip as Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and home plate umpire Jerry Crawford motioned wildly for the Brewers trainers. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he walked off the field.[12] At the end of that season, he became eligible for salary arbitration and the Brewers granted him free agency a few months later.[13]
Ten years after they drafted him, the Toronto Blue Jays signed on December 23, 1998, for the 1999 season. He served as Darrin Fletcher's understudy. Gillick had resigned in 1994, however. Toronto released him after the season, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 15, 1999.
St. Louis Cardinals (2000–04)[edit]
Matheny barely made the Cardinals roster after the spring training session, but went on to earn the starting catcher's role in the 2000 season.[14] He posted a career-high .261 batting average and provided exceptional defense for the Cardinals, with a .993 fielding percentage and throwing out 53% of would-be base stealers, well above the league average of 32%.[15] Matheny helped the Cardinals improve from their fourth-place finish in 1999 to capturing the National League Central Division title, and claimed his first Gold Glove award in the process.[16] After the season, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $9-million contract.[14]
After teammate Darryl Kile's sudden death in the summer of 2002, Matheny showed that he was "an inspirational leader," helping the team to cope and make it to the National League Championship Series. After the 2003 season, the St. Louis and Houston chapters of the BBWAA voted for Matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in Kile's honor.[2]
Bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher, Matheny again won Gold Gloves with the Cardinals in 2003 and 2004. His defensive contributions helped St. Louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team, including claiming the National League pennant in 2004.[3][17] Between August 1, 2002 and August 4, 2004, Matheny played in 252 games without committing an error, establishing a new Major League record for catchers.[5]
Matheny set another Major League record for catchers in 2004 by fielding 1,565 consecutive chances without an error.[5] During his playing days in a Cardinal uniform, Matheny caught 611 games, accumulating 4,938.1 innings and committing just 14 errors.[2] His .997 fielding percentage leads all catchers who have caught at least 2,000 innings for St. Louis.[18] He became a free agent after the 2004 World Series, primarily due to the emergence of rookie catcher Yadier Molina, with whom he would eventually be reunited.
San Francisco Giants (2005–06)[edit]
Matheny signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 13, 2004. The next season, he displayed a rare power surge, amassing career-highs with 13 home runs, 34 doubles, a .406 slugging percentage and 59 runs batted in (RBIs). Matheny continued his defensive excellence, compiling a team-record .999 fielding percentage and leading National League catchers with 13 double plays, 77 assists and 39 would-be base-stealers caught stealing, earning his fourth Gold Glove.[1][2] He also took home the Willie Mac Award that year, accorded annually to a San Francisco Giant for spirit and leadership.[19]
Matheny landed on the disabled list on May 31, 2006 after a series of foul balls caromed off his mask, resulting in a serious concussion.[20] In July, the Giants announced that he would not return for the remainder of the season and that his career status was in doubt. MLB.com's Giants beat writer, Rich Draper, articulated that Matheny's career was likely over due to continued struggles with post-concussion syndrome.[21]
Retirement and career statistics[edit]
On February 1, 2007, Matheny announced his retirement from Major League Baseball at the age of 35 due to on-going symptoms of post-concussion syndrome.[5] Shortly thereafter, Matheny became a baseball mentor for Protégé Sports and filming some catching tips and drills for the Scottsdale-based company.
In his thirteen-year major league career, Matheny played in 1,305 games, accumulating 925 hits in 3,877 at bats for a .239 career batting average along with 67 home runs, 443 RBIs and an on-base percentage of .293.[1] He led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was 4 points above the league average during his playing career.[1] His .994 career fielding percentage ranks tenth all-time among Major League catchers.[22] Matheny also twice led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing.[1]
Managerial career (2012–present)[edit]




Matheny as manager of the Cardinals.


On January 24, 2008, Matheny returned to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following Tony La Russa's retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues.[23] The move was seen as unexpected as Matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor. Moreover, he was taking over a team that had just won the World Series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history. Matheny's other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues.[24] In spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors, Matheny guided the Cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and NLCS appearance in each of his first three seasons, becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this.[25]
First season as manager (2012)[edit]
On April 4, 2012, Matheny won in his managerial debut against the Miami Marlins in the first game of their new ballpark.[26] Twenty days later, Matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safe/out call by umpire Bill Welke in the bottom of the 10th inning of a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs.[27]
In another contest against the Marlins later that season, a bungled double switch left Matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings. Incidentally, that pitcher catalyzed a St. Louis victory in his role as a batter. With the score tied 6–6 in the bottom of the ninth inning at Marlins Park on June 25, Matheny presented the action to home plate umpire Bob Davidson to place relief pitcher Víctor Marte in the game for fellow pitcher Sam Freeman. Simultaneously, infielder Tyler Greene substituted for third baseman David Freese, originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup. Matheny assigned Greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which Freeman previously occupied – and play second base. The second baseman already in the game, Daniel Descalso, shifted to third base. Matheny showed Davidson these actions on the lineup card, and, with Davidson looking on, wrote "5" (used to designate the position of the third baseman) next to Descalso's name.
When Davidson conveyed the changes to Marlins manager Ozzie Guillén, a communication error transpired. After Marte faced one batter, Guillén vaulted from the Marlins dugout to argue that Marte and first baseman Allen Craig, the number five hitter, "couldn't be on the field at the same time." Despite his effort to oppose Guillén's protest, Davidson ruled for Matheny to remove Craig. He substituted Tony Cruz at first base, erasing two of the Cardinals' top hitters, Craig and Freese, from the game.[28] In the top of the tenth, Marte was due in Craig's fifth spot. With no regular batters remaining, Matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for Marte, rookie pitcher Joe Kelly. The Cardinals had gained the lead, 7–6, at this point and Kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs. He beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and RBI – and put the Cardinals up 8–6. This run proved to be crucial insurance as Miami's Omar Infante scored on a John Buck single in the bottom of the tenth. Nevertheless, Jason Motte, Kelly's replacement, closed it out for the 8–7 win.[29][30][31]
Matheny's first season as Cardinals manager was an overall success, finishing the regular season with an 88–74 record en route to capturing the National League wild-card game and qualifying for the postseason. The Giants defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[32]
2013–present[edit]




Matheny presents lineup card.


On February 14, 2013, the Cardinals picked up Matheny's 2014 option.[33] He surpassed the success of his first season by guiding the club in 2013 a 97–65 record, the best record in the National League and his first National League Central division title. The Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–2 in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2 in the NLCS for his first NL pennant. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series in six games, as was the case in 2004. With Matheny as the regular catcher, the Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series after a regular season with the best record in the NL. However, in 2013, St. Louis lost four key players to season-ending injuries – including Chris Carpenter, Rafael Furcal, Jaime García and Jason Motte – rookies comprised half of the World Series pitching staff.[34] On November 20, 2013, the Cardinals extended his contract for three more years through 2017.[35]
Making his first All-Star appearance as a major leaguer, Matheny was the National League manager in the 2014 game, which the American League won, 5–3.[36] The Cardinals won the NL Central division title in 2014, their second consecutive title, and third consecutive playoff appearance with Matheny as manager.[25] More trends continued as they eliminated the Dodgers from the playoffs for the second consecutive season, this time in the NLDS. As was the ending in 2012, the Giants eliminated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[37]
Tragedy struck to open the 2014–15 off-season when rookie right fielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic on October 26, 2014. Just 10 days after the completion of the NLCS,[38][39] news outlets reported the incident moments before the first pitch of Game 5 of the World Series.[40] It was the second death of an active Cardinals player during Mantheny's Cardinals career, following Kile's death in 2002. Reports confirmed alcohol intoxication on Taveras' part.[41] General manager John Mozeliak lamented the circumstances, amplifying that the team would take a greater role in instructing young players "to avoid reckless actions."[42]
After defeating the Chicago Cubs 10–9 on May 4, 2015, the Cardinals sported an MLB-best 19–6 record, which was the best 25-game start for the club since at least 1900.[43] Having won seven in a row, it established a career high for Matheny.[44] The Cardinals defeated the Cubs again the next game, 7–4, extending the win streak to eight.[45] A 3–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on May 17, 2015, securing the 300th win of his managerial career.[46] In August 2015, Baseball America published that fellow managers and coaches in the National League rated Matheny the second-best manager in the league.[47] On September 19, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to advance to the playoffs. Matheny became the first manager in MLB history to guide his club to the postseason in each of his first four full seasons.[48][49] With an 11–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, the Cardinals won 100 games for the first time in Matheny's managerial career, while clinching their third consecutive NL Central division title. The Pirates, who had kept close for most of the season, had already won 96 games, while clinching a wild-card berth.[50][51] However, the Cubs, the second wild card entrant, defeated the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games.[52] Matheny finished second in the NL Manager of the Year Award voting,[53] and a co-winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award.[54]
On May 27, 2016, Matheny gained his 400th career win in a 6–2 defeat of the Washington Nationals. In 2016 Matheny's contract was extended to 2022.[55]

Leadership and skills profile[edit]
Because the Cardinals had hired Matheny as manager following the 2011 season, questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one, particularly because he succeeded a World Series-winning manager of 33 years in La Russa. Matheny had never been a full-time coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball. However, he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days, as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader. He became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players' flaws, especially with the media. Fans and media have questioned his tactical skills, but, due to his experience playing a position (catcher) that imputes the requirement for leadership, it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure.[57]
However, with the success of his first two seasons, it became apparent Matheny was a good choice to manage the Cardinals. Said former Cardinal and veteran Lance Berkman, "People make a big deal out of not having coached or managed. ... You can take a guy with no people skills, no leadership ability, let him manage in the minor leagues for 20 years, and he'll never be ready to manage at the major league level. And you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles, put him in the big leagues, and he can be a Hall of Fame manager."[58]
Matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership, one central tenet of which is to be accessible, and to enable one's subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them.[57] In one of his blogs, Matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve.[59] Well before becoming manager, Matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics. Matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players.[57]
The Cardinals' hiring of Matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience, but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the Detroit Tigers' hiring of Brad Ausmus for their managerial position late in 2013. Similarly, Ausmus replaced a legendary manager in Jim Leyland.[60][61][62][63]

Personal life[edit]
Matheny is married to his wife, Kristen.[6] Kristen Matheny is a former field hockey player at Michigan. The couple have five children: one daughter, Katie, and four sons, Michael "Tate", Luke, Jacob and Blaise. Tate played college baseball at Missouri State University and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the 2015 MLB Draft.[65][66] Daughter Katie plays hockey at Ohio State.[67] Son Luke pitches at Oklahoma State University.[68] Matheny majored in sports management and communications with an emphasis in Spanish.[69]
Matheny routinely chronicles his life experiences and maintains a blog of which topics includes leadership and changing the culture of youth sports.[57][70] He is a Christian, and has spoken about his faith, saying, "... Jesus Christ is at the center of my life. [My faith is] all that I am, every day, every decision that I make."[71] He has been known to add a verse from the Bible to his autographs. Under his name, he includes either "John 3:16" or "John 3:17."[72]
Charity work[edit]
Matheny organized and created the Catch-22 charity (named for his playing position and uniform number) which donated tickets for Cardinals games between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Matheny opened a "Catch 22" field at the Chesterfield Valley Athletic complex in Chesterfield, Missouri.[2] The field has a completely flat and firm rubber surface and other features to allow children with a wide array of physical and mental handicaps to participate. [2][73]
Real estate ventures[edit]
The aftermath of unprofitable real estate transactions left Matheny heavily in debt. In 2005, Matheny had founded MPD Partnership with two indoor soccer players, Daryl Doran and Brett Phillips. This venture proved successful as they purchased a block of the WingHaven Develop in St. Charles and gained a $2.4 million profit after six months. Doran separated from the partnership to start a gym. Matheny and Phillips then used the income to secure an $11.8 million loan for an eleven-acre tract near Interstate 64.[74] He lost a 17-room house in Wildwood, Missouri, following insolvency on two commercial plots in near Chesterfield Valley. These plots did not sustain tenants and the value deflated after the financial crisis of 2007–08. His debts exceed $4 million and the amount of liability depended on the outcome of lawsuits involving the defaulted loans.[75] Matheny's attorney, Robert Blitz, is handling a similar case: Fischer and Frichtel, a homebuilder who also defaulted on assets after sustaining losses over the same time period, contends that they should not be fully liable for what is termed as "deflationary debt." The St. Louis appellate court deferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri.[76] In January 2013, a circuit court ruling determined that the Matheny partnership owed The Business Bank of St. Louis $4.4 million despite economic conditions and the bank's decision to stop loaning money to Matheny.[74]

Career highlights and awards




4× Gold Glove Award (2000, 2003–2005)








Matheny playing for the San Francisco Giants in 2006.


Michael Scott Matheny (born September 22, 1970) is an American former professional baseball catcher and the current manager of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), a position he has held since 2012.[1][2] A product of the University of Michigan, Matheny was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut for the Brewers in 1994 and retired in 2006 with the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Cardinals during his thirteen-year catching career.
Though not a prodigious hitter, Matheny was one of the most accomplished defensive catchers of his era, winning four Rawlings Gold Glove Awards.[3][4] Further, he established major league records among catchers for consecutive games played without committing an error (252), and consecutive chances fielded without an error (1,565). Matheny is one of only three Major League catchers with an errorless season of at least 100 games,[5] and he set a Giants single-season team record in 2005 for catcher's fielding percentage at .999. He retired from playing due to persisting concussion symptoms, and has since become an advocate for its prevention and for improved catcher safety.
After his playing career, Matheny coached Little League Baseball. The Cardinals hired him to manage following the 2011 season in spite of having no previous professional experience. In 2015, he became the first manager in MLB history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons, and, in 2014, just the fifth to a League Championship Series appearance in each of his first three. His furthest title claim occurred in 2013, when the Cardinals won the National League pennant, only to fall to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.

Early life and amateur career[edit]
Matheny grew up in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, just minutes from the city of Columbus. He graduated from Reynoldsburg High School, where he captained the baseball and football teams.[2] Receiving little attention from nearby Ohio State University, University of Michigan coach Bud Middaugh offered him a scholarship to attend Michigan.[6]
Because of his defensive and throwing skills, Matheny drew the notice of major league scouts while in high school. The Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the 31st round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft but waited two days until after the draft ended to inform Matheny they had chosen him. At first, they refused to disclose to him in which round they had selected him.[6]
Two days before he was due to attend his first class, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny's home to convince him to sign. Gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for second-round picks. During that time, teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year. The Blue Jays constantly called Matheny until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign.[6]
Confounded by the Blue Jays' overtures, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Prior to proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them that he decided to attend the University of Michigan. At Michigan, Matheny co-captained the Wolverines baseball team.[7][8] He was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team.[2]
Playing career (1991–2006)[edit]
Minor leagues, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto Blue Jays (1991–99)[edit]
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Matheny in the eighth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft and he spent three years climbing the minor league system.[9][10] He made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 7, 1994 at the age of 23; he became their starting catcher early in the next season.[1][11]
During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1998, Matheny was batting in the bottom of the ninth when he took a pitch from Rich Loiselle off his face. Remaining upright, Matheny placed his hand on his hip as Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and home plate umpire Jerry Crawford motioned wildly for the Brewers trainers. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he walked off the field.[12] At the end of that season, he became eligible for salary arbitration and the Brewers granted him free agency a few months later.[13]
Ten years after they drafted him, the Toronto Blue Jays signed on December 23, 1998, for the 1999 season. He served as Darrin Fletcher's understudy. Gillick had resigned in 1994, however. Toronto released him after the season, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 15, 1999.
St. Louis Cardinals (2000–04)[edit]
Matheny barely made the Cardinals roster after the spring training session, but went on to earn the starting catcher's role in the 2000 season.[14] He posted a career-high .261 batting average and provided exceptional defense for the Cardinals, with a .993 fielding percentage and throwing out 53% of would-be base stealers, well above the league average of 32%.[15] Matheny helped the Cardinals improve from their fourth-place finish in 1999 to capturing the National League Central Division title, and claimed his first Gold Glove award in the process.[16] After the season, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $9-million contract.[14]
After teammate Darryl Kile's sudden death in the summer of 2002, Matheny showed that he was "an inspirational leader," helping the team to cope and make it to the National League Championship Series. After the 2003 season, the St. Louis and Houston chapters of the BBWAA voted for Matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in Kile's honor.[2]
Bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher, Matheny again won Gold Gloves with the Cardinals in 2003 and 2004. His defensive contributions helped St. Louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team, including claiming the National League pennant in 2004.[3][17] Between August 1, 2002 and August 4, 2004, Matheny played in 252 games without committing an error, establishing a new Major League record for catchers.[5]
Matheny set another Major League record for catchers in 2004 by fielding 1,565 consecutive chances without an error.[5] During his playing days in a Cardinal uniform, Matheny caught 611 games, accumulating 4,938.1 innings and committing just 14 errors.[2] His .997 fielding percentage leads all catchers who have caught at least 2,000 innings for St. Louis.[18] He became a free agent after the 2004 World Series, primarily due to the emergence of rookie catcher Yadier Molina, with whom he would eventually be reunited.
San Francisco Giants (2005–06)[edit]
Matheny signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 13, 2004. The next season, he displayed a rare power surge, amassing career-highs with 13 home runs, 34 doubles, a .406 slugging percentage and 59 runs batted in (RBIs). Matheny continued his defensive excellence, compiling a team-record .999 fielding percentage and leading National League catchers with 13 double plays, 77 assists and 39 would-be base-stealers caught stealing, earning his fourth Gold Glove.[1][2] He also took home the Willie Mac Award that year, accorded annually to a San Francisco Giant for spirit and leadership.[19]
Matheny landed on the disabled list on May 31, 2006 after a series of foul balls caromed off his mask, resulting in a serious concussion.[20] In July, the Giants announced that he would not return for the remainder of the season and that his career status was in doubt. MLB.com's Giants beat writer, Rich Draper, articulated that Matheny's career was likely over due to continued struggles with post-concussion syndrome.[21]
Retirement and career statistics[edit]
On February 1, 2007, Matheny announced his retirement from Major League Baseball at the age of 35 due to on-going symptoms of post-concussion syndrome.[5] Shortly thereafter, Matheny became a baseball mentor for Protégé Sports and filming some catching tips and drills for the Scottsdale-based company.
In his thirteen-year major league career, Matheny played in 1,305 games, accumulating 925 hits in 3,877 at bats for a .239 career batting average along with 67 home runs, 443 RBIs and an on-base percentage of .293.[1] He led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was 4 points above the league average during his playing career.[1] His .994 career fielding percentage ranks tenth all-time among Major League catchers.[22] Matheny also twice led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing.[1]
Managerial career (2012–present)[edit]




Matheny as manager of the Cardinals.


On January 24, 2008, Matheny returned to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following Tony La Russa's retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues.[23] The move was seen as unexpected as Matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor. Moreover, he was taking over a team that had just won the World Series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history. Matheny's other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues.[24] In spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors, Matheny guided the Cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and NLCS appearance in each of his first three seasons, becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this.[25]
First season as manager (2012)[edit]
On April 4, 2012, Matheny won in his managerial debut against the Miami Marlins in the first game of their new ballpark.[26] Twenty days later, Matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safe/out call by umpire Bill Welke in the bottom of the 10th inning of a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs.[27]
In another contest against the Marlins later that season, a bungled double switch left Matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings. Incidentally, that pitcher catalyzed a St. Louis victory in his role as a batter. With the score tied 6–6 in the bottom of the ninth inning at Marlins Park on June 25, Matheny presented the action to home plate umpire Bob Davidson to place relief pitcher Víctor Marte in the game for fellow pitcher Sam Freeman. Simultaneously, infielder Tyler Greene substituted for third baseman David Freese, originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup. Matheny assigned Greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which Freeman previously occupied – and play second base. The second baseman already in the game, Daniel Descalso, shifted to third base. Matheny showed Davidson these actions on the lineup card, and, with Davidson looking on, wrote "5" (used to designate the position of the third baseman) next to Descalso's name.
When Davidson conveyed the changes to Marlins manager Ozzie Guillén, a communication error transpired. After Marte faced one batter, Guillén vaulted from the Marlins dugout to argue that Marte and first baseman Allen Craig, the number five hitter, "couldn't be on the field at the same time." Despite his effort to oppose Guillén's protest, Davidson ruled for Matheny to remove Craig. He substituted Tony Cruz at first base, erasing two of the Cardinals' top hitters, Craig and Freese, from the game.[28] In the top of the tenth, Marte was due in Craig's fifth spot. With no regular batters remaining, Matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for Marte, rookie pitcher Joe Kelly. The Cardinals had gained the lead, 7–6, at this point and Kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs. He beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and RBI – and put the Cardinals up 8–6. This run proved to be crucial insurance as Miami's Omar Infante scored on a John Buck single in the bottom of the tenth. Nevertheless, Jason Motte, Kelly's replacement, closed it out for the 8–7 win.[29][30][31]
Matheny's first season as Cardinals manager was an overall success, finishing the regular season with an 88–74 record en route to capturing the National League wild-card game and qualifying for the postseason. The Giants defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[32]
2013–present[edit]




Matheny presents lineup card.


On February 14, 2013, the Cardinals picked up Matheny's 2014 option.[33] He surpassed the success of his first season by guiding the club in 2013 a 97–65 record, the best record in the National League and his first National League Central division title. The Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–2 in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2 in the NLCS for his first NL pennant. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series in six games, as was the case in 2004. With Matheny as the regular catcher, the Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series after a regular season with the best record in the NL. However, in 2013, St. Louis lost four key players to season-ending injuries – including Chris Carpenter, Rafael Furcal, Jaime García and Jason Motte – rookies comprised half of the World Series pitching staff.[34] On November 20, 2013, the Cardinals extended his contract for three more years through 2017.[35]
Making his first All-Star appearance as a major leaguer, Matheny was the National League manager in the 2014 game, which the American League won, 5–3.[36] The Cardinals won the NL Central division title in 2014, their second consecutive title, and third consecutive playoff appearance with Matheny as manager.[25] More trends continued as they eliminated the Dodgers from the playoffs for the second consecutive season, this time in the NLDS. As was the ending in 2012, the Giants eliminated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[37]
Tragedy struck to open the 2014–15 off-season when rookie right fielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic on October 26, 2014. Just 10 days after the completion of the NLCS,[38][39] news outlets reported the incident moments before the first pitch of Game 5 of the World Series.[40] It was the second death of an active Cardinals player during Mantheny's Cardinals career, following Kile's death in 2002. Reports confirmed alcohol intoxication on Taveras' part.[41] General manager John Mozeliak lamented the circumstances, amplifying that the team would take a greater role in instructing young players "to avoid reckless actions."[42]
After defeating the Chicago Cubs 10–9 on May 4, 2015, the Cardinals sported an MLB-best 19–6 record, which was the best 25-game start for the club since at least 1900.[43] Having won seven in a row, it established a career high for Matheny.[44] The Cardinals defeated the Cubs again the next game, 7–4, extending the win streak to eight.[45] A 3–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on May 17, 2015, securing the 300th win of his managerial career.[46] In August 2015, Baseball America published that fellow managers and coaches in the National League rated Matheny the second-best manager in the league.[47] On September 19, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to advance to the playoffs. Matheny became the first manager in MLB history to guide his club to the postseason in each of his first four full seasons.[48][49] With an 11–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, the Cardinals won 100 games for the first time in Matheny's managerial career, while clinching their third consecutive NL Central division title. The Pirates, who had kept close for most of the season, had already won 96 games, while clinching a wild-card berth.[50][51] However, the Cubs, the second wild card entrant, defeated the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games.[52] Matheny finished second in the NL Manager of the Year Award voting,[53] and a co-winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award.[54]
On May 27, 2016, Matheny gained his 400th career win in a 6–2 defeat of the Washington Nationals. In 2016 Matheny's contract was extended to 2022.[55]

Leadership and skills profile[edit]
Because the Cardinals had hired Matheny as manager following the 2011 season, questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one, particularly because he succeeded a World Series-winning manager of 33 years in La Russa. Matheny had never been a full-time coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball. However, he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days, as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader. He became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players' flaws, especially with the media. Fans and media have questioned his tactical skills, but, due to his experience playing a position (catcher) that imputes the requirement for leadership, it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure.[57]
However, with the success of his first two seasons, it became apparent Matheny was a good choice to manage the Cardinals. Said former Cardinal and veteran Lance Berkman, "People make a big deal out of not having coached or managed. ... You can take a guy with no people skills, no leadership ability, let him manage in the minor leagues for 20 years, and he'll never be ready to manage at the major league level. And you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles, put him in the big leagues, and he can be a Hall of Fame manager."[58]
Matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership, one central tenet of which is to be accessible, and to enable one's subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them.[57] In one of his blogs, Matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve.[59] Well before becoming manager, Matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics. Matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players.[57]
The Cardinals' hiring of Matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience, but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the Detroit Tigers' hiring of Brad Ausmus for their managerial position late in 2013. Similarly, Ausmus replaced a legendary manager in Jim Leyland.[60][61][62][63]

Personal life[edit]
Matheny is married to his wife, Kristen.[6] Kristen Matheny is a former field hockey player at Michigan. The couple have five children: one daughter, Katie, and four sons, Michael "Tate", Luke, Jacob and Blaise. Tate played college baseball at Missouri State University and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the 2015 MLB Draft.[65][66] Daughter Katie plays hockey at Ohio State.[67] Son Luke pitches at Oklahoma State University.[68] Matheny majored in sports management and communications with an emphasis in Spanish.[69]
Matheny routinely chronicles his life experiences and maintains a blog of which topics includes leadership and changing the culture of youth sports.[57][70] He is a Christian, and has spoken about his faith, saying, "... Jesus Christ is at the center of my life. [My faith is] all that I am, every day, every decision that I make."[71] He has been known to add a verse from the Bible to his autographs. Under his name, he includes either "John 3:16" or "John 3:17."[72]
Charity work[edit]
Matheny organized and created the Catch-22 charity (named for his playing position and uniform number) which donated tickets for Cardinals games between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Matheny opened a "Catch 22" field at the Chesterfield Valley Athletic complex in Chesterfield, Missouri.[2] The field has a completely flat and firm rubber surface and other features to allow children with a wide array of physical and mental handicaps to participate. [2][73]
Real estate ventures[edit]
The aftermath of unprofitable real estate transactions left Matheny heavily in debt. In 2005, Matheny had founded MPD Partnership with two indoor soccer players, Daryl Doran and Brett Phillips. This venture proved successful as they purchased a block of the WingHaven Develop in St. Charles and gained a $2.4 million profit after six months. Doran separated from the partnership to start a gym. Matheny and Phillips then used the income to secure an $11.8 million loan for an eleven-acre tract near Interstate 64.[74] He lost a 17-room house in Wildwood, Missouri, following insolvency on two commercial plots in near Chesterfield Valley. These plots did not sustain tenants and the value deflated after the financial crisis of 2007–08. His debts exceed $4 million and the amount of liability depended on the outcome of lawsuits involving the defaulted loans.[75] Matheny's attorney, Robert Blitz, is handling a similar case: Fischer and Frichtel, a homebuilder who also defaulted on assets after sustaining losses over the same time period, contends that they should not be fully liable for what is termed as "deflationary debt." The St. Louis appellate court deferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri.[76] In January 2013, a circuit court ruling determined that the Matheny partnership owed The Business Bank of St. Louis $4.4 million despite economic conditions and the bank's decision to stop loaning money to Matheny.[74]

Mike Matheny’s Record Will Be a Product Of Talent, Luck & Definitely Not Mike Matheny

Jeff Curry/Getty Images



MLB

November 14, 2011

The St. Louis Cardinals won two World Series under Tony La Russa. Only two managers ever won more games than La Russa. At the time of his retirement, La Russa’s 16 years with the Cardinals was the longest-running tenure for any manager with any team. Whatever one thought about La Russa’s personality or tactics as a manager, one thing was clear: The Cardinals believed in continuity, and TLR rewarded them for that belief.
Naturally, when the time came to replace La Russa, the Cardinals locked in on one candidate: Mike Matheny, the choice with exactly zero full-time managing or coaching experience, at any level.

Matheny’s hire might lead you to think the Cardinals are taking a huge risk by tapping a new skipper whose entire post-playing career experience with the Cardinals boiled down to a special adviser role for two weeks in spring training three years ago. But we’ve seen this before. Elias notes that five other first-time managers have taken over a defending World Series champion: Bill Carrigan (1913 Red Sox), Jack Barry (1917 Red Sox), and Bill Virdon (1972 Pirates), along with two Cardinals skippers, Bob O’Farrell (1927 Cardinals) and Red Schoendienst (1965 Cardinals).
Go back through baseball history, and you’ll find numerous other cases of zero-experience managers. In some instances, they failed spectacularly. In others, they succeeded.
About a month ago, Robin Ventura was hired by the White Sox with just scant coaching experience and no managing experience, but the best example we can judge also ranks as one of the worst. A.J. Hinch served four years in the Diamondbacks front office, the last three as director of player development. After Arizona’s slow start in 2009, Hinch got booted downstairs to manage the team. From May of that year until July 2010, the Diamondbacks compiled a brutal 89-123 record, despite fielding a nucleus that included several impressive, young players. When Kirk Gibson guided Arizona to the NL West title a year later, skeptics could have seen that success as a final affirmation of Hinch’s failures as skipper — though the Diamondbacks’ inability to build a functional bullpen, and some key players being a year or two away from breaking out, probably sealed Hinch’s fate more than anything.
Perhaps even odder than a move from front office to manager are the times teams looked to the broadcast booth to find their next skipper. After eight years calling games for the Padres, Jerry Coleman found his way into the manager’s chair in 1980. Granted just that one year at the helm, Coleman guided the Padres to a 73-89 record — no big surprise given how lousy the team had been a year earlier, when it actually won five fewer games. Larry Dierker was a color commentator for the Astros for 18 seasons before gaining the manager’s job in 1997. He enjoyed tremendous success, winning four division titles in five seasons (though with four first-round playoff exits). This, too, wasn’t a surprise, given a dynamic core that included future Hall of Famers Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio, and other stars.
Finally, we have a now-extinct brand of field general, the player-manager. Three of the most recent examples met with mixed results themselves. Frank Robinson became the Indians’ player-manager in 1975, then went on to finish three games below .500 over the ensuing three seasons (he saw better results later in his managerial career). Joe Torre took over as Mets player-manager in May 1977 (even though he played his final game earlier that month). Pete Rose compiled a solid 412-373 record as taking over as player-manager of the Reds in August 1984, though he’s best remembered for getting banned from baseball on charges that he gambled on his own team.
The common denominator here is, simply, talent level. Studies in the book Baseball Between the Numbers and elsewhere show that the vast majority of managers don’t make much of a difference to their teams one way or another over the long haul. Even in small-sample, high-pressure moments such as playoff games, their mistakes can lead to baseball miracles.
There are multiple reasons that may have driven the Cardinals to hire Matheny. There’s a long-standing belief within the game that catchers make great managers due to their supposed leadership and game-calling skills  even though we’ve yet to see compelling evidence that ex-catchers make significantly better managers than ex-second basemen or ex-rodeo clowns. Perhaps this was simply a case of Cardinals GM John Mozeliak going with the guy he liked the most, especially after a strong interview. Or maybe there’s a tiny chance that Albert Pujols might be persuaded to stay in St. Louis rather than leave via free agency, in part because his old teammate Matheny will be calling the shots, not some unknown outsider  though money will surely play a bigger role in the decision.
Ultimately, we have no way of knowing how this experiment might go, because Matheny offers no track record on which to peg our predictions. If you insist on reading the tea leaves, try this: If Pujols stays in St. Louis and remains a superstar throughout the bulk of his next contract; if Adam Wainwright returns to full strength after Tommy John surgery; if the Cardinals young bullpen, Shelby Miller, and other next-generation pieces come through, the Cardinals will probably look like geniuses. If they don’t, they probably won’t.
This might seem an unsatisfying answer to an elemental question. But to quote one very successful, very polarizing skipper, that’s the way baseball go.

Matheny playing for the San Francisco Giants in 2006.


Michael Scott Matheny (born September 22, 1970) is an American former professional baseball catcher and the current manager of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), a position he has held since 2012.[1][2] A product of the University of Michigan, Matheny was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut for the Brewers in 1994 and retired in 2006 with the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Cardinals during his thirteen-year catching career.
Though not a prodigious hitter, Matheny was one of the most accomplished defensive catchers of his era, winning four Rawlings Gold Glove Awards.[3][4] Further, he established major league records among catchers for consecutive games played without committing an error (252), and consecutive chances fielded without an error (1,565). Matheny is one of only three Major League catchers with an errorless season of at least 100 games,[5] and he set a Giants single-season team record in 2005 for catcher's fielding percentage at .999. He retired from playing due to persisting concussion symptoms, and has since become an advocate for its prevention and for improved catcher safety.
After his playing career, Matheny coached Little League Baseball. The Cardinals hired him to manage following the 2011 season in spite of having no previous professional experience. In 2015, he became the first manager in MLB history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons, and, in 2014, just the fifth to a League Championship Series appearance in each of his first three. His furthest title claim occurred in 2013, when the Cardinals won the National League pennant, only to fall to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.

Early life and amateur career[edit]
Matheny grew up in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, just minutes from the city of Columbus. He graduated from Reynoldsburg High School, where he captained the baseball and football teams.[2] Receiving little attention from nearby Ohio State University, University of Michigan coach Bud Middaugh offered him a scholarship to attend Michigan.[6]
Because of his defensive and throwing skills, Matheny drew the notice of major league scouts while in high school. The Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the 31st round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft but waited two days until after the draft ended to inform Matheny they had chosen him. At first, they refused to disclose to him in which round they had selected him.[6]
Two days before he was due to attend his first class, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny's home to convince him to sign. Gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for second-round picks. During that time, teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year. The Blue Jays constantly called Matheny until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign.[6]
Confounded by the Blue Jays' overtures, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Prior to proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them that he decided to attend the University of Michigan. At Michigan, Matheny co-captained the Wolverines baseball team.[7][8] He was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team.[2]
Playing career (1991–2006)[edit]
Minor leagues, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto Blue Jays (1991–99)[edit]
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Matheny in the eighth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft and he spent three years climbing the minor league system.[9][10] He made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 7, 1994 at the age of 23; he became their starting catcher early in the next season.[1][11]
During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1998, Matheny was batting in the bottom of the ninth when he took a pitch from Rich Loiselle off his face. Remaining upright, Matheny placed his hand on his hip as Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and home plate umpire Jerry Crawford motioned wildly for the Brewers trainers. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he walked off the field.[12] At the end of that season, he became eligible for salary arbitration and the Brewers granted him free agency a few months later.[13]
Ten years after they drafted him, the Toronto Blue Jays signed on December 23, 1998, for the 1999 season. He served as Darrin Fletcher's understudy. Gillick had resigned in 1994, however. Toronto released him after the season, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 15, 1999.
St. Louis Cardinals (2000–04)[edit]
Matheny barely made the Cardinals roster after the spring training session, but went on to earn the starting catcher's role in the 2000 season.[14] He posted a career-high .261 batting average and provided exceptional defense for the Cardinals, with a .993 fielding percentage and throwing out 53% of would-be base stealers, well above the league average of 32%.[15] Matheny helped the Cardinals improve from their fourth-place finish in 1999 to capturing the National League Central Division title, and claimed his first Gold Glove award in the process.[16] After the season, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $9-million contract.[14]
After teammate Darryl Kile's sudden death in the summer of 2002, Matheny showed that he was "an inspirational leader," helping the team to cope and make it to the National League Championship Series. After the 2003 season, the St. Louis and Houston chapters of the BBWAA voted for Matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in Kile's honor.[2]
Bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher, Matheny again won Gold Gloves with the Cardinals in 2003 and 2004. His defensive contributions helped St. Louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team, including claiming the National League pennant in 2004.[3][17] Between August 1, 2002 and August 4, 2004, Matheny played in 252 games without committing an error, establishing a new Major League record for catchers.[5]
Matheny set another Major League record for catchers in 2004 by fielding 1,565 consecutive chances without an error.[5] During his playing days in a Cardinal uniform, Matheny caught 611 games, accumulating 4,938.1 innings and committing just 14 errors.[2] His .997 fielding percentage leads all catchers who have caught at least 2,000 innings for St. Louis.[18] He became a free agent after the 2004 World Series, primarily due to the emergence of rookie catcher Yadier Molina, with whom he would eventually be reunited.
San Francisco Giants (2005–06)[edit]
Matheny signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 13, 2004. The next season, he displayed a rare power surge, amassing career-highs with 13 home runs, 34 doubles, a .406 slugging percentage and 59 runs batted in (RBIs). Matheny continued his defensive excellence, compiling a team-record .999 fielding percentage and leading National League catchers with 13 double plays, 77 assists and 39 would-be base-stealers caught stealing, earning his fourth Gold Glove.[1][2] He also took home the Willie Mac Award that year, accorded annually to a San Francisco Giant for spirit and leadership.[19]
Matheny landed on the disabled list on May 31, 2006 after a series of foul balls caromed off his mask, resulting in a serious concussion.[20] In July, the Giants announced that he would not return for the remainder of the season and that his career status was in doubt. MLB.com's Giants beat writer, Rich Draper, articulated that Matheny's career was likely over due to continued struggles with post-concussion syndrome.[21]
Retirement and career statistics[edit]
On February 1, 2007, Matheny announced his retirement from Major League Baseball at the age of 35 due to on-going symptoms of post-concussion syndrome.[5] Shortly thereafter, Matheny became a baseball mentor for Protégé Sports and filming some catching tips and drills for the Scottsdale-based company.
In his thirteen-year major league career, Matheny played in 1,305 games, accumulating 925 hits in 3,877 at bats for a .239 career batting average along with 67 home runs, 443 RBIs and an on-base percentage of .293.[1] He led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was 4 points above the league average during his playing career.[1] His .994 career fielding percentage ranks tenth all-time among Major League catchers.[22] Matheny also twice led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing.[1]
Managerial career (2012–present)[edit]




Matheny as manager of the Cardinals.


On January 24, 2008, Matheny returned to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following Tony La Russa's retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues.[23] The move was seen as unexpected as Matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor. Moreover, he was taking over a team that had just won the World Series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history. Matheny's other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues.[24] In spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors, Matheny guided the Cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and NLCS appearance in each of his first three seasons, becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this.[25]
First season as manager (2012)[edit]
On April 4, 2012, Matheny won in his managerial debut against the Miami Marlins in the first game of their new ballpark.[26] Twenty days later, Matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safe/out call by umpire Bill Welke in the bottom of the 10th inning of a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs.[27]
In another contest against the Marlins later that season, a bungled double switch left Matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings. Incidentally, that pitcher catalyzed a St. Louis victory in his role as a batter. With the score tied 6–6 in the bottom of the ninth inning at Marlins Park on June 25, Matheny presented the action to home plate umpire Bob Davidson to place relief pitcher Víctor Marte in the game for fellow pitcher Sam Freeman. Simultaneously, infielder Tyler Greene substituted for third baseman David Freese, originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup. Matheny assigned Greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which Freeman previously occupied – and play second base. The second baseman already in the game, Daniel Descalso, shifted to third base. Matheny showed Davidson these actions on the lineup card, and, with Davidson looking on, wrote "5" (used to designate the position of the third baseman) next to Descalso's name.
When Davidson conveyed the changes to Marlins manager Ozzie Guillén, a communication error transpired. After Marte faced one batter, Guillén vaulted from the Marlins dugout to argue that Marte and first baseman Allen Craig, the number five hitter, "couldn't be on the field at the same time." Despite his effort to oppose Guillén's protest, Davidson ruled for Matheny to remove Craig. He substituted Tony Cruz at first base, erasing two of the Cardinals' top hitters, Craig and Freese, from the game.[28] In the top of the tenth, Marte was due in Craig's fifth spot. With no regular batters remaining, Matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for Marte, rookie pitcher Joe Kelly. The Cardinals had gained the lead, 7–6, at this point and Kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs. He beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and RBI – and put the Cardinals up 8–6. This run proved to be crucial insurance as Miami's Omar Infante scored on a John Buck single in the bottom of the tenth. Nevertheless, Jason Motte, Kelly's replacement, closed it out for the 8–7 win.[29][30][31]
Matheny's first season as Cardinals manager was an overall success, finishing the regular season with an 88–74 record en route to capturing the National League wild-card game and qualifying for the postseason. The Giants defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[32]
2013–present[edit]




Matheny presents lineup card.


On February 14, 2013, the Cardinals picked up Matheny's 2014 option.[33] He surpassed the success of his first season by guiding the club in 2013 a 97–65 record, the best record in the National League and his first National League Central division title. The Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–2 in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2 in the NLCS for his first NL pennant. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series in six games, as was the case in 2004. With Matheny as the regular catcher, the Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series after a regular season with the best record in the NL. However, in 2013, St. Louis lost four key players to season-ending injuries – including Chris Carpenter, Rafael Furcal, Jaime García and Jason Motte – rookies comprised half of the World Series pitching staff.[34] On November 20, 2013, the Cardinals extended his contract for three more years through 2017.[35]
Making his first All-Star appearance as a major leaguer, Matheny was the National League manager in the 2014 game, which the American League won, 5–3.[36] The Cardinals won the NL Central division title in 2014, their second consecutive title, and third consecutive playoff appearance with Matheny as manager.[25] More trends continued as they eliminated the Dodgers from the playoffs for the second consecutive season, this time in the NLDS. As was the ending in 2012, the Giants eliminated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[37]
Tragedy struck to open the 2014–15 off-season when rookie right fielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic on October 26, 2014. Just 10 days after the completion of the NLCS,[38][39] news outlets reported the incident moments before the first pitch of Game 5 of the World Series.[40] It was the second death of an active Cardinals player during Mantheny's Cardinals career, following Kile's death in 2002. Reports confirmed alcohol intoxication on Taveras' part.[41] General manager John Mozeliak lamented the circumstances, amplifying that the team would take a greater role in instructing young players "to avoid reckless actions."[42]
After defeating the Chicago Cubs 10–9 on May 4, 2015, the Cardinals sported an MLB-best 19–6 record, which was the best 25-game start for the club since at least 1900.[43] Having won seven in a row, it established a career high for Matheny.[44] The Cardinals defeated the Cubs again the next game, 7–4, extending the win streak to eight.[45] A 3–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on May 17, 2015, securing the 300th win of his managerial career.[46] In August 2015, Baseball America published that fellow managers and coaches in the National League rated Matheny the second-best manager in the league.[47] On September 19, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to advance to the playoffs. Matheny became the first manager in MLB history to guide his club to the postseason in each of his first four full seasons.[48][49] With an 11–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, the Cardinals won 100 games for the first time in Matheny's managerial career, while clinching their third consecutive NL Central division title. The Pirates, who had kept close for most of the season, had already won 96 games, while clinching a wild-card berth.[50][51] However, the Cubs, the second wild card entrant, defeated the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games.[52] Matheny finished second in the NL Manager of the Year Award voting,[53] and a co-winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award.[54]
On May 27, 2016, Matheny gained his 400th career win in a 6–2 defeat of the Washington Nationals. In 2016 Matheny's contract was extended to 2022.[55]

Leadership and skills profile[edit]
Because the Cardinals had hired Matheny as manager following the 2011 season, questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one, particularly because he succeeded a World Series-winning manager of 33 years in La Russa. Matheny had never been a full-time coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball. However, he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days, as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader. He became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players' flaws, especially with the media. Fans and media have questioned his tactical skills, but, due to his experience playing a position (catcher) that imputes the requirement for leadership, it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure.[57]
However, with the success of his first two seasons, it became apparent Matheny was a good choice to manage the Cardinals. Said former Cardinal and veteran Lance Berkman, "People make a big deal out of not having coached or managed. ... You can take a guy with no people skills, no leadership ability, let him manage in the minor leagues for 20 years, and he'll never be ready to manage at the major league level. And you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles, put him in the big leagues, and he can be a Hall of Fame manager."[58]
Matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership, one central tenet of which is to be accessible, and to enable one's subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them.[57] In one of his blogs, Matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve.[59] Well before becoming manager, Matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics. Matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players.[57]
The Cardinals' hiring of Matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience, but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the Detroit Tigers' hiring of Brad Ausmus for their managerial position late in 2013. Similarly, Ausmus replaced a legendary manager in Jim Leyland.[60][61][62][63]

Personal life[edit]
Matheny is married to his wife, Kristen.[6] Kristen Matheny is a former field hockey player at Michigan. The couple have five children: one daughter, Katie, and four sons, Michael "Tate", Luke, Jacob and Blaise. Tate played college baseball at Missouri State University and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the 2015 MLB Draft.[65][66] Daughter Katie plays hockey at Ohio State.[67] Son Luke pitches at Oklahoma State University.[68] Matheny majored in sports management and communications with an emphasis in Spanish.[69]
Matheny routinely chronicles his life experiences and maintains a blog of which topics includes leadership and changing the culture of youth sports.[57][70] He is a Christian, and has spoken about his faith, saying, "... Jesus Christ is at the center of my life. [My faith is] all that I am, every day, every decision that I make."[71] He has been known to add a verse from the Bible to his autographs. Under his name, he includes either "John 3:16" or "John 3:17."[72]
Charity work[edit]
Matheny organized and created the Catch-22 charity (named for his playing position and uniform number) which donated tickets for Cardinals games between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Matheny opened a "Catch 22" field at the Chesterfield Valley Athletic complex in Chesterfield, Missouri.[2] The field has a completely flat and firm rubber surface and other features to allow children with a wide array of physical and mental handicaps to participate. [2][73]
Real estate ventures[edit]
The aftermath of unprofitable real estate transactions left Matheny heavily in debt. In 2005, Matheny had founded MPD Partnership with two indoor soccer players, Daryl Doran and Brett Phillips. This venture proved successful as they purchased a block of the WingHaven Develop in St. Charles and gained a $2.4 million profit after six months. Doran separated from the partnership to start a gym. Matheny and Phillips then used the income to secure an $11.8 million loan for an eleven-acre tract near Interstate 64.[74] He lost a 17-room house in Wildwood, Missouri, following insolvency on two commercial plots in near Chesterfield Valley. These plots did not sustain tenants and the value deflated after the financial crisis of 2007–08. His debts exceed $4 million and the amount of liability depended on the outcome of lawsuits involving the defaulted loans.[75] Matheny's attorney, Robert Blitz, is handling a similar case: Fischer and Frichtel, a homebuilder who also defaulted on assets after sustaining losses over the same time period, contends that they should not be fully liable for what is termed as "deflationary debt." The St. Louis appellate court deferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri.[76] In January 2013, a circuit court ruling determined that the Matheny partnership owed The Business Bank of St. Louis $4.4 million despite economic conditions and the bank's decision to stop loaning money to Matheny.[74]

Career highlights and awards




4× Gold Glove Award (2000, 2003–2005)








Matheny playing for the San Francisco Giants in 2006.


Michael Scott Matheny (born September 22, 1970) is an American former professional baseball catcher and the current manager of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), a position he has held since 2012.[1][2] A product of the University of Michigan, Matheny was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut for the Brewers in 1994 and retired in 2006 with the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Cardinals during his thirteen-year catching career.
Though not a prodigious hitter, Matheny was one of the most accomplished defensive catchers of his era, winning four Rawlings Gold Glove Awards.[3][4] Further, he established major league records among catchers for consecutive games played without committing an error (252), and consecutive chances fielded without an error (1,565). Matheny is one of only three Major League catchers with an errorless season of at least 100 games,[5] and he set a Giants single-season team record in 2005 for catcher's fielding percentage at .999. He retired from playing due to persisting concussion symptoms, and has since become an advocate for its prevention and for improved catcher safety.
After his playing career, Matheny coached Little League Baseball. The Cardinals hired him to manage following the 2011 season in spite of having no previous professional experience. In 2015, he became the first manager in MLB history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons, and, in 2014, just the fifth to a League Championship Series appearance in each of his first three. His furthest title claim occurred in 2013, when the Cardinals won the National League pennant, only to fall to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.

Early life and amateur career[edit]
Matheny grew up in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, just minutes from the city of Columbus. He graduated from Reynoldsburg High School, where he captained the baseball and football teams.[2] Receiving little attention from nearby Ohio State University, University of Michigan coach Bud Middaugh offered him a scholarship to attend Michigan.[6]
Because of his defensive and throwing skills, Matheny drew the notice of major league scouts while in high school. The Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the 31st round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft but waited two days until after the draft ended to inform Matheny they had chosen him. At first, they refused to disclose to him in which round they had selected him.[6]
Two days before he was due to attend his first class, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny's home to convince him to sign. Gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for second-round picks. During that time, teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year. The Blue Jays constantly called Matheny until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign.[6]
Confounded by the Blue Jays' overtures, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Prior to proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them that he decided to attend the University of Michigan. At Michigan, Matheny co-captained the Wolverines baseball team.[7][8] He was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team.[2]
Playing career (1991–2006)[edit]
Minor leagues, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto Blue Jays (1991–99)[edit]
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Matheny in the eighth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft and he spent three years climbing the minor league system.[9][10] He made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 7, 1994 at the age of 23; he became their starting catcher early in the next season.[1][11]
During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1998, Matheny was batting in the bottom of the ninth when he took a pitch from Rich Loiselle off his face. Remaining upright, Matheny placed his hand on his hip as Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and home plate umpire Jerry Crawford motioned wildly for the Brewers trainers. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he walked off the field.[12] At the end of that season, he became eligible for salary arbitration and the Brewers granted him free agency a few months later.[13]
Ten years after they drafted him, the Toronto Blue Jays signed on December 23, 1998, for the 1999 season. He served as Darrin Fletcher's understudy. Gillick had resigned in 1994, however. Toronto released him after the season, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 15, 1999.
St. Louis Cardinals (2000–04)[edit]
Matheny barely made the Cardinals roster after the spring training session, but went on to earn the starting catcher's role in the 2000 season.[14] He posted a career-high .261 batting average and provided exceptional defense for the Cardinals, with a .993 fielding percentage and throwing out 53% of would-be base stealers, well above the league average of 32%.[15] Matheny helped the Cardinals improve from their fourth-place finish in 1999 to capturing the National League Central Division title, and claimed his first Gold Glove award in the process.[16] After the season, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $9-million contract.[14]
After teammate Darryl Kile's sudden death in the summer of 2002, Matheny showed that he was "an inspirational leader," helping the team to cope and make it to the National League Championship Series. After the 2003 season, the St. Louis and Houston chapters of the BBWAA voted for Matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in Kile's honor.[2]
Bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher, Matheny again won Gold Gloves with the Cardinals in 2003 and 2004. His defensive contributions helped St. Louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team, including claiming the National League pennant in 2004.[3][17] Between August 1, 2002 and August 4, 2004, Matheny played in 252 games without committing an error, establishing a new Major League record for catchers.[5]
Matheny set another Major League record for catchers in 2004 by fielding 1,565 consecutive chances without an error.[5] During his playing days in a Cardinal uniform, Matheny caught 611 games, accumulating 4,938.1 innings and committing just 14 errors.[2] His .997 fielding percentage leads all catchers who have caught at least 2,000 innings for St. Louis.[18] He became a free agent after the 2004 World Series, primarily due to the emergence of rookie catcher Yadier Molina, with whom he would eventually be reunited.
San Francisco Giants (2005–06)[edit]
Matheny signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 13, 2004. The next season, he displayed a rare power surge, amassing career-highs with 13 home runs, 34 doubles, a .406 slugging percentage and 59 runs batted in (RBIs). Matheny continued his defensive excellence, compiling a team-record .999 fielding percentage and leading National League catchers with 13 double plays, 77 assists and 39 would-be base-stealers caught stealing, earning his fourth Gold Glove.[1][2] He also took home the Willie Mac Award that year, accorded annually to a San Francisco Giant for spirit and leadership.[19]
Matheny landed on the disabled list on May 31, 2006 after a series of foul balls caromed off his mask, resulting in a serious concussion.[20] In July, the Giants announced that he would not return for the remainder of the season and that his career status was in doubt. MLB.com's Giants beat writer, Rich Draper, articulated that Matheny's career was likely over due to continued struggles with post-concussion syndrome.[21]
Retirement and career statistics[edit]
On February 1, 2007, Matheny announced his retirement from Major League Baseball at the age of 35 due to on-going symptoms of post-concussion syndrome.[5] Shortly thereafter, Matheny became a baseball mentor for Protégé Sports and filming some catching tips and drills for the Scottsdale-based company.
In his thirteen-year major league career, Matheny played in 1,305 games, accumulating 925 hits in 3,877 at bats for a .239 career batting average along with 67 home runs, 443 RBIs and an on-base percentage of .293.[1] He led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was 4 points above the league average during his playing career.[1] His .994 career fielding percentage ranks tenth all-time among Major League catchers.[22] Matheny also twice led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing.[1]
Managerial career (2012–present)[edit]




Matheny as manager of the Cardinals.


On January 24, 2008, Matheny returned to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following Tony La Russa's retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues.[23] The move was seen as unexpected as Matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor. Moreover, he was taking over a team that had just won the World Series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history. Matheny's other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues.[24] In spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors, Matheny guided the Cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and NLCS appearance in each of his first three seasons, becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this.[25]
First season as manager (2012)[edit]
On April 4, 2012, Matheny won in his managerial debut against the Miami Marlins in the first game of their new ballpark.[26] Twenty days later, Matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safe/out call by umpire Bill Welke in the bottom of the 10th inning of a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs.[27]
In another contest against the Marlins later that season, a bungled double switch left Matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings. Incidentally, that pitcher catalyzed a St. Louis victory in his role as a batter. With the score tied 6–6 in the bottom of the ninth inning at Marlins Park on June 25, Matheny presented the action to home plate umpire Bob Davidson to place relief pitcher Víctor Marte in the game for fellow pitcher Sam Freeman. Simultaneously, infielder Tyler Greene substituted for third baseman David Freese, originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup. Matheny assigned Greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which Freeman previously occupied – and play second base. The second baseman already in the game, Daniel Descalso, shifted to third base. Matheny showed Davidson these actions on the lineup card, and, with Davidson looking on, wrote "5" (used to designate the position of the third baseman) next to Descalso's name.
When Davidson conveyed the changes to Marlins manager Ozzie Guillén, a communication error transpired. After Marte faced one batter, Guillén vaulted from the Marlins dugout to argue that Marte and first baseman Allen Craig, the number five hitter, "couldn't be on the field at the same time." Despite his effort to oppose Guillén's protest, Davidson ruled for Matheny to remove Craig. He substituted Tony Cruz at first base, erasing two of the Cardinals' top hitters, Craig and Freese, from the game.[28] In the top of the tenth, Marte was due in Craig's fifth spot. With no regular batters remaining, Matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for Marte, rookie pitcher Joe Kelly. The Cardinals had gained the lead, 7–6, at this point and Kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs. He beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and RBI – and put the Cardinals up 8–6. This run proved to be crucial insurance as Miami's Omar Infante scored on a John Buck single in the bottom of the tenth. Nevertheless, Jason Motte, Kelly's replacement, closed it out for the 8–7 win.[29][30][31]
Matheny's first season as Cardinals manager was an overall success, finishing the regular season with an 88–74 record en route to capturing the National League wild-card game and qualifying for the postseason. The Giants defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[32]
2013–present[edit]




Matheny presents lineup card.


On February 14, 2013, the Cardinals picked up Matheny's 2014 option.[33] He surpassed the success of his first season by guiding the club in 2013 a 97–65 record, the best record in the National League and his first National League Central division title. The Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–2 in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2 in the NLCS for his first NL pennant. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series in six games, as was the case in 2004. With Matheny as the regular catcher, the Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series after a regular season with the best record in the NL. However, in 2013, St. Louis lost four key players to season-ending injuries – including Chris Carpenter, Rafael Furcal, Jaime García and Jason Motte – rookies comprised half of the World Series pitching staff.[34] On November 20, 2013, the Cardinals extended his contract for three more years through 2017.[35]
Making his first All-Star appearance as a major leaguer, Matheny was the National League manager in the 2014 game, which the American League won, 5–3.[36] The Cardinals won the NL Central division title in 2014, their second consecutive title, and third consecutive playoff appearance with Matheny as manager.[25] More trends continued as they eliminated the Dodgers from the playoffs for the second consecutive season, this time in the NLDS. As was the ending in 2012, the Giants eliminated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[37]
Tragedy struck to open the 2014–15 off-season when rookie right fielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic on October 26, 2014. Just 10 days after the completion of the NLCS,[38][39] news outlets reported the incident moments before the first pitch of Game 5 of the World Series.[40] It was the second death of an active Cardinals player during Mantheny's Cardinals career, following Kile's death in 2002. Reports confirmed alcohol intoxication on Taveras' part.[41] General manager John Mozeliak lamented the circumstances, amplifying that the team would take a greater role in instructing young players "to avoid reckless actions."[42]
After defeating the Chicago Cubs 10–9 on May 4, 2015, the Cardinals sported an MLB-best 19–6 record, which was the best 25-game start for the club since at least 1900.[43] Having won seven in a row, it established a career high for Matheny.[44] The Cardinals defeated the Cubs again the next game, 7–4, extending the win streak to eight.[45] A 3–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on May 17, 2015, securing the 300th win of his managerial career.[46] In August 2015, Baseball America published that fellow managers and coaches in the National League rated Matheny the second-best manager in the league.[47] On September 19, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to advance to the playoffs. Matheny became the first manager in MLB history to guide his club to the postseason in each of his first four full seasons.[48][49] With an 11–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, the Cardinals won 100 games for the first time in Matheny's managerial career, while clinching their third consecutive NL Central division title. The Pirates, who had kept close for most of the season, had already won 96 games, while clinching a wild-card berth.[50][51] However, the Cubs, the second wild card entrant, defeated the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games.[52] Matheny finished second in the NL Manager of the Year Award voting,[53] and a co-winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award.[54]
On May 27, 2016, Matheny gained his 400th career win in a 6–2 defeat of the Washington Nationals. In 2016 Matheny's contract was extended to 2022.[55]

Leadership and skills profile[edit]
Because the Cardinals had hired Matheny as manager following the 2011 season, questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one, particularly because he succeeded a World Series-winning manager of 33 years in La Russa. Matheny had never been a full-time coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball. However, he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days, as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader. He became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players' flaws, especially with the media. Fans and media have questioned his tactical skills, but, due to his experience playing a position (catcher) that imputes the requirement for leadership, it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure.[57]
However, with the success of his first two seasons, it became apparent Matheny was a good choice to manage the Cardinals. Said former Cardinal and veteran Lance Berkman, "People make a big deal out of not having coached or managed. ... You can take a guy with no people skills, no leadership ability, let him manage in the minor leagues for 20 years, and he'll never be ready to manage at the major league level. And you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles, put him in the big leagues, and he can be a Hall of Fame manager."[58]
Matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership, one central tenet of which is to be accessible, and to enable one's subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them.[57] In one of his blogs, Matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve.[59] Well before becoming manager, Matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics. Matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players.[57]
The Cardinals' hiring of Matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience, but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the Detroit Tigers' hiring of Brad Ausmus for their managerial position late in 2013. Similarly, Ausmus replaced a legendary manager in Jim Leyland.[60][61][62][63]

Personal life[edit]
Matheny is married to his wife, Kristen.[6] Kristen Matheny is a former field hockey player at Michigan. The couple have five children: one daughter, Katie, and four sons, Michael "Tate", Luke, Jacob and Blaise. Tate played college baseball at Missouri State University and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the 2015 MLB Draft.[65][66] Daughter Katie plays hockey at Ohio State.[67] Son Luke pitches at Oklahoma State University.[68] Matheny majored in sports management and communications with an emphasis in Spanish.[69]
Matheny routinely chronicles his life experiences and maintains a blog of which topics includes leadership and changing the culture of youth sports.[57][70] He is a Christian, and has spoken about his faith, saying, "... Jesus Christ is at the center of my life. [My faith is] all that I am, every day, every decision that I make."[71] He has been known to add a verse from the Bible to his autographs. Under his name, he includes either "John 3:16" or "John 3:17."[72]
Charity work[edit]
Matheny organized and created the Catch-22 charity (named for his playing position and uniform number) which donated tickets for Cardinals games between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Matheny opened a "Catch 22" field at the Chesterfield Valley Athletic complex in Chesterfield, Missouri.[2] The field has a completely flat and firm rubber surface and other features to allow children with a wide array of physical and mental handicaps to participate. [2][73]
Real estate ventures[edit]
The aftermath of unprofitable real estate transactions left Matheny heavily in debt. In 2005, Matheny had founded MPD Partnership with two indoor soccer players, Daryl Doran and Brett Phillips. This venture proved successful as they purchased a block of the WingHaven Develop in St. Charles and gained a $2.4 million profit after six months. Doran separated from the partnership to start a gym. Matheny and Phillips then used the income to secure an $11.8 million loan for an eleven-acre tract near Interstate 64.[74] He lost a 17-room house in Wildwood, Missouri, following insolvency on two commercial plots in near Chesterfield Valley. These plots did not sustain tenants and the value deflated after the financial crisis of 2007–08. His debts exceed $4 million and the amount of liability depended on the outcome of lawsuits involving the defaulted loans.[75] Matheny's attorney, Robert Blitz, is handling a similar case: Fischer and Frichtel, a homebuilder who also defaulted on assets after sustaining losses over the same time period, contends that they should not be fully liable for what is termed as "deflationary debt." The St. Louis appellate court deferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri.[76] In January 2013, a circuit court ruling determined that the Matheny partnership owed The Business Bank of St. Louis $4.4 million despite economic conditions and the bank's decision to stop loaning money to Matheny.[74]

4× Gold Glove Award (2000, 2003–2005)








Matheny playing for the San Francisco Giants in 2006.


Michael Scott Matheny (born September 22, 1970) is an American former professional baseball catcher and the current manager of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), a position he has held since 2012.[1][2] A product of the University of Michigan, Matheny was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut for the Brewers in 1994 and retired in 2006 with the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Cardinals during his thirteen-year catching career.
Though not a prodigious hitter, Matheny was one of the most accomplished defensive catchers of his era, winning four Rawlings Gold Glove Awards.[3][4] Further, he established major league records among catchers for consecutive games played without committing an error (252), and consecutive chances fielded without an error (1,565). Matheny is one of only three Major League catchers with an errorless season of at least 100 games,[5] and he set a Giants single-season team record in 2005 for catcher's fielding percentage at .999. He retired from playing due to persisting concussion symptoms, and has since become an advocate for its prevention and for improved catcher safety.
After his playing career, Matheny coached Little League Baseball. The Cardinals hired him to manage following the 2011 season in spite of having no previous professional experience. In 2015, he became the first manager in MLB history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons, and, in 2014, just the fifth to a League Championship Series appearance in each of his first three. His furthest title claim occurred in 2013, when the Cardinals won the National League pennant, only to fall to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.

Early life and amateur career[edit]
Matheny grew up in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, just minutes from the city of Columbus. He graduated from Reynoldsburg High School, where he captained the baseball and football teams.[2] Receiving little attention from nearby Ohio State University, University of Michigan coach Bud Middaugh offered him a scholarship to attend Michigan.[6]
Because of his defensive and throwing skills, Matheny drew the notice of major league scouts while in high school. The Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the 31st round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft but waited two days until after the draft ended to inform Matheny they had chosen him. At first, they refused to disclose to him in which round they had selected him.[6]
Two days before he was due to attend his first class, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny's home to convince him to sign. Gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for second-round picks. During that time, teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year. The Blue Jays constantly called Matheny until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign.[6]
Confounded by the Blue Jays' overtures, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Prior to proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them that he decided to attend the University of Michigan. At Michigan, Matheny co-captained the Wolverines baseball team.[7][8] He was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team.[2]
Playing career (1991–2006)[edit]
Minor leagues, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto Blue Jays (1991–99)[edit]
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Matheny in the eighth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft and he spent three years climbing the minor league system.[9][10] He made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 7, 1994 at the age of 23; he became their starting catcher early in the next season.[1][11]
During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1998, Matheny was batting in the bottom of the ninth when he took a pitch from Rich Loiselle off his face. Remaining upright, Matheny placed his hand on his hip as Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and home plate umpire Jerry Crawford motioned wildly for the Brewers trainers. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he walked off the field.[12] At the end of that season, he became eligible for salary arbitration and the Brewers granted him free agency a few months later.[13]
Ten years after they drafted him, the Toronto Blue Jays signed on December 23, 1998, for the 1999 season. He served as Darrin Fletcher's understudy. Gillick had resigned in 1994, however. Toronto released him after the season, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 15, 1999.
St. Louis Cardinals (2000–04)[edit]
Matheny barely made the Cardinals roster after the spring training session, but went on to earn the starting catcher's role in the 2000 season.[14] He posted a career-high .261 batting average and provided exceptional defense for the Cardinals, with a .993 fielding percentage and throwing out 53% of would-be base stealers, well above the league average of 32%.[15] Matheny helped the Cardinals improve from their fourth-place finish in 1999 to capturing the National League Central Division title, and claimed his first Gold Glove award in the process.[16] After the season, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $9-million contract.[14]
After teammate Darryl Kile's sudden death in the summer of 2002, Matheny showed that he was "an inspirational leader," helping the team to cope and make it to the National League Championship Series. After the 2003 season, the St. Louis and Houston chapters of the BBWAA voted for Matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in Kile's honor.[2]
Bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher, Matheny again won Gold Gloves with the Cardinals in 2003 and 2004. His defensive contributions helped St. Louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team, including claiming the National League pennant in 2004.[3][17] Between August 1, 2002 and August 4, 2004, Matheny played in 252 games without committing an error, establishing a new Major League record for catchers.[5]
Matheny set another Major League record for catchers in 2004 by fielding 1,565 consecutive chances without an error.[5] During his playing days in a Cardinal uniform, Matheny caught 611 games, accumulating 4,938.1 innings and committing just 14 errors.[2] His .997 fielding percentage leads all catchers who have caught at least 2,000 innings for St. Louis.[18] He became a free agent after the 2004 World Series, primarily due to the emergence of rookie catcher Yadier Molina, with whom he would eventually be reunited.
San Francisco Giants (2005–06)[edit]
Matheny signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 13, 2004. The next season, he displayed a rare power surge, amassing career-highs with 13 home runs, 34 doubles, a .406 slugging percentage and 59 runs batted in (RBIs). Matheny continued his defensive excellence, compiling a team-record .999 fielding percentage and leading National League catchers with 13 double plays, 77 assists and 39 would-be base-stealers caught stealing, earning his fourth Gold Glove.[1][2] He also took home the Willie Mac Award that year, accorded annually to a San Francisco Giant for spirit and leadership.[19]
Matheny landed on the disabled list on May 31, 2006 after a series of foul balls caromed off his mask, resulting in a serious concussion.[20] In July, the Giants announced that he would not return for the remainder of the season and that his career status was in doubt. MLB.com's Giants beat writer, Rich Draper, articulated that Matheny's career was likely over due to continued struggles with post-concussion syndrome.[21]
Retirement and career statistics[edit]
On February 1, 2007, Matheny announced his retirement from Major League Baseball at the age of 35 due to on-going symptoms of post-concussion syndrome.[5] Shortly thereafter, Matheny became a baseball mentor for Protégé Sports and filming some catching tips and drills for the Scottsdale-based company.
In his thirteen-year major league career, Matheny played in 1,305 games, accumulating 925 hits in 3,877 at bats for a .239 career batting average along with 67 home runs, 443 RBIs and an on-base percentage of .293.[1] He led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was 4 points above the league average during his playing career.[1] His .994 career fielding percentage ranks tenth all-time among Major League catchers.[22] Matheny also twice led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing.[1]
Managerial career (2012–present)[edit]




Matheny as manager of the Cardinals.


On January 24, 2008, Matheny returned to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following Tony La Russa's retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues.[23] The move was seen as unexpected as Matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor. Moreover, he was taking over a team that had just won the World Series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history. Matheny's other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues.[24] In spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors, Matheny guided the Cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and NLCS appearance in each of his first three seasons, becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this.[25]
First season as manager (2012)[edit]
On April 4, 2012, Matheny won in his managerial debut against the Miami Marlins in the first game of their new ballpark.[26] Twenty days later, Matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safe/out call by umpire Bill Welke in the bottom of the 10th inning of a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs.[27]
In another contest against the Marlins later that season, a bungled double switch left Matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings. Incidentally, that pitcher catalyzed a St. Louis victory in his role as a batter. With the score tied 6–6 in the bottom of the ninth inning at Marlins Park on June 25, Matheny presented the action to home plate umpire Bob Davidson to place relief pitcher Víctor Marte in the game for fellow pitcher Sam Freeman. Simultaneously, infielder Tyler Greene substituted for third baseman David Freese, originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup. Matheny assigned Greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which Freeman previously occupied – and play second base. The second baseman already in the game, Daniel Descalso, shifted to third base. Matheny showed Davidson these actions on the lineup card, and, with Davidson looking on, wrote "5" (used to designate the position of the third baseman) next to Descalso's name.
When Davidson conveyed the changes to Marlins manager Ozzie Guillén, a communication error transpired. After Marte faced one batter, Guillén vaulted from the Marlins dugout to argue that Marte and first baseman Allen Craig, the number five hitter, "couldn't be on the field at the same time." Despite his effort to oppose Guillén's protest, Davidson ruled for Matheny to remove Craig. He substituted Tony Cruz at first base, erasing two of the Cardinals' top hitters, Craig and Freese, from the game.[28] In the top of the tenth, Marte was due in Craig's fifth spot. With no regular batters remaining, Matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for Marte, rookie pitcher Joe Kelly. The Cardinals had gained the lead, 7–6, at this point and Kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs. He beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and RBI – and put the Cardinals up 8–6. This run proved to be crucial insurance as Miami's Omar Infante scored on a John Buck single in the bottom of the tenth. Nevertheless, Jason Motte, Kelly's replacement, closed it out for the 8–7 win.[29][30][31]
Matheny's first season as Cardinals manager was an overall success, finishing the regular season with an 88–74 record en route to capturing the National League wild-card game and qualifying for the postseason. The Giants defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[32]
2013–present[edit]




Matheny presents lineup card.


On February 14, 2013, the Cardinals picked up Matheny's 2014 option.[33] He surpassed the success of his first season by guiding the club in 2013 a 97–65 record, the best record in the National League and his first National League Central division title. The Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–2 in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2 in the NLCS for his first NL pennant. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series in six games, as was the case in 2004. With Matheny as the regular catcher, the Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series after a regular season with the best record in the NL. However, in 2013, St. Louis lost four key players to season-ending injuries – including Chris Carpenter, Rafael Furcal, Jaime García and Jason Motte – rookies comprised half of the World Series pitching staff.[34] On November 20, 2013, the Cardinals extended his contract for three more years through 2017.[35]
Making his first All-Star appearance as a major leaguer, Matheny was the National League manager in the 2014 game, which the American League won, 5–3.[36] The Cardinals won the NL Central division title in 2014, their second consecutive title, and third consecutive playoff appearance with Matheny as manager.[25] More trends continued as they eliminated the Dodgers from the playoffs for the second consecutive season, this time in the NLDS. As was the ending in 2012, the Giants eliminated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[37]
Tragedy struck to open the 2014–15 off-season when rookie right fielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic on October 26, 2014. Just 10 days after the completion of the NLCS,[38][39] news outlets reported the incident moments before the first pitch of Game 5 of the World Series.[40] It was the second death of an active Cardinals player during Mantheny's Cardinals career, following Kile's death in 2002. Reports confirmed alcohol intoxication on Taveras' part.[41] General manager John Mozeliak lamented the circumstances, amplifying that the team would take a greater role in instructing young players "to avoid reckless actions."[42]
After defeating the Chicago Cubs 10–9 on May 4, 2015, the Cardinals sported an MLB-best 19–6 record, which was the best 25-game start for the club since at least 1900.[43] Having won seven in a row, it established a career high for Matheny.[44] The Cardinals defeated the Cubs again the next game, 7–4, extending the win streak to eight.[45] A 3–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on May 17, 2015, securing the 300th win of his managerial career.[46] In August 2015, Baseball America published that fellow managers and coaches in the National League rated Matheny the second-best manager in the league.[47] On September 19, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to advance to the playoffs. Matheny became the first manager in MLB history to guide his club to the postseason in each of his first four full seasons.[48][49] With an 11–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, the Cardinals won 100 games for the first time in Matheny's managerial career, while clinching their third consecutive NL Central division title. The Pirates, who had kept close for most of the season, had already won 96 games, while clinching a wild-card berth.[50][51] However, the Cubs, the second wild card entrant, defeated the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games.[52] Matheny finished second in the NL Manager of the Year Award voting,[53] and a co-winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award.[54]
On May 27, 2016, Matheny gained his 400th career win in a 6–2 defeat of the Washington Nationals. In 2016 Matheny's contract was extended to 2022.[55]

Leadership and skills profile[edit]
Because the Cardinals had hired Matheny as manager following the 2011 season, questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one, particularly because he succeeded a World Series-winning manager of 33 years in La Russa. Matheny had never been a full-time coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball. However, he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days, as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader. He became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players' flaws, especially with the media. Fans and media have questioned his tactical skills, but, due to his experience playing a position (catcher) that imputes the requirement for leadership, it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure.[57]
However, with the success of his first two seasons, it became apparent Matheny was a good choice to manage the Cardinals. Said former Cardinal and veteran Lance Berkman, "People make a big deal out of not having coached or managed. ... You can take a guy with no people skills, no leadership ability, let him manage in the minor leagues for 20 years, and he'll never be ready to manage at the major league level. And you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles, put him in the big leagues, and he can be a Hall of Fame manager."[58]
Matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership, one central tenet of which is to be accessible, and to enable one's subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them.[57] In one of his blogs, Matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve.[59] Well before becoming manager, Matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics. Matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players.[57]
The Cardinals' hiring of Matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience, but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the Detroit Tigers' hiring of Brad Ausmus for their managerial position late in 2013. Similarly, Ausmus replaced a legendary manager in Jim Leyland.[60][61][62][63]

Personal life[edit]
Matheny is married to his wife, Kristen.[6] Kristen Matheny is a former field hockey player at Michigan. The couple have five children: one daughter, Katie, and four sons, Michael "Tate", Luke, Jacob and Blaise. Tate played college baseball at Missouri State University and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the 2015 MLB Draft.[65][66] Daughter Katie plays hockey at Ohio State.[67] Son Luke pitches at Oklahoma State University.[68] Matheny majored in sports management and communications with an emphasis in Spanish.[69]
Matheny routinely chronicles his life experiences and maintains a blog of which topics includes leadership and changing the culture of youth sports.[57][70] He is a Christian, and has spoken about his faith, saying, "... Jesus Christ is at the center of my life. [My faith is] all that I am, every day, every decision that I make."[71] He has been known to add a verse from the Bible to his autographs. Under his name, he includes either "John 3:16" or "John 3:17."[72]
Charity work[edit]
Matheny organized and created the Catch-22 charity (named for his playing position and uniform number) which donated tickets for Cardinals games between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Matheny opened a "Catch 22" field at the Chesterfield Valley Athletic complex in Chesterfield, Missouri.[2] The field has a completely flat and firm rubber surface and other features to allow children with a wide array of physical and mental handicaps to participate. [2][73]
Real estate ventures[edit]
The aftermath of unprofitable real estate transactions left Matheny heavily in debt. In 2005, Matheny had founded MPD Partnership with two indoor soccer players, Daryl Doran and Brett Phillips. This venture proved successful as they purchased a block of the WingHaven Develop in St. Charles and gained a $2.4 million profit after six months. Doran separated from the partnership to start a gym. Matheny and Phillips then used the income to secure an $11.8 million loan for an eleven-acre tract near Interstate 64.[74] He lost a 17-room house in Wildwood, Missouri, following insolvency on two commercial plots in near Chesterfield Valley. These plots did not sustain tenants and the value deflated after the financial crisis of 2007–08. His debts exceed $4 million and the amount of liability depended on the outcome of lawsuits involving the defaulted loans.[75] Matheny's attorney, Robert Blitz, is handling a similar case: Fischer and Frichtel, a homebuilder who also defaulted on assets after sustaining losses over the same time period, contends that they should not be fully liable for what is termed as "deflationary debt." The St. Louis appellate court deferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri.[76] In January 2013, a circuit court ruling determined that the Matheny partnership owed The Business Bank of St. Louis $4.4 million despite economic conditions and the bank's decision to stop loaning money to Matheny.[74]

Career highlights and awards




4× Gold Glove Award (2000, 2003–2005)








Matheny playing for the San Francisco Giants in 2006.


Michael Scott Matheny (born September 22, 1970) is an American former professional baseball catcher and the current manager of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), a position he has held since 2012.[1][2] A product of the University of Michigan, Matheny was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut for the Brewers in 1994 and retired in 2006 with the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Cardinals during his thirteen-year catching career.
Though not a prodigious hitter, Matheny was one of the most accomplished defensive catchers of his era, winning four Rawlings Gold Glove Awards.[3][4] Further, he established major league records among catchers for consecutive games played without committing an error (252), and consecutive chances fielded without an error (1,565). Matheny is one of only three Major League catchers with an errorless season of at least 100 games,[5] and he set a Giants single-season team record in 2005 for catcher's fielding percentage at .999. He retired from playing due to persisting concussion symptoms, and has since become an advocate for its prevention and for improved catcher safety.
After his playing career, Matheny coached Little League Baseball. The Cardinals hired him to manage following the 2011 season in spite of having no previous professional experience. In 2015, he became the first manager in MLB history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons, and, in 2014, just the fifth to a League Championship Series appearance in each of his first three. His furthest title claim occurred in 2013, when the Cardinals won the National League pennant, only to fall to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.

Early life and amateur career[edit]
Matheny grew up in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, just minutes from the city of Columbus. He graduated from Reynoldsburg High School, where he captained the baseball and football teams.[2] Receiving little attention from nearby Ohio State University, University of Michigan coach Bud Middaugh offered him a scholarship to attend Michigan.[6]
Because of his defensive and throwing skills, Matheny drew the notice of major league scouts while in high school. The Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the 31st round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft but waited two days until after the draft ended to inform Matheny they had chosen him. At first, they refused to disclose to him in which round they had selected him.[6]
Two days before he was due to attend his first class, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny's home to convince him to sign. Gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for second-round picks. During that time, teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year. The Blue Jays constantly called Matheny until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign.[6]
Confounded by the Blue Jays' overtures, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Prior to proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them that he decided to attend the University of Michigan. At Michigan, Matheny co-captained the Wolverines baseball team.[7][8] He was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team.[2]
Playing career (1991–2006)[edit]
Minor leagues, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto Blue Jays (1991–99)[edit]
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Matheny in the eighth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft and he spent three years climbing the minor league system.[9][10] He made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 7, 1994 at the age of 23; he became their starting catcher early in the next season.[1][11]
During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1998, Matheny was batting in the bottom of the ninth when he took a pitch from Rich Loiselle off his face. Remaining upright, Matheny placed his hand on his hip as Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and home plate umpire Jerry Crawford motioned wildly for the Brewers trainers. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he walked off the field.[12] At the end of that season, he became eligible for salary arbitration and the Brewers granted him free agency a few months later.[13]
Ten years after they drafted him, the Toronto Blue Jays signed on December 23, 1998, for the 1999 season. He served as Darrin Fletcher's understudy. Gillick had resigned in 1994, however. Toronto released him after the season, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 15, 1999.
St. Louis Cardinals (2000–04)[edit]
Matheny barely made the Cardinals roster after the spring training session, but went on to earn the starting catcher's role in the 2000 season.[14] He posted a career-high .261 batting average and provided exceptional defense for the Cardinals, with a .993 fielding percentage and throwing out 53% of would-be base stealers, well above the league average of 32%.[15] Matheny helped the Cardinals improve from their fourth-place finish in 1999 to capturing the National League Central Division title, and claimed his first Gold Glove award in the process.[16] After the season, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $9-million contract.[14]
After teammate Darryl Kile's sudden death in the summer of 2002, Matheny showed that he was "an inspirational leader," helping the team to cope and make it to the National League Championship Series. After the 2003 season, the St. Louis and Houston chapters of the BBWAA voted for Matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in Kile's honor.[2]
Bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher, Matheny again won Gold Gloves with the Cardinals in 2003 and 2004. His defensive contributions helped St. Louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team, including claiming the National League pennant in 2004.[3][17] Between August 1, 2002 and August 4, 2004, Matheny played in 252 games without committing an error, establishing a new Major League record for catchers.[5]
Matheny set another Major League record for catchers in 2004 by fielding 1,565 consecutive chances without an error.[5] During his playing days in a Cardinal uniform, Matheny caught 611 games, accumulating 4,938.1 innings and committing just 14 errors.[2] His .997 fielding percentage leads all catchers who have caught at least 2,000 innings for St. Louis.[18] He became a free agent after the 2004 World Series, primarily due to the emergence of rookie catcher Yadier Molina, with whom he would eventually be reunited.
San Francisco Giants (2005–06)[edit]
Matheny signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 13, 2004. The next season, he displayed a rare power surge, amassing career-highs with 13 home runs, 34 doubles, a .406 slugging percentage and 59 runs batted in (RBIs). Matheny continued his defensive excellence, compiling a team-record .999 fielding percentage and leading National League catchers with 13 double plays, 77 assists and 39 would-be base-stealers caught stealing, earning his fourth Gold Glove.[1][2] He also took home the Willie Mac Award that year, accorded annually to a San Francisco Giant for spirit and leadership.[19]
Matheny landed on the disabled list on May 31, 2006 after a series of foul balls caromed off his mask, resulting in a serious concussion.[20] In July, the Giants announced that he would not return for the remainder of the season and that his career status was in doubt. MLB.com's Giants beat writer, Rich Draper, articulated that Matheny's career was likely over due to continued struggles with post-concussion syndrome.[21]
Retirement and career statistics[edit]
On February 1, 2007, Matheny announced his retirement from Major League Baseball at the age of 35 due to on-going symptoms of post-concussion syndrome.[5] Shortly thereafter, Matheny became a baseball mentor for Protégé Sports and filming some catching tips and drills for the Scottsdale-based company.
In his thirteen-year major league career, Matheny played in 1,305 games, accumulating 925 hits in 3,877 at bats for a .239 career batting average along with 67 home runs, 443 RBIs and an on-base percentage of .293.[1] He led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was 4 points above the league average during his playing career.[1] His .994 career fielding percentage ranks tenth all-time among Major League catchers.[22] Matheny also twice led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing.[1]
Managerial career (2012–present)[edit]




Matheny as manager of the Cardinals.


On January 24, 2008, Matheny returned to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following Tony La Russa's retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues.[23] The move was seen as unexpected as Matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor. Moreover, he was taking over a team that had just won the World Series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history. Matheny's other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues.[24] In spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors, Matheny guided the Cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and NLCS appearance in each of his first three seasons, becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this.[25]
First season as manager (2012)[edit]
On April 4, 2012, Matheny won in his managerial debut against the Miami Marlins in the first game of their new ballpark.[26] Twenty days later, Matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safe/out call by umpire Bill Welke in the bottom of the 10th inning of a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs.[27]
In another contest against the Marlins later that season, a bungled double switch left Matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings. Incidentally, that pitcher catalyzed a St. Louis victory in his role as a batter. With the score tied 6–6 in the bottom of the ninth inning at Marlins Park on June 25, Matheny presented the action to home plate umpire Bob Davidson to place relief pitcher Víctor Marte in the game for fellow pitcher Sam Freeman. Simultaneously, infielder Tyler Greene substituted for third baseman David Freese, originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup. Matheny assigned Greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which Freeman previously occupied – and play second base. The second baseman already in the game, Daniel Descalso, shifted to third base. Matheny showed Davidson these actions on the lineup card, and, with Davidson looking on, wrote "5" (used to designate the position of the third baseman) next to Descalso's name.
When Davidson conveyed the changes to Marlins manager Ozzie Guillén, a communication error transpired. After Marte faced one batter, Guillén vaulted from the Marlins dugout to argue that Marte and first baseman Allen Craig, the number five hitter, "couldn't be on the field at the same time." Despite his effort to oppose Guillén's protest, Davidson ruled for Matheny to remove Craig. He substituted Tony Cruz at first base, erasing two of the Cardinals' top hitters, Craig and Freese, from the game.[28] In the top of the tenth, Marte was due in Craig's fifth spot. With no regular batters remaining, Matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for Marte, rookie pitcher Joe Kelly. The Cardinals had gained the lead, 7–6, at this point and Kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs. He beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and RBI – and put the Cardinals up 8–6. This run proved to be crucial insurance as Miami's Omar Infante scored on a John Buck single in the bottom of the tenth. Nevertheless, Jason Motte, Kelly's replacement, closed it out for the 8–7 win.[29][30][31]
Matheny's first season as Cardinals manager was an overall success, finishing the regular season with an 88–74 record en route to capturing the National League wild-card game and qualifying for the postseason. The Giants defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[32]
2013–present[edit]




Matheny presents lineup card.


On February 14, 2013, the Cardinals picked up Matheny's 2014 option.[33] He surpassed the success of his first season by guiding the club in 2013 a 97–65 record, the best record in the National League and his first National League Central division title. The Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–2 in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2 in the NLCS for his first NL pennant. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series in six games, as was the case in 2004. With Matheny as the regular catcher, the Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series after a regular season with the best record in the NL. However, in 2013, St. Louis lost four key players to season-ending injuries – including Chris Carpenter, Rafael Furcal, Jaime García and Jason Motte – rookies comprised half of the World Series pitching staff.[34] On November 20, 2013, the Cardinals extended his contract for three more years through 2017.[35]
Making his first All-Star appearance as a major leaguer, Matheny was the National League manager in the 2014 game, which the American League won, 5–3.[36] The Cardinals won the NL Central division title in 2014, their second consecutive title, and third consecutive playoff appearance with Matheny as manager.[25] More trends continued as they eliminated the Dodgers from the playoffs for the second consecutive season, this time in the NLDS. As was the ending in 2012, the Giants eliminated the Cardinals in the NLCS.[37]
Tragedy struck to open the 2014–15 off-season when rookie right fielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic on October 26, 2014. Just 10 days after the completion of the NLCS,[38][39] news outlets reported the incident moments before the first pitch of Game 5 of the World Series.[40] It was the second death of an active Cardinals player during Mantheny's Cardinals career, following Kile's death in 2002. Reports confirmed alcohol intoxication on Taveras' part.[41] General manager John Mozeliak lamented the circumstances, amplifying that the team would take a greater role in instructing young players "to avoid reckless actions."[42]
After defeating the Chicago Cubs 10–9 on May 4, 2015, the Cardinals sported an MLB-best 19–6 record, which was the best 25-game start for the club since at least 1900.[43] Having won seven in a row, it established a career high for Matheny.[44] The Cardinals defeated the Cubs again the next game, 7–4, extending the win streak to eight.[45] A 3–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on May 17, 2015, securing the 300th win of his managerial career.[46] In August 2015, Baseball America published that fellow managers and coaches in the National League rated Matheny the second-best manager in the league.[47] On September 19, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to advance to the playoffs. Matheny became the first manager in MLB history to guide his club to the postseason in each of his first four full seasons.[48][49] With an 11–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, the Cardinals won 100 games for the first time in Matheny's managerial career, while clinching their third consecutive NL Central division title. The Pirates, who had kept close for most of the season, had already won 96 games, while clinching a wild-card berth.[50][51] However, the Cubs, the second wild card entrant, defeated the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games.[52] Matheny finished second in the NL Manager of the Year Award voting,[53] and a co-winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award.[54]
On May 27, 2016, Matheny gained his 400th career win in a 6–2 defeat of the Washington Nationals. In 2016 Matheny's contract was extended to 2022.[55]

Leadership and skills profile[edit]
Because the Cardinals had hired Matheny as manager following the 2011 season, questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one, particularly because he succeeded a World Series-winning manager of 33 years in La Russa. Matheny had never been a full-time coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball. However, he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days, as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader. He became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players' flaws, especially with the media. Fans and media have questioned his tactical skills, but, due to his experience playing a position (catcher) that imputes the requirement for leadership, it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure.[57]
However, with the success of his first two seasons, it became apparent Matheny was a good choice to manage the Cardinals. Said former Cardinal and veteran Lance Berkman, "People make a big deal out of not having coached or managed. ... You can take a guy with no people skills, no leadership ability, let him manage in the minor leagues for 20 years, and he'll never be ready to manage at the major league level. And you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles, put him in the big leagues, and he can be a Hall of Fame manager."[58]
Matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership, one central tenet of which is to be accessible, and to enable one's subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them.[57] In one of his blogs, Matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve.[59] Well before becoming manager, Matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics. Matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players.[57]
The Cardinals' hiring of Matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience, but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the Detroit Tigers' hiring of Brad Ausmus for their managerial position late in 2013. Similarly, Ausmus replaced a legendary manager in Jim Leyland.[60][61][62][63]

Personal life[edit]
Matheny is married to his wife, Kristen.[6] Kristen Matheny is a former field hockey player at Michigan. The couple have five children: one daughter, Katie, and four sons, Michael "Tate", Luke, Jacob and Blaise. Tate played college baseball at Missouri State University and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the 2015 MLB Draft.[65][66] Daughter Katie plays hockey at Ohio State.[67] Son Luke pitches at Oklahoma State University.[68] Matheny majored in sports management and communications with an emphasis in Spanish.[69]
Matheny routinely chronicles his life experiences and maintains a blog of which topics includes leadership and changing the culture of youth sports.[57][70] He is a Christian, and has spoken about his faith, saying, "... Jesus Christ is at the center of my life. [My faith is] all that I am, every day, every decision that I make."[71] He has been known to add a verse from the Bible to his autographs. Under his name, he includes either "John 3:16" or "John 3:17."[72]
Charity work[edit]
Matheny organized and created the Catch-22 charity (named for his playing position and uniform number) which donated tickets for Cardinals games between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Matheny opened a "Catch 22" field at the Chesterfield Valley Athletic complex in Chesterfield, Missouri.[2] The field has a completely flat and firm rubber surface and other features to allow children with a wide array of physical and mental handicaps to participate. [2][73]
Real estate ventures[edit]
The aftermath of unprofitable real estate transactions left Matheny heavily in debt. In 2005, Matheny had founded MPD Partnership with two indoor soccer players, Daryl Doran and Brett Phillips. This venture proved successful as they purchased a block of the WingHaven Develop in St. Charles and gained a $2.4 million profit after six months. Doran separated from the partnership to start a gym. Matheny and Phillips then used the income to secure an $11.8 million loan for an eleven-acre tract near Interstate 64.[74] He lost a 17-room house in Wildwood, Missouri, following insolvency on two commercial plots in near Chesterfield Valley. These plots did not sustain tenants and the value deflated after the financial crisis of 2007–08. His debts exceed $4 million and the amount of liability depended on the outcome of lawsuits involving the defaulted loans.[75] Matheny's attorney, Robert Blitz, is handling a similar case: Fischer and Frichtel, a homebuilder who also defaulted on assets after sustaining losses over the same time period, contends that they should not be fully liable for what is termed as "deflationary debt." The St. Louis appellate court deferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri.[76] In January 2013, a circuit court ruling determined that the Matheny partnership owed The Business Bank of St. Louis $4.4 million despite economic conditions and the bank's decision to stop loaning money to Matheny.[74]

Wong Blasts Cardinals Past Giants

Comments Off   Share Article  

Mike McGinnis/Getty Images(ST. LOUIS, MO) -- Kolten Wong has tied up the NLCS at a game apiece with a ninth inning walk-off solo home run.
The Cardinals second baseman took a Sergio Romo pitch deep to right field in the bottom of the ninth, giving St. Louis a 5-4 victory over San Francisco.
"I didn't know if it was going out or not," Wong said to ESPN after the game. "When it finally went out, all emotion came out."
Not all news was good for the Cardinals. All-Star catcher Yadier Molina left the game in the sixth inning with what is described as a strained oblique. Manager Mike Matheny said Molina was undergoing further tests but that the injury, "didn't look real good."
The series resumes Tuesday night in San Francisco as John Lackey takes the hill for the Cardinals. For San Francisco, Tim Hudson will get the nod.

Cardinals Will Use Wacha out of Bullpen to Start NLDS

Comments Off   Share Article  

Scott Boehm/Getty Images(ST. LOUIS) -- St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Michael Wacha will start the National  League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the bullpen,  Cardinals skipper Mike Matheny announced Wednesday.
The  23-year-old Wacha, who was the NL Championship Series MVP last season,  has been dealing with a shoulder injury this season that caused him to  miss 11 weeks. "He's been progressively getting better, but it's a tough time to try  and continue to work on things," Matheny said of Wacha. "But we like  him. We like him in any situation, and we explained to him that there is  the potential that that could change over time. He's got to stay ready,  be available in the 'pen, and if we're fortunate enough to move  forward, things could be different."While Wacha did make four September starts, Matheny felt the youngster would be best suited starting the series in the pen. "It's been a challenge for him with the injury that he had and the time  that he took. He's made great adjustments, but right now we have to go  with the guys who we believe are going to give us the best shot."
The Cardinals also announced their starting rotation  for the series. Adam Wainwright will start Game 1 (Friday), followed by Lance  Lynn, John Lackey, and Shelby Miller.

Cardinals Clinch Playoff Spot, Lose to Reds

Comments Off   Share Article  

Major League Baseball(SAINT LOUIS) -- The St. Louis Cardinals clinched a playoff spot for the fourth straight season, but did so despite losing to the Cincinnati Reds 7-2 on Sunday.
St. Louis (87-69) reached the postseason thanks to Milwaukee's 1-0 loss to Pittsburgh earlier.
Jay Bruce hit a pair of home runs, two of the four belted by the Reds (72-84), helping Cincinnati snap a six-game losing streak. Starting pitcher Alfredo Simon (15-10) gave up just two run over six innings for the win. Todd Frazier's solo shot in the top of the sixth gave the Reds the lead for good, one that was ballooned by a Bruce RBI Single later that inning.
Meanwhile, the Cardinals must now fight for the National League Central division crown while battling a flu bug that is going throughout the clubhouse. Both Matt Adams and Matt Carpenter sat out for the second consecutive game due to flu-like symptoms.
"There are a lot of guys that are unavailable," said St. Louis manager Mike Matheny. "Almost as many unavailable as available."
Matheny also added that more than 10 players are sick, many of whom may be held back from the team flight to Chicago on Monday. The Cardinals will play the Cubs in a three-game series and currently hold a 2 1/2 game lead over the Pirates in the division.

Cardinals Reward Manager Mike Matheny With Contract Extension

Comments Off   Share Article  

Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images(NEW YORK) -- The St. Louis Cardinals haven't missed a beat since manager Tony La Russa retired and the team hired Mike Matheny to replace him, which is why they've signed him to a three-year extension.
Matheny was set to enter the final year of his contract, but now he's signed through the 2017 season.
Matheny has guided the Cardinals to a 185-139 record since he was hired. In 2012, the Cardinals reached the NLCS, and this past season he managed the team to the World Series, where they lost to the Red Sox in six games.
"I love what I do," Matheny said. "But to do it here in a place I call home is extremely special....I'm very grateful."
Matheny was no stranger to St. Louis before becoming the team's manager. He played for the team from 2000-2004, and helped lead the team to the World Series in 2004.
Overall, Matheny spent 13 seasons in Major League Baseball as a catcher with the Cardinals, Brewers, Blue Jays, and Giants.

The Boston Red Sox Win The World Series 

Comments Off   Share Article  

Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images(BOSTON) -- The Boston Red Sox won the World Series Wednesday night  with a 6-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6 of the Fall  Classic.
It was a dramatic turnaround for a team that finished in last place in the AL East in 2012 under manager Bobby Valentine.
Valentine was fired after the rough season and the Red Sox brought in  former Blue Jays manager John Farrell to turn things around.
For the BoSox, it’s their eighth championship in franchise history, and third since 2004.  
"This is for you, Boston. You guys deserve it," said David Ortiz, the Series  MVP. "We've been through a lot this year and this is for all of you and  all those families who struggled."
Shane Victorino had four RBIs for the Red Sox, while John Lackey earned the win by pitching 6 2/3 innings of one-run ball.
Boston finished the regular season with the American League’s best  record at 97-65.  In the post-season, they defeated the Tampa Bay Rays  in the divisional series in four games and took care of the Detroit  Tigers in the American League Championship in six games.
It was the first time that both teams with the best record in each  league met in the Fall Classic since 1999 when the New York Yankees  swept the Atlanta Braves.  Both the Red Sox and Cardinals finished with 97-65 regular-season records.
The Cardinals led the series 2-1 before the Red Sox clinched the title with three straight wins.  This is the first time that the Red Sox have clinched a World Series title at home since 1918.

Cardinals Arrive Late to Boston for Game 6

Comments Off   Share Article  

Mike McGinnis/Getty Images(BOSTON) --  The St. Louis Cardinals were ready to fly to Boston on Tuesday, needing to win two-straight games against the Red Sox in order to capture the World Series Championship.  The only problem is their plane would not cooperate.
Mechanical issues with their aircraft delayed the Cardinals for over seven hours in advance of Wednesday's Game 6.
While the Red Sox worked out at Fenway Park, the Cardinals remained on the runway not knowing when they would be taking off.  The team was not scheduled to workout Tuesday, so manager Mike Matheny did not anticipate the delay having much of an effect on his players.
The Cardinals plane finally took off at 9:09 p.m. ET, 7 hours and 9  minutes after the original estimated time of departure. The players  stayed on the plane through the delay.
St. Louis will send rookie Michael Wacha to the mound Wednesday night, where he will oppose John Lackey.  Both the Red Sox and Cardinals are looking for their third World Series championship in the past 10 seasons.

Wainwright Deals Cardinals into NLCS 

Comments Off   Share Article  

Eliot J. Schechter/MLB Photos via Getty Images(ST. LOUIS) --  The St. Louis Cardinals are flying high into the NLCS thanks to another dominant performance from their ace.
Adam Wainwright pitched a complete game Wednesday night, leading the Cardinals to a 6-1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.  The win vaulted the Cardinals into the NL Championship Series for the third straight year.
"I wanted it bad. It's probably the most nervous I've ever been,"  Wainwright said. "I don't get a whole lot of nerves when I pitch. Before  I pitched today, I was pretty nervous."
David Freese and Matt Adams each hit two-run homers for the Cardinals, who won the final two games of their best-of-five Division Series to eliminate the Pirates.
The Pirates won 94 games this season and made the postseason for the first time since 1992, but they were held to just two runs in their final two games against the Cardinals.  Their skipper couldn't help but talk about how proud he is of his team after the game.
"We were able to take a huge step forward this year in restoring the  pride and the passion of the Pittsburgh Pirates' organization," manager  Clint Hurdle said, "and rebonding our city with a ball team."
The Cardinals will face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS beginning on Friday.

Cardinals Edge Pirates 6-5 in 12 Innings 

Comments Off   Share Article  

Eliot J.Schechter/MLB Photos via Getty Images (ST. LOUIS.) --  The St. Louis Cardinals refused to lose Thursday. 
Matt Holliday drove home Matt Carpenter in the bottom of the 12th inning to give the Cardinals a 6-5 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
"We did a good job of bouncing back," said Holliday.  "Winning this game could be very  important for us."
Carpenter had four hits for the Cardinals, who now sit just two games back of the Pirates in the NL Central.
"Anytime having a walk-off win, it's a big deal," manager Mike Matheny  said. "Jumping on it again it today is just the resiliency of this club.
Bryan Morris (5-6) took the loss for Pittsburgh after giving up the game-winning hit to Holliday.

Cardinals Extend GM's Contract, Pick Up Matheny's Option

Comments Off   Share Article  

John Grieshop/MLB Photos via Getty Images)(JUPITER, Fla.) -- The Saint Louis Cardinals and general manager John Mozeliak agreed to a three-year contract extension Thursday. The Cardinals also exercised their 2014 option on manager Mike Matheny.
Mozeliak joined the Cardinals in October 2007. Since his arrival,  the Cardinals have averaged 88 wins a season, made the postseason three times and won the 2011 World Series.
"Since taking over in 2007, the results on the field speak for  themself," Chairman William DeWitt said of Mozeliak. "Beyond that we have total alignment  on our vision for this organization, and that is to compete year in and  year out at the major league level, and we know the only way to do that  consistently is to have a strong player procurement and development  program."
As for Matheny, last season was his first as Cardinals skipper. He led the team to an 88-74 record and finished a win short of reaching the World Series. Matheny did all of this after the Cardinals lost star first baseman Albert Pujols to free agency.

Cards, Freese Agree To One-Year Deal

Comments Off   Share Article  

Doug Benc/Getty Images(ST. LOUIS) -- The Cardinals will have their All-Star at the hot corner for at least one more season.
The St. Louis Cardinals avoided salary arbitration with third baseman David Freese by agreeing to a one-year deal on Friday.
Freese, a St. Louis native, hit .293 with 20 home runs and 79 RBIs this past season. He also earned his first All-Star appearance for his efforts. 
The fourth year player won the 2011 World Series MVP in the Cardinal's championship run against the Texas Rangers. 
The Cardinals have now agreed to terms with all arbitration-eligible players.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
