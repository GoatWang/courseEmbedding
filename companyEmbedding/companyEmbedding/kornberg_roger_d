Roger D. Kornberg was awarded the 2006 Nobel  Prize in Chemistry "for his studies of the molecular basis of  eukaryotic transcription". He determined 'how DNA's genetic blueprint  is read and used to direct the process for protein manufacture. Kornberg carried out a significant part of the research leading to this  prize at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory  (SSRL), a Department of Energy (DOE)-supported research facility located at the Stanford Linear  Accelerator Center (SLAC). Kornberg also  carried out research at the Advanced Light Source, another DOE-funded  synchrotron light source located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  ...
Kornberg was the first to create an actual picture of how  transcription works at a molecular level in the important group of organisms  called eukaryotes (organisms whose cells have a well-defined nucleus). Humans  and other mammals are included in this group, as is ordinary yeast.
For cells to produce working proteins—a process  necessary for life—information stored in DNA must first be transcribed into a  form readable by the cell's internal machinery. Kornberg's studies have  provided an understanding at the atomic level of how the process of  transcription occurs and also how it is controlled. Because the regulation of  transcription underlies all aspects of cellular metabolism, Kornberg's research  also helps explain how the process sometimes goes awry, leading to birth  defects, cancer and other diseases.'

Roger David Kornberg (born April 24, 1947) is an American biochemist and professor of structural biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 for his studies of the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied to RNA, "the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription."[4][5][6][7][8][9]

Education and early life[edit]
Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the eldest son of biochemist Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize, and Sylvy Ruth (Levy) who was also a biochemist. He earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1967 and his Ph.D. in chemical physics from Stanford in 1972 supervised by Harden M. McConnell.[2][10]
Career[edit]
Kornberg became a postdoctoral research fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England and then an Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School in 1976, before moving to his present position as Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford Medical School in 1978. Kornberg is married to biochemist Yahli Lorch. They have three children, Guy, Maya, and Gil.
Research[edit]

All organisms are controlled by their genes, which are coded by DNA, which is copied to RNA, which creates proteins, which are sequences of amino acids. DNA resides in the nucleus. When a cell expresses a gene, it copies (transcribes) that gene's DNA sequence onto a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus to ribosomes. The ribosomes read the mRNA and translate the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that gene's protein.
The DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an enzyme, RNA polymerase II, with the help of many other proteins. Using yeast, Kornberg identified the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins in transcribing DNA, and he created three-dimensional images of the protein cluster using X-ray crystallography. Polymerase II is used by all organisms with nuclei, including humans, to transcribe DNA.
Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the "flip-flop" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes. While a postdoctoral fellow working with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "Chromatin" when it is bound to proteins in this manner, reflecting Walther Flemming's discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope).[11] Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.[12]
Kornberg's research group at Stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from baker's yeast, a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.
Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed Mediator.[13] As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."[14]
At the same time as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to solve the 3-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.[15][16] He has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of RNA polymerase associated with accessory proteins.[17] Through these studies, Kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."[18]
Industrial collaborations[edit]
Kornberg has served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the following companies: Cocrystal Discovery, Inc (Chairman), ChromaDex Corporation (Chairman), StemRad, Ltd, Oplon Ltd (Chairman), and Pacific Biosciences. Kornberg has also been a director for the following companies: OphthaliX Inc., Protalix BioTherapeutics, Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.

Education and early life[edit]
Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the eldest son of biochemist Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize, and Sylvy Ruth (Levy) who was also a biochemist. He earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1967 and his Ph.D. in chemical physics from Stanford in 1972 supervised by Harden M. McConnell.[2][10]
Career[edit]
Kornberg became a postdoctoral research fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England and then an Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School in 1976, before moving to his present position as Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford Medical School in 1978. Kornberg is married to biochemist Yahli Lorch. They have three children, Guy, Maya, and Gil.
Research[edit]

All organisms are controlled by their genes, which are coded by DNA, which is copied to RNA, which creates proteins, which are sequences of amino acids. DNA resides in the nucleus. When a cell expresses a gene, it copies (transcribes) that gene's DNA sequence onto a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus to ribosomes. The ribosomes read the mRNA and translate the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that gene's protein.
The DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an enzyme, RNA polymerase II, with the help of many other proteins. Using yeast, Kornberg identified the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins in transcribing DNA, and he created three-dimensional images of the protein cluster using X-ray crystallography. Polymerase II is used by all organisms with nuclei, including humans, to transcribe DNA.
Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the "flip-flop" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes. While a postdoctoral fellow working with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "Chromatin" when it is bound to proteins in this manner, reflecting Walther Flemming's discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope).[11] Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.[12]
Kornberg's research group at Stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from baker's yeast, a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.
Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed Mediator.[13] As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."[14]
At the same time as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to solve the 3-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.[15][16] He has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of RNA polymerase associated with accessory proteins.[17] Through these studies, Kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."[18]

Roger David Kornberg (born April 24, 1947) is an American biochemist and professor of structural biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 for his studies of the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied to RNA, "the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription."[4][5][6][7][8][9]

Education and early life[edit]
Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the eldest son of biochemist Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize, and Sylvy Ruth (Levy) who was also a biochemist. He earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1967 and his Ph.D. in chemical physics from Stanford in 1972 supervised by Harden M. McConnell.[2][10]
Career[edit]
Kornberg became a postdoctoral research fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England and then an Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School in 1976, before moving to his present position as Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford Medical School in 1978. Kornberg is married to biochemist Yahli Lorch. They have three children, Guy, Maya, and Gil.
Research[edit]

All organisms are controlled by their genes, which are coded by DNA, which is copied to RNA, which creates proteins, which are sequences of amino acids. DNA resides in the nucleus. When a cell expresses a gene, it copies (transcribes) that gene's DNA sequence onto a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus to ribosomes. The ribosomes read the mRNA and translate the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that gene's protein.
The DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an enzyme, RNA polymerase II, with the help of many other proteins. Using yeast, Kornberg identified the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins in transcribing DNA, and he created three-dimensional images of the protein cluster using X-ray crystallography. Polymerase II is used by all organisms with nuclei, including humans, to transcribe DNA.
Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the "flip-flop" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes. While a postdoctoral fellow working with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "Chromatin" when it is bound to proteins in this manner, reflecting Walther Flemming's discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope).[11] Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.[12]
Kornberg's research group at Stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from baker's yeast, a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.
Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed Mediator.[13] As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."[14]
At the same time as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to solve the 3-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.[15][16] He has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of RNA polymerase associated with accessory proteins.[17] Through these studies, Kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."[18]
Industrial collaborations[edit]
Kornberg has served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the following companies: Cocrystal Discovery, Inc (Chairman), ChromaDex Corporation (Chairman), StemRad, Ltd, Oplon Ltd (Chairman), and Pacific Biosciences. Kornberg has also been a director for the following companies: OphthaliX Inc., Protalix BioTherapeutics, Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.

Roger David Kornberg (born April 24, 1947) is an American biochemist and professor of structural biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 for his studies of the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied to RNA, "the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription."[4][5][6][7][8][9]

Education and early life[edit]
Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the eldest son of biochemist Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize, and Sylvy Ruth (Levy) who was also a biochemist. He earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1967 and his Ph.D. in chemical physics from Stanford in 1972 supervised by Harden M. McConnell.[2][10]
Career[edit]
Kornberg became a postdoctoral research fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England and then an Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School in 1976, before moving to his present position as Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford Medical School in 1978. Kornberg is married to biochemist Yahli Lorch. They have three children, Guy, Maya, and Gil.
Research[edit]

All organisms are controlled by their genes, which are coded by DNA, which is copied to RNA, which creates proteins, which are sequences of amino acids. DNA resides in the nucleus. When a cell expresses a gene, it copies (transcribes) that gene's DNA sequence onto a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus to ribosomes. The ribosomes read the mRNA and translate the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that gene's protein.
The DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an enzyme, RNA polymerase II, with the help of many other proteins. Using yeast, Kornberg identified the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins in transcribing DNA, and he created three-dimensional images of the protein cluster using X-ray crystallography. Polymerase II is used by all organisms with nuclei, including humans, to transcribe DNA.
Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the "flip-flop" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes. While a postdoctoral fellow working with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "Chromatin" when it is bound to proteins in this manner, reflecting Walther Flemming's discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope).[11] Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.[12]
Kornberg's research group at Stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from baker's yeast, a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.
Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed Mediator.[13] As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."[14]
At the same time as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to solve the 3-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.[15][16] He has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of RNA polymerase associated with accessory proteins.[17] Through these studies, Kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."[18]
Industrial collaborations[edit]
Kornberg has served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the following companies: Cocrystal Discovery, Inc (Chairman), ChromaDex Corporation (Chairman), StemRad, Ltd, Oplon Ltd (Chairman), and Pacific Biosciences. Kornberg has also been a director for the following companies: OphthaliX Inc., Protalix BioTherapeutics, Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.

Roger D. Kornberg - Biographical

My adult scientific career began with graduate study in chemical physics with
Harden McConnell at Stanford. I had the idea of elucidating the mechanism
of ion transport across biological membranes by nuclear resonance. I thought
ion transport must involve rotation of the transport protein in the membrane.
Struggling to prove this wrong idea, it occurred to me to study the rotation in
the membrane of a lipid molecule, about 1,000 molecular weight, rather than
a protein fifty times larger. This led to my discoveries, by nuclear and paramagnetic
resonance methods, of phospholipid flip-flop, an exceedingly slow
process, and lateral diffusion, exceedingly fast (Kornberg and McConnell,
1971a ; Kornberg and McConnell, 1971b).
For postdoctoral work, I wanted to learn about the other important method
of physico-chemical analysis of macromolecules, X-ray diffraction. The obvious
choice was the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, where
protein crystallography was developed and still most intensively practiced at
the time. I went in the spring of 1972 to work with Aaron Klug, who was not
only a leading crystallographer, but also responsible for the application of
Fourier methods to electron microscopy and image processing. While looking
for a problem to study by X-ray diffraction, I got to know Mark Bretscher, the
only person at the LMB interested in membrane structure, and he suggested
reading a paper just published by Francis Crick titled "A General Model for
Higher Organism Chromosomes" (Crick, 1971). Figure 3 of that paper was a
diagram showing a loop of DNA crossed by a dashed line, said to symbolize a
histone molecule. When I raised the subject with Aaron Klug, he immediately
produced a sheaf of papers on the X-ray analysis of chromosomal material,
or "chromatin," known for nearly a century to contain roughly equal weights
of histones and DNA. Aaron had discussed the interpretation of the X-ray
pattern of chromatin extensively with Francis, and he encouraged me to pursue
the problem. He warned me, however, that it was a "messy" problem.
Notorious might have been a better word. Many had succumbed to the allure
  of the problem, with its potential for insight into genetic chemistry, only
  to be frustrated by the intractability of the histones. These proteins were,
  on the one hand, surprisingly simple, and on the other hand, hopelessly
  complicated. There are only five types of histone, designated H1, H2A, H2B,
  H3, and H4. Upon isolation, however, the individual histones proved to be
  extraordinarily sticky, binding avidly to DNA and interacting with one another
  in every possible combination. Whereas the X-ray diffraction pattern of
  chromatin was indicative of repeating order, the biochemical behavior of the
  histones did not appear to explain it. There was, moreover, sufficient variation
  in the relative amounts of the histone types in various tissues and organisms
  "to make the idea of a unique repeating order untenable" (Huberman,
  1973). The histones came to be regarded as a kind of amorphous glue, coating
  the chromosomal DNA, with no obvious significance.
I began by repeating the work of others, isolating the individual histones,
mixing them in various combinations with DNA, and recording X-ray diffraction
patterns. I also scoured the literature and came across two papers
that influenced my thinking. A paper by Hewish and Burgoyne reported the
cleavage of about 10% of chromosomal DNA by an endogenous nuclease
in isolated rat liver nuclei to multiples of a unit size (Hewish and Burgoyne,
1973). When I mentioned this to Francis Crick, he shot off a letter to Hewish
inquiring about the size. The reply came from Burgoyne, giving the sedimentation
coefficient of the unit length of DNA. Assuming the measurement was
made under alkaline conditions, as was customary for sedimentation analysis
of RNA, much studied at the LMB at the time, the value from Burgoyne
corresponded to about 500 bases. This unit size did not relate to any other
information about chromatin, and the appearance of multiples of the unit
size simply confirmed what we already knew from X-ray diffraction, that chromatin
contained some amount of repeating substructure.
The second paper, by van der Westhuyzen and von Holt, reported the
extraction of histones from chromatin by mild methods, rather than with
strong acid or other harsh treatment, as was customary at the time (van der
Westhuyzen and von Holt, 1971). Mild methods failed to resolve the histones
entirely from one another, so the paper was ignored. What attracted my attention
was the clean separation of the mildly extracted histones into two
groups, H2A/H2B, and H3/H4. This separation contrasted with the promiscuous
interactions of the histones previously observed. I realized this promiscuity
was likely attributable to the denaturation of histones during isolation
in the past. From the data in the paper, I could also deduce that the H3/H4
group behaved as if twice the size of the H2A/H2B group, although all four
individual histone proteins were about the same size. I concluded that H3
and H4 must form a dimer, and I thought I might crystallize and solve the
structure of this unique histone oligomer.
What followed was truly astounding. I measured the molecular weight of
the purified H3/H4 preparation by equilibrium ultracentrifugation, while
Jean Thomas offered to analyze the material by chemical cross-linking. Both
methods showed unequivocally that H3 and H4 were in the form of a double
dimer, an (H3)2(H4)2 tetramer (Kornberg and Thomas, 1974). I pondered
this result for days, and came to the following conclusions (Kornberg, 1974).
First, the exact equivalence of H3 and H4 in the tetramer implied that the differences
in relative amounts of the histones from various sources measured
in the past must be due to experimental error. This and the stoichiometry of
the tetramer implied a unit of structure in chromatin based on two each of
the four histones, or an (H2A)2(H2B)2(H3)2(H4)2 octamer. Second, since
chromatin from all sources contains roughly one of each histone for every
100 bp of DNA, a histone octamer would be associated with 200 bp of DNA.
Finally, the (H3)2(H4)2 tetramer was reminiscent of hemoglobin, an a2b2
tetramer. The X-ray structures of hemoglobin and other oligomeric proteins
available at the time were compact, with no holes through which a molecule
the size of DNA might pass. Rather, the DNA in chromatin must be wrapped
on the outside of the histone octamer.
As I turned these ideas over in mind, it struck me how I might explain the
results of Hewish and Burgoyne. What if their sedimentation coefficient of
unit length DNA fragments was measured under neutral rather than alkaline
conditions? Then the DNA would have been double stranded and about 250
bp in length. Allowing for the approximate nature of the result, the correspondence
with my prediction of 200 bp was electrifying. Then I recalled a
reference near the end of the Hewish and Burgoyne paper to a report of a
similar pattern of DNA fragments by Williamson. I rushed to the library and
found that Williamson had obtained a ladder of DNA fragments from the
cytoplasm of necrotic cells and measured the unit size by sedimentation under
neutral conditions: the result was 205 bp! I was euphoric. In the months
and years to follow, it was often pointed out how thin was the support for my
ideas and how extended the line of reasoning, but I never really doubted the
conclusions. The prediction of the DNA unit size and its verification convinced
me completely.
Support for a particulate substructure of chromatin came from electron
microscopy and from nuclease digestion and sedimentation analysis. Some
work on these lines was done even before my own, and though not definitive,
was nicely coincident with my ideas. In the years to follow, with colleagues in
Cambridge, I proved the existence of the histone octamer and the equivalence
of the 200 bp unit with the particle seen in the electron microscope
(Kornberg, 1977). This chapter of the chromatin story concluded with the
X-ray crystal structure determination of the particle, now known as the nucleosome,
showing a histone octamer surrounded by DNA, in near atomic
detail (Luger et al., 1997).
At this natural break in the work, I returned to the US, first as faculty member
of the Department of Biological Chemistry of Harvard Medical School
in 1976, and then the Department of Structural Biology of Stanford Medical
School in 1978. I had decided to pursue the function rather than the structure
of the nucleosome, and was joined in this by Yahli Lorch, who became
my lifelong partner in chromatin research, and also my partner in life. We
investigated the consequences of the nucleosome for transcription. It was
believed that histones are generally inhibitory to transcription. We found, to
the contrary, that RNA polymerases are capable of reading right through a
nucleosome. Coiling of promoter DNA in a nucleosome, however, abolished
initiation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) (Lorch et al., 1987). This finding, together
with genetic studies of Michael Grunstein and colleagues, identified a
regulatory role of the nucleosome in transcription. It has since emerged that
nucleosomes play regulatory roles in a wide range of chromosomal transactions.
A whole new field has emerged, one of the most active in bioscience
today. It involves a bewildering variety of posttranslational modifications of
the histones, and a protein machinery of great complexity for applying, recognizing,
and removing these modifications.
Although Yahli's first priority was the rearing of our children, Guy, Maya,
and Gil, she performed a series of important studies of chromatin remodeling,
believed to oppose inhibition by nucleosomes. She began with Brad
Cairns, who discovered the RSC chromatin remodeling complex. Subsequent
work showed that RSC disrupts nucleosome structure and slides histone octamers
along the DNA (Lorch et al., 1998; Lorch et al., 2001). Most recently,
we found that RSC can transfer a histone octamer to a histone chaperone
protein, exposing the nucleosomal DNA for transactions such as transcription
(Lorch et al., 2006).
For studies of transcriptional regulation, it was necessary to identify the
transcription machinery. Biochemical work, in the laboratories of Robert
Roeder, Ronald and Joan Conaway, and others, revealed the complexity of
the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery of mammalian cells, and it
was apparent there was much to be gained by studies in yeast. A combined
genetic and biochemical approach, possible only in yeast, would be advantageous
for the solution of such a difficult problem. There was, however, a
major obstacle. The development of a yeast pol II transcription system had
been attempted unsuccessfully in many laboratories for more than a decade.
Efforts to develop biochemical systems from yeast for RNA splicing, membrane
transport, and other processes had also met with failure, leading to the
widely held view that yeast, although the organism of choice for eukaryotic
genetic analysis, was unsuited to biochemical investigation. First Yahli, and
then graduate student Neal Lue, took up the challenge. Neal was eventually
successful, by changing a number of procedures and conditions used
in the past, including the replacement of chloride by acetate ion (Lue and
Kornberg, 1987). Remarkably, chloride, though a component of other transcription
systems, is highly inhibitory to yeast pol II transcription.
Neal, Ray Kelleher, and Peter Flanagan undertook fractionation of the
yeast system, followed by Mike Sayre, John Feaver, Herbert Tschochner,
Opher Gileadi, and Lynn Henry. The yeast system was problematic, since the
starting transcription signal was a thousand-fold less than that in mammalian
systems, and we soon reached an impasse. After enriching the transcription
proteins about a hundred-fold through two chromatographic steps, we could
proceed no further. Every subsequent step eliminated transcription completely.
Mike achieved a breakthrough by starting over. He realized the problem
was the loss of essential components and an accumulation of inhibitors,
and he devised a new fractionation procedure that was ultimately successful
(Sayre et al., 1992).
An important outcome of this work was the discovery that yeast and
mammalian pol II systems are the same. Differences in promoter structure
believed to reflect fundamental differences in the transcription proteins
proved to be insignificant. The real payoff, however, was in the study of transcriptional
regulation. In the late 1980s, it was thought the communication
between gene activator proteins and the transcription machinery was direct.
In 1990 and 1991, Ray and Peter produced evidence for an additional factor
required for this communication in a still crude yeast system (Flanagan et al.,
1991; Kelleher et al., 1990). This additional factor, which we referred to as
Mediator, proved elusive. The requirement for the factor was variable over
the course of fractionation. As so often happens, the solution of the problem
came from an unexpected direction. The most difficult protein of the pol II
transcription system to purify, known as factor IIH, was contaminated with
Mediator, and only after entirely pure IIH was obtained by Jesper Svejstrup
(Svejstrup et al., 1995) were Stefan Björklund and Young-Joon Kim then able
to complete the isolation of Mediator (Kim et al., 1994). To our astonishment,
pure Mediator proved to be an assembly of nearly two dozen proteins,
more than half of which were known from genetic studies in yeast to be involved
in transcriptional regulation.
In parallel with these biochemical studies of pol II transcription, we pursued
the structure of the transcription machinery. Pol II, the central component
of the machinery, is an assembly of a dozen proteins, several times the
size of any asymmetric structure determined by X-ray diffraction in the early
1980s when we began. The story of our solution of the pol II problem is told
in my Nobel Lecture, except for its origins in my graduate studies of lipid diffusion.
While I was in Cambridge, Aaron Klug and collaborators were developing
electron microscope crystallography for the solution of protein structures
too large for X-ray crystallography. As the name implies, the electron
microscope approach also requires protein crystals, only they must be thin,
preferably a single protein molecule thick, or "two-dimensional," for transmission
of the electron beam. The work in Cambridge at the time was limited
to naturally occurring ordered arrays of proteins, and it was apparent that
a general method of forming two-dimensional crystals was needed to bring
any protein of interest within reach of the electron microscope procedure.
I thought I might exploit lateral diffusion in lipid layers for the purpose.
A protein bound to a lipid layer would be constrained in two dimensions
but free to diffuse and, I hoped, to crystallize. I tried this idea, beginning
with nucleosomes and positively charged lipid layers. Finally, after repeated
failures over a period of about five years, a sabbatical visitor, Ed Uzgiris, was
successful, with the combination of a monoclonal antibody directed against
a lipid hapten (Uzgiris and Kornberg, 1983). This work led eventually to twodimensional
crystals of pol II, and then to large single crystals and the X-ray
structure of pol II.
Our biochemical and crystallographic work converged in the X-ray structure
determination of pol II. This convergence was the culmination of a
long effort, but also a beginning. Pol II associates with two dozen additional
transcription proteins and with Mediator in a giant assembly formed at every
promoter prior to the initiation of transcription. The ultimate goal of our
work is to solve this giant complex and thus to understand the mechanism
and regulation of transcription. We believe we will achieve this goal within
the next decade, through crystallography and, possibly, another development in electron microscopy. Inspired by graduate student Grant Jensen, we
have pursued the synthesis of large heavy atom clusters, for the purpose of
structure determination without crystals at near atomic resolution (Jensen
and Kornberg, 1998). This work has opened a window on a whole new realm
of inorganic chemistry and materials science, through which we may pass
into the future.

Roger KornbergOur research is directed towards the mechanism and regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription. Transcription is the first step and the key control point in the pathway of gene expression. Transcriptional regulation underlies development, oncogenesis, and other fundamental processes. 
 In eukaryotes the enzyme RNA Polymerase II is responsible for transcription of messenger RNA making pol’s regulation central to gene expression.  
  We seek to reconstitute the entire process from promoter chromatin remodeling to transcript synthesis with pure proteins and nucleic acids, to solve the structures of the proteins, and to elucidate their functional interactions.

Prof. Roger D. Kornberg | Nobel Laureate 2006Awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006
Awarded the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation’s Alfred P. Sloan Jr. Prize
Go Back 

Prof. Roger D. Kornberg is an American biochemist and Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 “for his studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription” which explained the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied to RNA. His research team isolated the proteins responsible for transcription and gene regulation, including the Mediator responsible for regulation of the process.  His research also helps explain how disease can result when transcription goes awry and offers the potential for unlocking new therapeutic approaches.
Prof. Kornberg earned his Ph.D. in chemistry from Stanford University. Following postdoctoral work at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, he joined the scientific staff there. He then became part of the faculty in the Department of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School and later returned to Stanford as professor of structural biology.  His honors include the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation’s Alfred P. Sloan Jr. Prize, Le Grand Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer from the Académie des Sciences in France, and the Welch Prize. Prof. Kornberg is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Roger David Kornberg (born April 24 1947(1947-04-24)) is an American biochemist and professor of structural biology at Stanford University School of Medicine.
Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 "for his studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription" which explains the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied to RNA.[1][2] His father, Arthur Kornberg, who was also a professor at Stanford University, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1959.
He also holds an honorary doctorate from Umeå University in Sweden.

  Biography 
Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri to a Jewish family. He was the first of three children born to biochemists Arthur Kornberg and his wife, Sylvy (née Levy), who worked together. 
Roger Kornberg earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1967 and his Ph.D. from Stanford in 1972. He conducted post-doctoral research at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, United Kingdom. He joined Harvard Medical School in 1976 as an assistant professor in the department of biological chemistry. Kornberg returned to Stanford in 1978 as a professor in the structural biology department. He served as department chair from 1984 until 1992.  He serves as the Mrs. George A. Winzer Professor in Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.
Kornberg is also a visiting professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, where he has taught and conducted research for four months every year since 1986.[3][4]
Kornberg is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

 Scientific Discoveries and Nobel Prize
All organisms are to some extent controlled by their genetic makeup. In order for the organism to make use of the information stored in the genes, a copy must first be made and transferred to the outer parts of the cells. The process by which the genes are copied is called transcription. Transcription makes an RNA copy of a region of the DNA that comprises the gene in question. The RNA is subsequently transported out of the nucleus, where it performs its function. Most of this so-called messenger RNA serves as  instructions for protein production, in a process called translation.  In most cases, proteins perform a cellular function specified by the gene. The enzyme responsible for the synthesis of protein-coding mRNA is termed RNA polymerase II. Kornberg has worked to understand this process in eukaryotes, a huge evolutionary group encompassing all organisms with well-defined nuclei, i.e., everything from yeast to humans. In contrast to bacterial RNA polymerases, eukaryotic RNA polymerases are alone incapable of gene transcription, and require a complex assembly of accessory proteins to accomplish this task in an accurate and efficient manner.
Roger Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a postdoctoral fellow working with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "chromatin" to reflect this protein packaging).[5] Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. 
Kornberg's research group at Stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from baker's yeast, a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells. 
Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed Mediator.[6] As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."[7]
At the same as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to solve the 3-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.[8][9] The structure of RNA polymerase obtained by Kornberg is the most complex protein structure solved to date. He has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of RNA polymerase associated with accessory proteins.[10]Through these studies, Kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."[11]
In 1959, Roger Kornberg's father, Arthur Kornberg, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for studies of how genetic information is transferred from one DNA molecule to another in a process called DNA replication. Specifically, Arthur Kornberg isolated the first enzyme capable of synthesizing DNA, bacterial DNA polymerase I, which was then the first known enzyme to take its instructions from a template, thus ensuring the conservation of genetic information during cellular growth and division. Roger Kornberg's younger brother, Thomas Bill Kornberg, discovered DNA polymerases II and III in 1970 and is now a geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco. All three Kornbergs have thus worked to understand how genetic information is put to use in cells. Roger and Arthur Kornberg are the sixth father-son pair to win Nobel Prizes.

<
Dr. Roger D. Kornberg, PhD – Chairman
Dr. Roger Kornberg was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry “for his studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription.”  He determined how DNA’s genetic blueprint is read and used to direct the process for protein manufacture. Dr. Kornberg carried out a significant part of the research leading to this prize at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), a Department of Energy (DOE)-supported research facility located at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).  Dr. Kornberg also carried out research at the Advanced Light Source, another DOE-funded synchrotron light source located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Dr. Kornberg was the first to create an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level in the important group of organisms called eukaryotes (organisms whose cells have a well-defined nucleus). Humans and other mammals are included in this group, as is ordinary yeast. For cells to produce working proteins—a process necessary for life—information stored in DNA must first be transcribed into a form readable by the cell’s internal machinery. Dr. Kornberg’s studies have provided an understanding at the atomic level of how the process of transcription occurs and also how it is controlled. Because the regulation of transcription underlies all aspects of cellular metabolism, Dr. Kornberg’s research also helps explain how the process sometimes goes awry, leading to birth defects, cancer and other diseases.
Kornberg On Global Stage
Dr. Kornberg has appeared before numerous public and private organizations as a voice of authority in the field of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
Following are some of Dr. Kornberg’s p[presentations and interviews:the presentations:

Roger David Kornberg (born April 24, 1947) is an American biochemist and professor of structural biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 for his studies of the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied to RNA, "the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription."[4][5][6][7][8][9]

Education and early life[edit]
Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the eldest son of biochemist Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize, and Sylvy Ruth (Levy) who was also a biochemist. He earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1967 and his Ph.D. in chemical physics from Stanford in 1972 supervised by Harden M. McConnell.[2][10]
Career[edit]
Kornberg became a postdoctoral research fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England and then an Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School in 1976, before moving to his present position as Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford Medical School in 1978. Kornberg is married to biochemist Yahli Lorch. They have three children, Guy, Maya, and Gil.
Research[edit]




Roger D. Kornberg (third from left) with Andrew Fire, George Smoot, Dick Cheney, Craig Mello and John C. Mather


All organisms are controlled by their genes, which are coded by DNA, which is copied to RNA, which creates proteins, which are sequences of amino acids. DNA resides in the nucleus. When a cell expresses a gene, it copies (transcribes) that gene's DNA sequence onto a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus to ribosomes. The ribosomes read the mRNA and translate the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that gene's protein.
The DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an enzyme, RNA polymerase II, with the help of many other proteins. Using yeast, Kornberg identified the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins in transcribing DNA, and he created three-dimensional images of the protein cluster using X-ray crystallography. Polymerase II is used by all organisms with nuclei, including humans, to transcribe DNA.
Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the "flip-flop" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes. While a postdoctoral fellow working with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "Chromatin" when it is bound to proteins in this manner, reflecting Walther Flemming's discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope).[11] Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.[12]
Kornberg's research group at Stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from baker's yeast, a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.
Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed Mediator.[13] As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."[14]
At the same time as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to solve the 3-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.[15][16] He has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of RNA polymerase associated with accessory proteins.[17] Through these studies, Kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."[18]
Industrial collaborations[edit]
Kornberg has served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the following companies: Cocrystal Discovery, Inc (Chairman), ChromaDex Corporation (Chairman), StemRad, Ltd, Oplon Ltd (Chairman), and Pacific Biosciences. Kornberg has also been a director for the following companies: OphthaliX Inc., Protalix BioTherapeutics, Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.

Roger David Kornberg (born April 24, 1947) is an American biochemist and professor of structural biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 for his studies of the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied to RNA, "the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription."[4][5][6][7][8][9]

Education and early life[edit]
Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the eldest son of biochemist Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize, and Sylvy Ruth (Levy) who was also a biochemist. He earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1967 and his Ph.D. in chemical physics from Stanford in 1972 supervised by Harden M. McConnell.[2][10]
Career[edit]
Kornberg became a postdoctoral research fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England and then an Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School in 1976, before moving to his present position as Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford Medical School in 1978. Kornberg is married to biochemist Yahli Lorch. They have three children, Guy, Maya, and Gil.
Research[edit]

All organisms are controlled by their genes, which are coded by DNA, which is copied to RNA, which creates proteins, which are sequences of amino acids. DNA resides in the nucleus. When a cell expresses a gene, it copies (transcribes) that gene's DNA sequence onto a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus to ribosomes. The ribosomes read the mRNA and translate the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that gene's protein.
The DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an enzyme, RNA polymerase II, with the help of many other proteins. Using yeast, Kornberg identified the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins in transcribing DNA, and he created three-dimensional images of the protein cluster using X-ray crystallography. Polymerase II is used by all organisms with nuclei, including humans, to transcribe DNA.
Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the "flip-flop" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes. While a postdoctoral fellow working with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "Chromatin" when it is bound to proteins in this manner, reflecting Walther Flemming's discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope).[11] Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.[12]
Kornberg's research group at Stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from baker's yeast, a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.
Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed Mediator.[13] As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."[14]
At the same time as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to solve the 3-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.[15][16] He has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of RNA polymerase associated with accessory proteins.[17] Through these studies, Kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."[18]
Industrial collaborations[edit]
Kornberg has served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the following companies: Cocrystal Discovery, Inc (Chairman), ChromaDex Corporation (Chairman), StemRad, Ltd, Oplon Ltd (Chairman), and Pacific Biosciences. Kornberg has also been a director for the following companies: OphthaliX Inc., Protalix BioTherapeutics, Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.

Roger David Kornberg (born April 24, 1947) is an American biochemist and professor of structural biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 for his studies of the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied to RNA, "the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription."[4][5][6][7][8][9]

Education and early life[edit]
Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the eldest son of biochemist Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize, and Sylvy Ruth (Levy) who was also a biochemist. He earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1967 and his Ph.D. in chemical physics from Stanford in 1972 supervised by Harden M. McConnell.[2][10]
Career[edit]
Kornberg became a postdoctoral research fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England and then an Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School in 1976, before moving to his present position as Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford Medical School in 1978. Kornberg is married to biochemist Yahli Lorch. They have three children, Guy, Maya, and Gil.
Research[edit]

All organisms are controlled by their genes, which are coded by DNA, which is copied to RNA, which creates proteins, which are sequences of amino acids. DNA resides in the nucleus. When a cell expresses a gene, it copies (transcribes) that gene's DNA sequence onto a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus to ribosomes. The ribosomes read the mRNA and translate the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that gene's protein.
The DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an enzyme, RNA polymerase II, with the help of many other proteins. Using yeast, Kornberg identified the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins in transcribing DNA, and he created three-dimensional images of the protein cluster using X-ray crystallography. Polymerase II is used by all organisms with nuclei, including humans, to transcribe DNA.
Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the "flip-flop" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes. While a postdoctoral fellow working with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "Chromatin" when it is bound to proteins in this manner, reflecting Walther Flemming's discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope).[11] Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.[12]
Kornberg's research group at Stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from baker's yeast, a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.
Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed Mediator.[13] As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."[14]
At the same time as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to solve the 3-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.[15][16] He has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of RNA polymerase associated with accessory proteins.[17] Through these studies, Kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."[18]
Industrial collaborations[edit]
Kornberg has served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the following companies: Cocrystal Discovery, Inc (Chairman), ChromaDex Corporation (Chairman), StemRad, Ltd, Oplon Ltd (Chairman), and Pacific Biosciences. Kornberg has also been a director for the following companies: OphthaliX Inc., Protalix BioTherapeutics, Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.

Roger David Kornberg (born April 24, 1947) is an American biochemist and professor of structural biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 for his studies of the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied to RNA, "the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription."[4][5][6][7][8][9]

Education and early life[edit]
Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the eldest son of biochemist Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize, and Sylvy Ruth (Levy) who was also a biochemist. He earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1967 and his Ph.D. in chemical physics from Stanford in 1972 supervised by Harden M. McConnell.[2][10]
Career[edit]
Kornberg became a postdoctoral research fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England and then an Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School in 1976, before moving to his present position as Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford Medical School in 1978. Kornberg is married to biochemist Yahli Lorch. They have three children, Guy, Maya, and Gil.
Research[edit]

All organisms are controlled by their genes, which are coded by DNA, which is copied to RNA, which creates proteins, which are sequences of amino acids. DNA resides in the nucleus. When a cell expresses a gene, it copies (transcribes) that gene's DNA sequence onto a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus to ribosomes. The ribosomes read the mRNA and translate the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that gene's protein.
The DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an enzyme, RNA polymerase II, with the help of many other proteins. Using yeast, Kornberg identified the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins in transcribing DNA, and he created three-dimensional images of the protein cluster using X-ray crystallography. Polymerase II is used by all organisms with nuclei, including humans, to transcribe DNA.
Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the "flip-flop" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes. While a postdoctoral fellow working with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "Chromatin" when it is bound to proteins in this manner, reflecting Walther Flemming's discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope).[11] Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.[12]
Kornberg's research group at Stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from baker's yeast, a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.
Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed Mediator.[13] As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."[14]
At the same time as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to solve the 3-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.[15][16] He has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of RNA polymerase associated with accessory proteins.[17] Through these studies, Kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."[18]
Industrial collaborations[edit]
Kornberg has served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the following companies: Cocrystal Discovery, Inc (Chairman), ChromaDex Corporation (Chairman), StemRad, Ltd, Oplon Ltd (Chairman), and Pacific Biosciences. Kornberg has also been a director for the following companies: OphthaliX Inc., Protalix BioTherapeutics, Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.

In 1974, Roger Kornberg worked out the importance of histones to chromatin structure.
Roger Kornberg (1947-)

Roger Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri.  He was the first of three children born to Arthur Kornberg and his wife, Sylvy.  With both parents being well-respected scientists, it was not surprising that Roger Kornberg also developed an interest and an enthusiasm for science.  As he said in an interview: 
Science was a part of dinner conversation and an activity in the afternoons and on weekends.  Both my parents had fine scientific minds and taught by example how to approach questions and problems in a logical, dispassionate way.  Scientific reasoning became second nature.  Above all, the joy of science became evident to my brothers and me.
Kornberg studied chemistry and biochemistry, and without having to think about it, became a scientist.  He graduated from Harvard University in 1967 with a Bachelors in science, and went to Stanford University for graduate work.  His doctoral thesis was on the chemical nature of phospholipids.
In 1972, Kornberg went to the Medical Research Council in Cambridge for postdoctoral work in X-ray crystallography.  There he became interested in the X-ray patterns Aaron Klug obtained for chromatin.  Using this and other experimental data, Kornberg eventually worked out the importance of histones to chromatin structure.  Kornberg published his results in 1974.
Kornberg stayed on staff at the MRC until 1975 when he was offered an assistant professorship at Harvard University.  In 1978, he moved to Stanford University where he is now professor of structural biology.  
Over the past 35 years, Kornberg has published over 150 peer-reviewed research papers on phospholipid and chromatin structure, gene regulation and transcription control.  His current research interest is on the overall structure of chromatin and chromosomes and how such structuring may be associated with gene repression. In 2006, Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry “for his studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription."
Kornberg used to play the violin as a child and likes to read.  However, he admits that his main interest outside of science revolves around his family.



Roger Kornberg's brother, Thomas, is also a scientist.  He isolated DNA polymerase III used for replication.  Kornberg's other brother is an architect and designs research laboratories.

Why are there eight histones to each nucleosome?  Wouldn't it be easier to have one large protein?

DNA is packaged in a chromosome.
Higher cells incorporate an ancient chromosome.
Some DNA does not encode protein.
Some DNA can jump.
Genes can be turned on and off.
Genes can be moved between species.
DNA responds to signals from outside the cell.
Different genes are active in different kinds of cells.
Master genes control basic body plans.
Development balances cell growth and death.
A genome is an entire set of genes.
Living things share common genes.
DNA is only the beginning for understanding the human genome.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
