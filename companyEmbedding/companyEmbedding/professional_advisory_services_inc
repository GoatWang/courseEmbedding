What are analysts saying about Pfizer stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Pfizer stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio as well as key pipeline milestones through acquisitions and licensing deals. New products like Ibrance and contribution from acquisitions are expected to drive revenues. Also, cost-savings and share buybacks should help Pfizer achieve its earnings guidance. Investor focus will remain on the stock as Pfizer has several key pipeline milestones in 2017. However, genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition remain potent headwinds. Mounting competition in the immuno-oncology market is also a significant concern. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the large-cap pharma industry this year so far. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. Estimates have remained stable ahead of its Q2 earnings release. " (7/14/2017)
2. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "We are highly confident the deal will close as the purchase agreement removes IP risk and development risks, and creates significant shareholder value. We believe there is minimal risk for the deal being blocked due to anti-trust considerations CTP-543 Phase IIa initiated with top-line results expected 1Q18. The phase IIa trial will enroll approximately 100 patients spread across 4 active arms of differing doses (4, 8, 12 and 16 mg BID) and a placebo comparator. The primary endpoint for the trial will be measured using the severity of alopecia tool (SALT) after patients undergo 24 weeks of dosing. An additional 28 weeks of dosing of CTP-543 is planned for all patients enrolled in the study. If successfully developed, we anticipate a significant pricing discount for CTP-543 relative to Jakafi – owned by Incyte (INCY, Non-Rated). The earlier delay to initiate the trial due to clinical supply delays, which lasted around 2 months, has been resolved." (4/27/2017)
3. UBS AG analysts commented, " The FDA approved Novartis' CDK4/6 agent, Kisqali (ribociclib), in first-line treatment for HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer in combo with any aromatase inhibitor. Recall that MONALEESA-2 was stopped early, and while interim data demonstrated a reduction in risk of disease progression or death by 44% over letrozole alone, the mPFS had not been reached at the time. For the first time, the label presented a mPFS of 25.3 mos for Kisqali + letrozole vs 16 mos for letrozole alone. The 9.3 mos improvement over letrozole is essentially comparable to 10.3 mos improvement (24.8 mos for Ibrance vs 14.5 mos for letrozole) for Pfizer's Ibrance. Given the strong interim data that were comparable to Ibrance, we believe the approval of Kisqali was largely expected. Our takeaway: Label looks a little worse than Ibrance. Overall, we think the label looks slightly worse, particularly on safety. On the positive, the label is broader, as the indication is for use of Kisqali in combo with anyaromatase inhibitors (vs Ibrance in combo with letrozole). However, as the vast majority of first-line use letrozole, the broader label shouldn't meaningfully impact Ibrance, in our view. We're not clear on how Kisqali got the broader label, but we think this could be encouraging for Ibrance, as the Ibrance label could also become as broad with the potential April approval of the confirmatory Phase 3 PALOMA-2 (Ibrance was approved under an accelerated pathway with Phase 2 PALOMA-1 data). On safety, the Kisqali label warns of QT prolongation and liver tox, which are not in the Ibrance label. We think the QT issue could put Kisqali at a disadvantage. Thoughts on the stock: Shouldn't impact the stock much, if anyIbrance has been on the market for ~2 years and has made significant headway to becoming a standard of therapy, and we do not believe there was anything in the Kisqali label that would meaningfully impact the significant lead that Pfizer has. In our CDK4/6 model, we assign a 5% share for Kisqali in 2017 that goes to 15%, 18%, and 20% in 2018-2020E." (3/14/2017)
4. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "We wanted to highlight a key data catalyst in which a positive outcome can drive shares higher: PIIa data for XEN801 for mod-to-severe acne in the latter part of Q1 (JEF est: ~Mar). We continue to like the risk/reward going into the data, especially on the heels of Dermira’s positive PIIb data for DRM01, which operates on the same pathway but more upstream. Reiterating Buy and $13 PT. Highlighting Key PIIa Data Catalyst in Latter Part of Q1: We wanted to take the opportunity to highlight a key data catalyst in which a positive outcome can drive shares higher: topline PIIa data catalyst for XEN801 for moderate-to-severe acne in the latter part of Q1 (JEF estimate: ~Mar). We previously conducted a review on XEN801 in April ’16, which can be found here, and now that the data catalyst is drawing near, we wanted to take the chance to highlight it again. To recap, the PIIa trial is a randomized, double- blind, multicentre, vehicle-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of patients with moderate-to-severe acne. The trial will compare XEN801 topical gel (1%) and matching placebo gel for 12 weeks with a 4-week follow-up. XENE has randomized 165 patients (v. 150 that was planned at conception), and has 85% power (v. 80% previously) to detect a ~16% difference." (1/19/2017)

Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 9 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.42)Consensus Price Target: $38.00 (15.15% upside)
