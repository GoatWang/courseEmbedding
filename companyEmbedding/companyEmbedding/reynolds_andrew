Andrew Reynolds Reviews Cash On Demand. Scam, or Does it Live Up To The Hype?

The name Andrew Reynolds has been around for many years, and reviews are aplenty. If you have been looking to generate income from the internet, then you will probably have seen the products, Cash On Demand for example, is one of Reynolds main products. Does it work?
We at UKDropshop.com look to dispel the myths surrounding online opportunities, and we always offer unbiased information, and reviews on what does, and does not work, so that our members can avoid the obvious scams out there. Let’s see if we think Andrew Reynolds and his products can help you.
Who is Andrew Reynolds, and What is Cash On Demand?
Andrew Reynolds is a marketer of products that claim to make money. It is that simple. Whether those products make money is an entirely different question. Andrew will tell you a story about his humble beginnings, and how after not being satisfied with his ‘lot’ decided that he wanted to make some serious money, and then jetted off to America to a seminar; learned how to make money, etc. etc.
The fact is, that Andrew Reynolds managed to obtained the rights to various video courses, in which he then went onto sell to customers mainly in the UK, under the business Manhattan Direct. The subject matter of the vidoes? You guessed it: Making money.
Does what Andrew Reynolds teach actually work?
Well, anything can work if the right person is trying to gain results, can’t they? The problem as we see it, is that if the actual person who is selling the products to business opportunity seekers have not themselves made some money using the same advice, then it kind of becomes the blind, leading the blind, surely?
Let’s face it. Everybody wants to make extra money, and if you are presented with a professional sales letter, written by the people who know how to persuade others to make a payment for goods, or service, then this becomes a very enticing business to become involved with. This is the whole ethos of the majority of ‘biz-opp’ marketers. They sell what people want to buy, and in this instance the product is ‘how to make money’. If the promoter has made their OWN money using the sames methods suddenly becomes a secondary question, which is fast forgotten about in the midst of the professional sales letter.
What about Andrew Reynolds and his Cash On Demand Subscription?
Cash On Demand
Cash on Demand is about ‘finding a niche and filling it with a product’. The cliche is massive online, to the point that although it is so obvious, actually taking advantage if it, has been forgotten.  There have b
een countless marketers who have sold similar, and will continue to sell similar, especially now the internet has blossomed into a marketers dream. All Cash on Demand has done, is stretched the principle out to very many modules, that are now sold on a monthly subscription. Similar information can be found for free, if the researcher genuinely LOOKED for it.
Sure, the principles work, but it is nothing new. It is similar to the old adage of ‘find a problem, then creating the solution, and becoming wealthy in the process’. BUT, this does not mean that you will become successful in creating an income on such obvious principles. In fact, the chances of doing this are minuscule, BECAUSE, if you, as a human being do not possess the actual acumen to generate a business, or have enough desire to make money, then no matter how many manuals, or modules you read, it simply will not happen.
Are you saying Cash on Demand does not work?
We are not saying that, but we ARE saying that Cash on Demand is nothing new, and in our experience, the chances of you succeeding using the modules will entirely depend on you as a person. If you have enough desire in your life to make a sincere decision to make money, then you will make it irrelevant of how many ‘golden’ modules you have read from the latest ‘guru’. Think about it, genuinely; If you really HAD to make money, then you could. If you had a loved one who absolutely depended on you making a certain amount of money, for their welfare, or well-being, then do you feel you would be able to do it? Of course you would.
Making money is an extremely emotional subject, because when you break it all down, the level of income you can achieve, will directly result in the level of your life-style, security, and the life-style of those you love and represent. And therefore, the next time you read one of the sales letters offering to make you £$X per month/year, just sit back and really assess if you have what it takes, or if you have enough genuine desire to make it; because if you don’t, then you won’t – it is that simple.
Would you recommend Andrew Reynolds and his products?
We personally feel, that although the principles are nothing new, and probably do work, that they are global principles. The same information can be found much cheaper elsewhere. Maybe not the same modules, but the principles of finding a niche and filling it, most definitely can be found cheaper than spending a monthly amount to gain, and wait for, access to a product such as Cash on Demand.

Been there and got the t-shirt with andrew reynolds, bought 13 modules of cash on demand, and still did not make any money. I sold them all on ebay in the end. Carl.

To the above poster, it is correct. I also purchased some of the manuals about cash on demand off ebay for a greatly reduced price. If you are interested i would purchase from there instead.
I never thought they were much benefit to me personally as the content was extremely basic, and the internet has moved on somewhat since they were written.

My friend bought Andrew Reynolds course.
I looked at the video with him and realized you could get this stuff off the internet for nothing. So anyone out there thinking of buying it, don’t waste your money.

Hello Paul. That is the trouble, this stuff seems old hat now, and the basics of what is being taught by Andrew Reynolds in these course are being given away by bloggers for free.

It always raises the question in my mind, if these people are making so much money so easily from these schemes they are selling, why do they need to make more money selling the ‘how to’ information?
If it were me, I’m afraid I would albeit selfishly perhaps, keeping the secret all to myself and making even more money, without feeling the need to sell my methods!
I’m not saying for a moment no-one ever has made their fortune from these schemes, but I think two sayings should be remembered by anyone thinking of spending their hard earned cash on any of these schemes:
1. “You get nothing for nothing!”
2. “If it seems too easy, it probably isn’t!”
I have lost a considerable amount over the years following these “get rich quick” gurus and have’t yet done much with them except line the guru’s pockets!
Regards,
John R.

These people make money by selling you the “How To” rubbish, they wouldn’t make a penny by listening to their own advice, complete rubbish. See through it folks!

I have taken on board the above comments, I must say that I have every confidence in the system. I know it works because I have seen Andrew live at entrepreneurs boot camp 2009 and I have shook his hand. Okay it has not made me a fortune YET, However! that is my own fault because the solutions that you have to find first is obtaining a regular income through the so called employment system first before you embark on any ventures such as Andrew’s.
There are 3 lessons to be learned here folks.
Belief is the truest word in English Dictionary here. Andrew is a self made millionaire, and the first lesson one should learn here is the famous quotation ‘ALWAYS LEARN FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY SUCCESSFUL’
The second and third lesson are all to do with mindset.
Mindset is a very powerful tool and will get you to where you want to be, but it does take a daily focus. The second lesson I want to share with you is to do with positive and motivational training. What you need to do everyday and I mean this everyday is picture in your mind what it would be like if you never had to worry about bills making that heavy thud upon your doormat. How would you feel if when you opened those bills you had a bank balance that would take care of them always.
The third lesson and last but not least is this. 
I currently work as a part time retails sales demonstrator, my work is varied, one week I can be offering food samples in one of the big 4 to the public and the next I could be demonstrating mobile phones, fridges, washing machines or even power tools. One day I took an exercise which was totally self invented. I was due to food sampling at a very large Asda store in Bristol and I invented a short formula which was DETERMINATION + APPLICATION = SUCCESS. I Kept saying that to myself in my mind at least 5 times consistently in every hour. My day changed dramatically, my sales figures did too and I the feeling I had was tremendous.
I hope this has been very useful information for you folks.

I did not make a penny using this system. What I did create was a large debt which will have to be paid off next year when I will have no option but to cash in my pension to cover it!
I told Andrew Reynolds office about this. They were not interested, with no mention of a refund. In fact, Reynolds continues to send me written literature about new schemes. Quite audacious I think!

It’s a week now and I’ve studied the course watched the DVD’s read the manuals it looks appealing but I must admit I still have no idea if it works but one thing I can tell you I’ve learnt a hell of a lot and I mean just scratching the surface I’ve read cash on demand manual  cover to cover I’ve read copy this idea I’ve watched The £500,000 challenge DVD as how I pulled in £50 million also millionaire secrets it all looks so easy and I await the modules I’ve read the above forum notes is it a scam or not? All I can tell you in 1 week not even started yet I have negotiated permission to have the rights for one project free the second project I have lined up I have bought the domain name and made some positive enquiries for a product to sell exclusively which is a sure fire winner!! All this in one week even made contact with a local fulfilment house putting things in place and guess what? I still have not a clue how it works but for 42 years I’ve been a dell boy ducker and diver market trader made loads of money selling bullshit dressed up as a quality item with this system I see great potential but let me tell you only time will tell but if I’ve done these 3 things in under a week what can I achieve when I finished the modules yes it’s a gamble but life is a gamble but let me echo the words of Andrew Reynolds ‘You have to stack the cards in your favour’ and being a barrow boy all my life it’s time for a change I don’t gamble any more I stopped on Horses dogs and casino’s I’m clean for 6 years it’s been an addiction that cost me a lot I only gamble now in business I’ve taught myself Ebay and took advice and its been a sure fire winner it’s put me on another level to the extent that I don’t get up 5 am anymore to stand in all weathers come home making little or no money after expenses This if handled correctly can be a success the last blog summed it up beautifully it’s all down to the individual and his or her mindset Determination- Application – Success a winning formula !! In all honesty with an open mind and positive thinking you can make anything work with being positive and all I can say if after this opening week I’ve achieved 3 things by listening and learning for you see The only way to change something is by doing something different only time will tell if this works or not structure and success is a winning formula but if u don’t try u don’t get my advice give it you’re best shot!!

I did subscibe to andrew reynolds cash on demand scheme a few years ago now and to be honest although it exposed the basics of internet marketing setting up websites and producing products which would sell to people is a very grey area indeed. The costs involved are quite prohibitive for most people when you link some of the costs to the pay per click system for websites and to be frank i’ve have never known anyone who has paid these reported sums for information from the kind of websites andrew reynolds promotes. People do not part with two or three thousand pounds for a box of cd’s and a download on how to make money on-line this is total nonsense and i have some doubts as to whether andrew reynolds has made the fifty million pounds he says he has selling information products on-line. Andrew Reynolds cash on demand scheme is something he apparently constantly promotes, the content hasn’t altered since i foolishly subscribed to it and i see that in the last year he published a book on the subject, has anybody actually bought it out there ? I’ve been invited on several occasions to the seminars he promotes but to be honest i can think of nothing more boring than attending one of these and certainly see it as a money making exercise for the other people he brings along who sell there cd’s etc to numerous gullable people. To sum up, if andrew reynolds has made the sums of money he says he has those days are over, people have become wiser to information products on-line and the evidence that andrew reynolds and his colleagues are now scratching around for income is in the amount of sales letters that come through your door every few weeks from him. My advice to mr reynolds is that you should be satisfied with your fifty million and retire in luxury somewhere which would then relieve those of us who receive your sales letters from ‘ NOT RECEIVING THEM ‘!

Extract from review of Andrew Reynolds Cash on Demand:

 2. Not yet rich  ... Andrew Reynolds decries the "junk business 
opportunity manuals written by broke people trying to get you to run an idea which is barely workable.  
For a start ask any of the people that wrote them to prove their claims.  And they won't simply because 
THEY CAN'T!  ... they CAN'T show you the profits ... they CAN'T show you pictures of their lifestyle 
... they CAN'T show you their bank statements ... " etc.    So you need to ask Andrew 
Reynolds how you are going to overcome the hurdle of you, too, being unable to show your potential customers 
the profits, show the pictures of your lifestyle, show your bank statements etc. 
Whilst I have been informed that Andrew Reynolds' Cash on Demand system teaches 
you how to overcome such obstacles, this is such a fundamental point that I recommend 
prospective purchasers to discuss it with Andrew Reynolds as part of their pre-purchase 
research.
 3. Exclusive licences  Andrew 
Reynolds advises Cash on Demand students NOT to buy an exclusive licence when they find some material 
to market.  But it is conventional business wisdom to try to secure an exclusive deal if you are 
on to something good, to avoid being swamped by competition when other people who see that a licensed 
product is selling well can then easily obtain a licence for themselves.  You need to ask Andrew 
Reynolds whether he holds any exclusive licences and to explain how you are going to avoid competition 
if you buy non-exclusive licences.  Whilst I have received confirmation that licensing is explained 
in detail on the course, the purchase of an exclusive licence could be a substantial expense, so again 
I think that readers who are interested in the Cash on Demand opportunity should discuss this issue with 
Andrew Reynolds before they buy.  4. How to get customers  This point concerns 
the be-all and end-all of any business: how are you going to get your customers?  We had the impression 
that Andrew Reynolds got his customers by means of bought-in large mailing lists which he then used to 
send out mass mailshots (because BOARD members sent to us for our review mailshots they had received by 
post from Andrew Reynolds) and of course this is an expensive marketing method.   
So you need to ask Andrew Reynolds what method or methods he uses, and what method 
you are supposed to use.  Although, once more, we have received confirmation 
that this information is covered in detail on the course, nevertheless it will 
be the crux of your business so you need to get some outline idea of the main 
marketing method beforehand, so that you can assure yourself that there is a clear 
and proven recommended method and that it will be workable for you and will be 
within your budget ........ (review of the Andrew Reynolds' Cash on Demand 
System continues)

        Hi everyone, I am hoping someone can answer a question for me. 
I was on the andrew reynolds cod course and there is something i am a bit confused with. 
I wondered if he goes into a niche promotes his front ends then his backends but then drops the whole niche altogther after a couple of months or does he stay in a niche until he does not profit from it any more? 
Anyone with their thoughts if you are also on the course would be good. 
Thanks

                                    I can not speak for Andrew Reynolds or any other person in business, but if I had paid for a web site for a year or two years and it was still generating traffic and income, I would be happy to leave the site there giving me money each month. 
Why abandon something you will have (or should have) put quite a bit of work into ?

                                    Hi,
I have subscribed in the past but only really scimmed the content - my understanding is that Andrew has only ever really been involved in one niche - the business opportunity, making money, direct mail, self improvement call it what you like it all amounts to the same target market in general terms. He did, does and will continue to make money from this niche via Direct Mail and also his tv channel on Sky (ec.tv) 
He is indirectly involved in other niches i believe in so far as he will sell you licences (suitable for front and backend offerings) to other niche specific products, tell you where to buy direct mail lists etc etc etc and show you how to profit from them using the techniques you learn in the Cash On Demand Course BUT I believe none of the products (licences) you buy for resale will come with any kind of Sales Letter for you to use (I may be wrong but that is what I have been told). You will have to go out, get the sales letter written, get testimonials to show 'proof of concept', build a list of customers with your front end product that you can then sell your backend offerrings to. 
Hope this helps
Will

You're right.  He does move on to another product after he has squeezed as much out of one product (front end and related backend product), usually within two-three months.   
He concentrates on direct mail rather than putting up a website to which the general public can visit to buy his products.  Unless you have received a letter from him by post, you won't know what product(s) he has to offer so finding his sales sites which are password protected, anyway, would be impossible. 
All his sales come from private invitations and those he operates with very select few JVs.  Once done with one set of products, he passes on these product licences to his top priced coaching students who use them as advised.  These students still managed to squeeze at least six figure sums from the sales. 
He used to (may still do) buy exclusive licences from abroad so no one else had the products that he was selling in a given country.  He has long since moved into product development, himself, so he now issues licences to his products (various niches) to members who subscribe to the many levels of memberships he offers.  These products are very, very good and as a former member, I just struggle to find time to set up websites for the licensed physical products already received.

 I have been involved with him many years ago in a so called joint venture and did not make a penny (lost money mostly). 
 I can't say how good his system is now?  I do wonder though why anyone who claims to have made £ 50 Million  (British Pounds)  would still need to sell his book on Amazon for £7.00 (British Pounds). 
 I did learn one thing though,  don't dig for Gold but sell shovels and picks to those who want to dig  at the end of that Rainbow.

                                    I would not waste my time if I were you. 
Remember that 1000 or so people will have the same exact licenses as you do and will be using the exact same system as you have been taught and will be using the exact same lists. 
I assure that at the end of the day, the only person who will make a killing is Andrew Reynolds. Not you. The only way you can avoid it is if you have several thousand pounds (£10,000 or more) to spend on a killer copywriter (like the one he uses) and to to buy some great leads. Otherwise...save your money. 
The dude made a killing on some forex training course by vince somebody that was totally c@#p. He repeatedly sold the final 30 seat seminar to about 200 people every fortnight for $10,000. The guy is a brilliant marketer but he is not going to help you make a dime. 
On a side note, the guy made a big deal about quitting the direct marketing world a few years back. Surprised he is still at it. I guess it was all just another marketing gimmick.

I think you're missing the whole point of his cash on demand system. You get a product license. He also provides you materials to be able to at least write your own sales copy for the front end/backend the way he did when he first started. 
If you do actually put some effort into it, you'll get those sales copies up - and get a few mailings, make some money from the front end/back end offer, after which you'll re-invest that money and do a bigger mailing and even pay a copywriter to clean up ur copy or do a better one.

First mistake you are making is believing that you know how he started. He is a marketer remember. Do not believe any story he tells you. Be with him long enough, you will hear different stories of how he started, based on what he is peddling. 
If you think you can write copy to sell a £300 +  product by cutting and pasting, I think YOU are probably missing my point. 
Please re-read my post and try to understand what i am telling you. Working hard has nothing to do with it. I know in the seminars he will tell that only 1-2% of people will actually make money from his system because they work hard and implemented his system and that the other 99% are lazy and will do nothing with the info.  
Don't drink the Kool-Aid. I have warned you so do not complain when you learn the hard way and are several thousand pounds poorer. 
I know that you may want to believe in a dream of financial freedom from some unique off the shelf "system" that you have bought into. My experience and those of many others is that his system was not it based on the reasons I gave you. 
Search for the name of the person and scam to see some other opinions.

Have you actually bought any of Andrew's products and, if so, have you implemented any of the ideas given?  Or are you merely repeating unfounded "scam" reports by those who buy products, do nothing with them and then moan? 
I don't think you are aware of just how many millionaires Andrew has personally helped (albeit at a fee) to create.  Let me enlighten you with the names of just two. 
Nick James (go and see his site at Nick-James.com).  Nick was a car park attendant before he came across Andrew and enrolled on his more expensive course and he's gone on to make several million pounds sterling within a very few years. 
Time Lowe is another who uses both online and offline marketing techniques taught by Andrew to make even more millions than Nick in even less time. 
I, and others, rely on the WF for honest, factual reviews of products that a Warrior has actually bought and tested for themselves (ie implemented rather than allowing it to gather dust).  It's getting rather tedious to read comments that serve no purpose but to tarnish the reputation of marketers who are not here to defend their good name.

I give up man. 
I would not be advising you if I had no direct knowledge of what i am talking about. I have seen those same 2 or 3 names of Tim Lowe and Nick James as success stories for nearly a decade now. What you may not know is that they are all in the same team. 
Goodluck! I truly hope you become the 3rd success story out of the thousands of people who have attended his seminars and bought his dvds/videos. I also hope you are not the 99.9% of people who are just too lazy to succeed with his system.

                                    It's hard for me to make a decision on this when people put their opinion down very strongly then admit they never tasted the product.

                                    hi guys 
for what its worth looked into this an found some concerns  
His book Copy This Idea which I recently purchased and  enjoyed and made a testimonial for see on youtube is a good and inspirational read, although it is directed towards the cash on demand course  
this is where the problems arise in my humble opinion - there is no syllabus or breakdown of course or indeed how many modules to complete
from looking in deeper apparently there 36 3 years worth of subscription at going rate think it was £29.95 a month  
there is no option to buy whole course upfront so your pretty much in there for  the long haul should you decided to stick it out - most don't and quit without getting the full picture, also people sell his course cheap on Ebay, those modules all were picked up for £100 form one guy. 
Although I understand subscription and membership models I think know there are better courses out there with clear content and also a definitive end time 
one I would recommend as highly valuable is Jonathan Minzel's Traffic Evolution course 6 months and brilliant content and structure.   
 I know Andrew knows how to market and has a wealth of experience in the business world but this course is a no for me because of above - its just not structured towards the student but more towards the master and I think as far as investment goes its a poor option hope this helps

                                    And remember, he started doing this when the World Wide Web was in its infancy. The internet is flooded with marketing/junk/spam products now. Most people largely ignore them these days but back then there were far less people doing it and audience ignorance will have given him a much higher chance of a sale. Since then the market has been saturated and people have wisened up to not pay any attention to spam. If Andrew Reynolds started doing this today, would he become a millionaire? Probably not. Like anyone buying his courses today, you're in the right place at the wrong time.

                Google collects data from its own search engine and also through Google Analytics.
Why bother counting backlinks if google already knows which sites are popular?.
