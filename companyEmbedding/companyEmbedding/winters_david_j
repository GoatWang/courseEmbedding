Biography[edit]
David joined Mutual Series in 1987, during Max Heine's tenure. Heine died the next year, so David was mentored in value investing by Michael Price. One key component of his value investing methodology is not to just buy at a discount, but to help management unlock that potential value as an active investor.[1] He also looks for value where others don't want to look and is willing to go the extra mile in finding ways to invest money.[2]
He was named Director of Research of Mutual Series in 2000 and President and CIO in 2001. During his time with Franklin Mutual Advisors, he was also the portfolio manager of the Mutual Discovery Fund from February 2000 to May 2005.[3]
After leaving Mutual Series in 2005, David formed Wintergreen Advisers and the Wintergreen Fund in Maine, United States.[3] The companies are named after the official state herb of Maine, the wintergreen. He was encouraged by others to open a less-regulated hedge fund, but opted to run a comparatively strictly regulated mutual fund.[4] He said in his characteristic nice guy manner that: "Mutual fund is a truly democratic way. You can invest your friends' money. It is nice to be able to do a nice job for people who need the money."[2]
As of October 2006, David is also currently a sub-advisor for the Renaissance Global Market Fund, operated by CIBC Asset Management.[5] In December 2006, Winters was selected as one of four participants in the tenth annual global investing round table hosted by the International Herald Tribune.[6]
Personal[edit]
He loves trains and railroads, from toy train sets to riding real trains, and has since he was young.[7] He also idolized value investor and future employer Max Heine during his younger years, keeping a news article about him taped to his dorm room ceiling in college.[8]

 Biography




 




September 29, 2012


If you want to know what stocks David J. Winters likes, you can pore over his 13F filings or just look at his miniature train set. Winters' family-room features a "tour de railroad" with all the typical hills and dales. But his train also makes some unusual stops: at a casino to honor his big position in Malaysian gaming giant Genting Malaysiaand at a chocolate factory whose smokestacks spew a sweet smell to reflect his Nestlé stake.  "Kids understand what we do right away," says the 50-year-old...

Searching the Globe for Undervalued Jewels
Why the chief of the Wintergreen Fund avoids leveraged financials and health-care stocks, but loves Swatch, Richemont, Canadian Natural Resources, and Wynn Macau.

Lawrence C. Strauss

 Biography




 




March 23, 2013


David Winters' portfolio holdings change over time, but not his investing approach. The Wintergreen Fund (ticker: WGRNX), which he launched in 2005, holds about 30 stocks, with the 10 largest positions accounting for half of its assets.  A global value investor who preaches patience, Winters, 50, is a big believer in the view that thorough stock research provides an edge over the competition. That isn't surprising, considering that he...
