This head by the Maori sculptor Arnold Wilson was one of the most popular pieces in a very successful exhibition of his work which recently travelled around the North Island under the auspices of the Community Arts Service. Mr Wilson, an art teacher at the Bay of Islands College. Kawakawa, is one of the best sculptors working in New Zealand today.


Sometimes, like a number of other modern New Zealand artists, he is influenced to some extent by traditional Maori and Polynesian sculpture. The head we illustrate here is unmistakably modern—and yet there is something very familiar about it, especially in the treatment of the eyes and forehead.


We hope to have an article on Arnold Wilson's work in a later issue of Te Ao Hou.

A Terrific Rugby Trio
by Kara Puketapu
It must be most gratifying to followers and players of Rugby to see so many Maoris achieving high honours in the code. The year 1962 will be remembered from the Maori Rugby viewpoint as being one of the finest ever. Two of New Zealand's best loose forwards on the international field, Waka Nathan and Victor Yates, were Maoris, and then eventual recognition was given to the brilliance of Mac Herewini, a first five-eighth with a glorious future in the sport.

Provincial Teams Also
Nor is such prominence to be found only on the international plane, for there are also to be found strong and continual challenges by increasing numbers of Maori players for position in provincial teams. To recall a few, there were:
Porima, Raureti (Waikato).
Maniapoto, Walsh, Herewini, Pryor, Nathan, Rangi (Auckland, holders of the Ranfurly Shield).
Nicholls, Taitoko (Manawatu).
Walters, Yates (North Auckland).
Tapsell, Orme, Taiaroa (New Zealand Universities).
Mahupoka (Wairarapa).
These are only a few of them; there were dozens more.
In the East Coast, Hawkes Bay, Counties, King Country, Taranaki, and the other provincial sides Maori players were present in large and representative numbers. New Zealand can boast of having many excellent Maori rugby players right down to Club level.


Among ‘Greats’ of 1962
In picking out the ‘greats’ of 1962 it would not be permissible to go past the northern quartet of Walsh, Herewini, Yates and Nathan. All but Walsh, a past All Black of some distinction, made the 1962 New Zealand team that toured Australia and played the Australian touring side in New Zealand later in the year. I feel that Walsh was most unlucky in not being selected to an All Black side this year. He has been the pivot and ‘nursery man’ for the brilliant Herewini—a combination upon which Auckland shield successes must have rested strongly.
As individuals, this year's All Black trio proved themselves as true internationals. Victor Yates, though his form was not what it was in 1961 against the Frenchmen, still showed that he will be a very strong contender for the British Isles tour in 1963–64.
Mac Herewini, even if he keeps only reasonable form, can ‘pack his bags’. The same can be said of Waka Nathan, and perhaps there will be other Maori players on the scene as well next year.
The trio are an example of the trend in Rugby which I discussed last March in ‘Te Ao Hou’. Maori backs have always been a feature

N.Z. Herald Photo
Mac Herewini scoring a magnificent solo try in the Ranfurly Shield match, Auckland v. Taranaki, last September


Mac Herewini, whose photo is on the cover of this issue of Te Ao Hou, comes from Mokai, a tiny mill settlement north-east of Lake Taupo. When he was seven his family moved to Auckland, and for a period of two years in his early teens, he was an apprentice jockey.
His career very nearly ended at one stage during this time, when a savage horse reared, threw him and fell on him. As it fell, one of the horse's hooves struck the young boy in his chest. The injury was extremely serious—but if it had been an inch higher, it would certainly have been fatal. At this stage Mac rode at 6 stone, a tiny wisp of a boy. At 5 ft. 7 ins. he still looks pretty small on a football field, but he's now a strongly built 11 st. 4 lb., and once he's in action it's exceedingly clear that his height is no disadvantage to him.
Mac worked for a time with his great friend Waka Nathan on meat-boning contracts at the Westfield works, but then he took up drain-digging work. He has his own special machine now, is his own boss, and is doing very well at it.
He's also a good tennis player, though there's been less time for this since his marriage, and especially since the birth of his daughter—‘a great little kid’—a few months ago.

of New Zealand rugby but now Maori loose forwards are also coming into their own, and it seems that Maori players will again be contributing their bit to the continued supremacy of New Zealand in international Rugby.
Let's hope that next winter another grand effort from Maori sportsmen will be forthcoming—meanwhile, to all players from Club to International, the ‘has-beens’ and ‘will-bes’ can say ‘thank you for a magnificent year’.


We would very much like to be able to print more news in ‘Te Ao Hou’, and would be grateful for more contributions from readers—accounts of meetings, weddings, obituaries, photographs, and anything else of interest. They don't have to be long, and they don't have to be very carefully worded; you can always leave this to the editor, if you wish. We are always glad to receive stories, articles and poems, also. All published contributions are paid for.
Due to a mis-print, we referred in our last issue to the Hon. J. R. Hanan, Minister of Maori Affairs, as the Hon. J. R. Hanana. When we noticed this later we were rather embarrassed for a moment—till we realised that we had in fact simply given Mr Hanan the Maori version of his name, and what's wrong with that?
If you see a reference to a Mr J. K. Hana in ‘Te Ao Hou’ at any stage, it'll probably turn out to be Mr Hunn in his Maori disgui

Letters to
The Editor
The Editor,
‘Te Ao Hou’.
In your last issue Mr Atihana Johns writes that the ‘hate’ between Maori and pakeha lives on because ‘our [Maori] sense of history does not allow us to forget’. May I suggest—


1
The word ‘hate’ is very much too strong for the mutual distrust and shyness which is often to be found, to a varying extent, between the two groups. If Mr Johns were to live for a time in one of the countries where there is GENUINE racial hatred, he would quickly learn how different the real thing is.



2
If it is true that the Maori ‘sense of history’ produces distrust and shyness on the Maori side (and I think there may be a certain truth in this), then it is time Maoris acquired a different sort of sense of history.



I should like to draw Mr John's attention to the situation at the moment in Europe. The French and Germans possess a highly developed sense of history. They were at each others' throats only 17 years ago, as well as at frequent intervals before this. But the French and German sense of history extends into the future as well as into the past, and they can therefore see that it is now historically essential that they should become closely co-operating friends. Hence the European Common Market.
I agree with Mr Johns in his mention of the difficulties facing those Maoris who must, of necessity, move into ‘the asphalt jungle’. What he says about this is very true. But it seems to me that the pakeha who wrote the article to which he refers was not criticising Maoris because of these problems. He was trying to help.
‘PONO’ (Wellington)

We invite letters to the editor on any subject mentioned in ‘Te Ao Hou’. Letters signed with the writer's name are preferred, but we publish anonymous letters provided that the writer's name is included as a sign of good faith. The editor reserves the usual right to shorten letters if this is necessary for reasons of space.
With the last issue, ‘Te Ao Hou’ celebrated its tenth birthday. This seems a useful moment to ask readers to tell us what they think of us—to say which things in ‘Te Ao Hou’ they specially enjoy and which things they may feel they see too much of; and to suggest any new subjects on which they should like ‘Te Ao Hou’ to publish articles.
For instance, would you like to see more articles on traditional, cultural subjects—or fewer of them? And on which particular cultural subjects?
More features on personalities and topical news—or not so many?
This is YOUR magazine—let us know what you want, and we'll do our best.

In the next issue of Te Ao Hou we are publishing a special supplementary Booklet containing a long article written in 1922 by the late Sir Apirana Ngata, and re-published here for the first time. In this important article the great leader examines the meaning and modern relevance of the Treaty of Waitangi. This is a subject of very much interest to all New Zealanders, and it is fitting that the re-publication of Sir Apirana's article coincides with the forthcoming visit of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth to Waitangi.
Sir Apirana's article, written with his usual eloquence and lucidity, is in Maori. Since we publish an English translation as well, the booklet will also be of great value to schools, and to all who are learning Maori.
This 32 page Booklet, published through a grant by the Maori Purposes Fund Board, is included entirely free with each copy of the March issue of Te Ao Hou.

Letters to The Editor
The Editor,
‘Te Ao Hou’.
As one of the relatively uninitiated but enthusiastic audience members at many Maori concerts, may I add my plea to the suggestions made by Alan Armstrong in your September issue? Would performers on stage, men in particular, please not act as if most of the show was an amusement for slightly feeble minded children? Time and time again an otherwise enjoyable performance is marred by those in the rear who give the impression that they are fairly bored with the programme, and are able only to survive the evening by passing derogatory remarks to one another, or by repeating the refrain backwards. The fine points of technique, of gesture and of mood, we know little about, but movement, timing, costuming—they are so obvious, speak so loudly of able or slipshod preparation …
The public carries away an image—that image is all too often the only one they can call on when discussing Maori culture …
Whatever it is that's at stake, whether tribal or racial mana or Sir Apirana's Maoritanga, something has to be done fairly quickly. The concert party is a salient as it were, a cape thrusting out into a sea of—well, I'll leave that to the individual to decide.
A. D. Chadwick (Rerewhakaaitu)
The Editor,
‘Te Ao Hou’.
Thank you for publishing the Maori Fishing Calendar by Mr Taumaunu which you had in the last issue of ‘Te Ao Hou’. I was very glad to see this as I have been trying to get hold of one for a long time.
It may be worthwhile reminding your readers, however, that if they do not live in the Gisborne (Turanga) district they may have to make some adjustments to the times Mr Taumaunu gives. This is because they depend to some extent on the tides, and these of course vary in different parts of the country.

Kehua !  Kehua !
Kehua !
by Jo Friday
I had a beach-house once, he said, a bach or crib, or whatdoyoucallit, out Ahipara Beach. Used to go there weekends, me and my dog. Nice dog, sheep with a bit of gun-dog in him, just enough so that he wasn't gun-shy. Intelligent, too. Nice companion.
Beauty weekends, they were. Swimming, hunting in the hills, along the tops, or up to the gumfields when the wind was blowing off the sea, picking up the gum uncovered from the sand. Funny country, that. Sand way up on top of the hills, making out to be snow, and weird shapes carved out by the wind, and blue-gray, pink-gray driftwood, leaning all shadowy, and skulls along the deserted beaches, and rifle-shots ringing round if you tried to pick them up. Beauty times, me and my dog had then. Miss them now, in a way.
Why did I sell the house? It was a nice house, an ordinary house, you know. That's what makes you scared. An ordinary house, glad to be there, homely, fire in the grate, comfy and cosy. Dog by my knee, asleep and me with a good book, content that it's soon to bed.
That's what makes you scared. Like any other house, it was. Enter happy as you please, with no chills down your back, no warning voices in your head.
A quiet evening, this was, as long and dark and silent as the grave. One of those nights when you catch yourself listening for noises, because you can't believe it can be that quiet. But no sound but the uneasy whining and pacing of the dog, and the half-heard whisper of the sea, and when there is a sudden rustle and tap on the side of the house you jump a bit, you're that startled. It's funny how the rustle of a tree and tapping branch can startle you, when it's dark and still and silent of an evening, and there's an uneasy dog by your side.
Tap, tap. It was a bit further along the wall this time. The dog whimpered, as he pressed himself hard against my knee. Tap. Further along still. Tap, tap … tap. Funny how your imagination works. It sounded almost like a hand being placed against the wall for support. Or asking to be let in.
I stood up, and listened uneasily. The taps now sounded as if they had progressed round the corner, and were moving along the other wall. The dog was moaning, not angry, but real scared, real scared. Are dogs psychic?
Tap, tap along the wall. And then silence, complete silence, with uneasiness and sneaking fear creeping through my mind and muscles. Shaking myself, I picked up a torch and went outside. The dog wouldn't come.
Silently the torch beam flicked mistily over wall and stones and unrustling grass, bringing reassurance and fear because it showed nothing, no evil shadow in the shadows, but no cat or moving branches, either.
‘Nothing there, nothing there,’ I said, but

locked the door behind me … just in case. The dog ran crouching to me numbly asking for reassurance. ‘Nothing there,’ I said, and the dog shook, and whined miserably.
So I went to bed. What is it about bed-clothes that gives you that childhood comfort, the gripping of the sheets about your chin when your body is stiff with uneasiness that you won't confess, not even to yourself?
There was no more tapping, but still the dog was restless, moving in circles so that nothing could creep up behind him, and high-pitched growls of apprehension were coming from the back of his throat.
And then he backed up against the bed, rigid and shaking.
The noise came up the corridor. Tap. And then two shuffles. Tap, shuffle, shuffle. An old man crouched over a walking stick.
Tap, shuffle, shuffle.
Who is it, what is it, the questions tear through your mind, and the dog is shaking, shaking, and you are getting out of bed, hardly knowing what you are doing.
Tap, shuffle, shuffle. Closer, closer. You look out of the door. Tap, shuffle, shuffle.
There is no-one there.

The Primate of New Zealand, the Most Rev. N. A. Lesser, has announced that the Rev. Canon Te H. (Dan) Kaa, B.A., L.Th., who comes originally from Rangitukia on the East Coast, has accepted an invitation to serve in the South Island.
‘Canon Kaa will be licensed to the Dean of Christchurch Cathedral, but will exercise a roving commission to work among Maori people throughout the diocese. In addition to this work, the Bishop of Christchurch will readily and willingly agree to Canon Kaa's being available from time to time to assist Maori work in the diocese of Dunedin and Nelson.
‘Canon Kaa took his degree in 1951 and his L. Th. in 1932. He has served all his ministry in the Waiapu Diocese, having been Vicar of Taupo, Waipawa Maori pastorate and Vicar of Moteo Waipatu (Hastings) since 1950. He has served Waiapu Diocese in many capacities, including membership of the standing committee and Maori mission committee.’






Many Maoris Elected
to Local Bodies
Maori candidates won seats on a number of local bodies in the elections on October 13, and in a number of districts Maori candidates made local history by being the first members of their race to gain local body selection.
In Auckland, Mr A. Awatere, a welfare officer and former commanding officer of the Maori Battalion, was elected to Auckland City Council.
Others to pioneer Maori representation were Mr L. Rangi (Hamilton City Council), Mr W. Proctor (Pukekohe Borough Council), Mr T. N. Tuhimata (Tuakau Borough Council), and Mr Sam Mihaere, Palmerston North City Council. Mr Mihaere is a Maori Welfare Officer.
The first Maori to be elected to Ngaruawahia Borough Council for about 20 years, Mr C. B. Ingram, topped the poll.
Mr P. Tapene was returned to Onehunga Borough Council, also topping the poll.
Two Maoris were elected to Rotorua City Council, the deputy-mayor (Mr P. H. Leonard) and a newcomer, Mr R. Paraire.
A Maori, Mr R. P. Emery, was re-elected to Te Kuiti Borough Council, and Moerewa, Northland, gained its first all-Maori county town board, and Manurewa Borough Council includes a Maori, Mr W. Pratney.
In the Wellington district, Mr Ralph Love was elected to Wellington City Council, while his nephew, Mr Peter Love, was elected to Petone Borough Council. Mr Steve Watene was re-elected to Petone Borough Council.
?
A major step in familiarising primary school children with the Maori language is now being taken by the Education Department, the Chief Inspector of Primary Schools, Mr J. Ewing has said in Hamilton.
Mr Ewing told the annual conference of the New Zealand Education Board's Association that a bulletin entitled ‘About the Maori Language’ was now being prepared. It was not a formal textbook but would describe aspects of the Maori language, pronunciation, numerals and everyday phrases.

Maori Golf Contest at Napier





W. J. Godfrey, Auckland amateur golfer and defending title-holder, forfeited two holes and still won comfortably from J. Matehaere, Te Awamutu, to take the men's title at the New Zealand Maori golf championship at the Waiohiki links, near Napier, last August. He beat his chief rival, Tom Ormsby, Otorohanga, 5 and 4 in the semifinals.
Since then Godfrey has distinguished himself at the recent World Series in Japan, when he broke 69 and helped to take New Zealand to a close third in the first round.






Mrs Audrey Mullany, Napier, won the women's championship after a 24-year break; as Audrey Tareha she took the title once-before in 1938. The semi-finalist was Miss M. Winterburn, Otaki, whom she beat 4 and 3.

Success for
Jewellery Maker

Mr Raana Riwaka, of Petone recently became the first disabled civilian to complete a full-time trade-training course at the Disabled Servicemen's Centre, Wellington. He is now a qualified paua jewellery manufacturer.
He was presented with his trade certificate by Mr D. G. Ball, chairman of the Maori Education Foundation.
For Mr Riwaka the qualification was the culmination of four years' unceasing effort. He started his training when he was 17; he is now 21.
Mr Riwaka was described by an officer of the Wellington centre of the Disabled Servicemen's Re-establishment League as an inspiration to others, both Maori and Pakeha. He is incapacitated through poliomyelitis and unable to walk without crutches. After contracting the disease, which has paralysed him from the waist down, Mr Riwaka spent several years under the care of the Crippled Children Society and gained his education during that time.
The society is so impressed with his efforts and record as a pupil that it has made available a car for his private use.

The Rev. Father I. Gupwell, S.M., Rector of St Paul's College, Feilding, recently celebrated the silver jubilee of his ordination to the priesthood.
Father Gupwell has been at St Paul's since it began in 1947, and has been largely responsible for its growth. The College was started by the Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington at an approximate cost of £110,000 and 800 boys have since passed through.
Parents and old boys from North Auckland, Gisborne, Hawke's Bay and Taranaki, the South Island and other areas, were among the 1,000 people who visited the school on the occasion of Father Gupwell's silver jubilee. They took part in services of thanksgiving, ate hangi-cooked food, made presentations to Father Gupwell, and heard a Maori concert in his honour by present pupils and 50 visiting girls from St Joseph's College, Greenmeadows.
During the function Mr Tano Nikora spoke for the Maoris in Southern Hawke's Bay, Wiki Christi for Northern Hawke's Bay, Tiro Putu for the Manawatu, Hoani Haami for the old boys of the Wanganui River and Georgina Kingi for St Joseph's College. Many others joined in tributes to the Rector and staff of St Paul's College.

Mr Alec McKay, who has just retired, has been one of the pakeha officers of the Maori Affairs Department best known to the Maori people.
Mr McKay, an Irishman, came to New Zealand in 1919. Till 1930 he was engaged in sheep and dairy farming in the Waikato. During this time he became particularly conversant with the breaking-in of undeveloped land.
Soon after his arrival he became associated with King Koroki and Princess Te Puea and ever since has been the confidant, friend and adviser of the Waikato ruling family.
In 1938 Mr McKay joined the Maori Affairs Department at Wairoa, being appointed overseer at Raupunga the following year. He studied at Lincoln College in 1940, graduating with the Diploma of Valuation in Farm Management. In 1941 he went to Hamilton as Assistant Field Supervisor, but later the same year went in to the army.
He served overseas for three years with the 2nd NZEF in Egypt, Italy and Japan, and became Adjutant of the Divisional Cavalry Regiment.
On returning from overseas in 1946 Mr McKay took up the position of Field Supervisor in Hamilton. He was later transferred to Opotiki and then Whangarei. In 1950 he became Administration Officer, Rotorua, and a year later was promoted Assistant Director of Maori Land Settlement.
In 1956 he became Controller of Maori Land Settlement and in 1957 was appointed Assistant Secretary for Maori Affairs.

The Payment
another ‘Eruera’ story
by E. S. Morgan

Eruera sat on the sunny back-door step whacking a tin with a stick. In the tin grew a gnarled stumpy old cactus which his mother treasured. Sometimes Eruera played with the long tough cactus spines, drawing with them in the smooth-trampled clay of the back-yard, or testing his courage by pushing one slowly into the tough skin under his big toe, until he could bear it no longer. Once a spine had snapped in his fingers, and a little black spot showed where part of it still remained in his toe. Eruera stared at that spot now, his fat brown foot clutched to his jersey.
At the sound of children's voices, Eruera dropped his foot and the stick, and ran to the gate. There were his school mates, Nino, Paul and Isaac.
‘We're going fishing Eru, you coming?’ they called. In two minutes Eruera had found his fishing-line under the verandah, and the four were on their way to the jetty. But they didn't go straight to the jetty. There were too many pleasant things to do along the way. There were walnuts to gather under the huge tree that overhung the road. There was the culvert where the taniwha answered you with long booming calls when you shouted into it. They never stayed long at the culvert, and no-one ever stopped there or shouted into it when he was by himself.
They stopped at a ricketty wooden gate and stared for a minute or two at a little white cottage.
‘There's good ginger beer in that house,’ said Isaac.
‘That's my Aunt Sophie's house. She gives me ginger beer any time,’ Eruera said grandly.
‘Go and ask her for some now,’ said Nino.
At the back door Eruera called timidly ‘Hullo, Aunt Sophie,’ but was glad there was no answer. The other boys coughed and whispered and stared around. There was a little shed there, its door open and half off its hinges. Inside was a crayfish pot, a bundle of flax, and rows of brown bottles, their corks tied down with string. There were a lot of bottles, and Aunty Sophie was kind. Eruera was sure she would want them to take a bottle. They opened it with Nino's sheath-knife.

It didn't taste as good as they had expected, and when they had passed the bottle round twice it was still only half-empty. Paul was just about to say he had had enough, when the bottle fell from his hand, and smashed on the concrete floor. They took one quick look at the glass splinters and the spreading pool, and then they were outside the ricketty gate again and heading for the jetty.
After this the boys were quiet for a long time. They swung their bare legs over the jetty edge, drawing patterns in the water with their toes. The sun was very hot on their backs. ‘Perhaps she'll think it burst itself,’ said Isaac.
They caught a lot of fish that day. Some spotties, four blue cod, and a kitful of herring. ‘We'll take her the cod,’ said Nino, threading them on to some flax.
This time, smoke was coming from the chimney of the little white cottage. Old Aunty Sophie was surprised to see them, and more surprised when they gave her the fish. ‘You the good boys,’ she said. ‘You come back Monday and I give you ginger beer. Not ready yet. Give you pain in te puku.’ She stood at the door, her old eyes soft with love in her brown wrinkled face, the bundle of fish in her thin knotted hands. ‘The good boys,’ she murmured to their departing backs, and went inside.
Eruera could see Maui's flax ropes reaching from the sky to the Piripiri hills, and all yellow in the setting sun, when he reached his own gate. He walked very slowly up the path to his house. He had caught a, lot of fish, but he wasn't very happy, and besides, his puku felt queer.

The life story of the Maori bass singer, Inia Te Wiata, will shortly be presented by the British Broadcasting Corporation in a half-hour recording of song and personal narrative.
It will be part of a series of programmes entitled “My Song Goes Round the World” and will be produced by another New Zealander, Mr Andrew Gold, formerly of Auckland, who is on the staff of the B.B.C.
Many distinguished performers from different parts of the world have already taken part in this programme. Inia Te Wiata has chosen for his half-hour the songs which he regards as particularly significant during his career, and in most cases he will sing them in chronological order.
He will open with a song ‘Aue Te Iwi E’ (‘Oh, My People’), which he first recalls having heard chanted by the elders of his village at Otaki when he was seven years old.

This article on Henare Tate, who has recently become the second Maori priest ordained into the Roman Catholic Church, comes from Father Wanders of Panguru.

He kupu whakamarama tenei mo te tamaiti nei mo Henare Tate kua whakatapungia hei pirihi.

He Kupu Whakamarama
Mo Henare Tate

Kua roa a Riki raua ko tana kuia ko Meri e noho tahi ana tetahi ki tona hahi, tetahi ki tona hahi. Kua eke te kaute o nga tamariki ki te toru. Katahi ka uru mai te whakaaro ki roto i te hinengaro o Meri, me huri mai a ia ki te whakapono o tana kaumatua, a ka huri mai.
E kopu ana a Meri i taua wa. Na, te whanautanga mai o te tangata hou ki te ao, he tama wahine, Ko Herapia te ingoa i huaina ai ia i te ra o tona iriiringa; ko te tau 1910. Ka tupu ake, ka wahinetia ia, ka moe tane, ka whakawhanau tamariki ki te ao, ko Hohepa, ko Hori. Ko te toru o nga tamariki, ko Henare Arekatera, i huaina ki tona matua atawhai, ki a Henare Noa. I a ia e noho ana i Motuti, a kura ana ia ki te kura kawangatanga. He wa ano ka hoki kia kite i nga matua mo etahi ra, he wa ano ka haere tahi raua ko tona tupuna ki te hao ika i te awa nui o Hokianga. Te mutunga i te kura ka whiwhi ia ki te karahipi, a ka tukuna e tona matua atawhai ki te kura kareti o Hato Petera.
I reira ka tupu ake te whakaaro i roto i a ia me te hiahia hoki ki te tunga pirihi. He marama no te matenga, he u no te whakaaro, he piri pono ki te karakia, te kotiti ai a Henare i te huarahi e ahu atu ana ki te taumata, ara te whakatapunga pirihi i te ra 30 o Hune. Ka whai hoa a Pa Wiremu te Awhitu, ka tokorua raua kua oti te whakawahi hei pirihi hei hoa mahi mo Hehu Kerito.
Ma te Atua koe e tiaki, e manaaki e Pa Henare; kia maha rawa ai o tau i te mara o te Ariki hei painga mo tou iwi, te iwi Maori.
‘He ra ka taka ki tua—a takoto te pai—hi, hi, takoto te pai’.

This true story of heroism is based on the account given in Percy S. Smith's ‘Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century’, 1910. Te Aokapurangi and her husband Te Wera later went to live at Mahia, and it was there that she eventually died.







How Aokapurangi Saved Her People

This story concerns a woman of high rank, Aokapurangi, who belonged to an Arawa sub-tribe which lived on Mokoia Island in the middle of Lake Rotorua.
Around about 1818, when she was a girl, Aokapurangi was on a visit to Maketu when she was taken prisoner by Te Wera, an important chief of Nga Puhi. Te Wera took her north to his home at the Bay of Islands, and made her his wife. He treated her kindly, and as the wife of such an important man, and a woman of great strength of character, she came to have considerable presting among her husband's people, living there happily for several years.
Then, in 1822, trouble arose. Nga Puhi, who had been able to acquire a great many muskets from early settlers in the north, and from their leader Hongi Hika's visit to England, had for some years been sending down war parties which slaughtered great numbers of people in the southern tribes; for very few of these other tribes possessed muskets.
On one of these expeditions a party of Nga Puhi were treacherously killed by the Tuhourangi, a branch of the Arawa people who had been urged to do this by Te Rauparaha. However a few survivors escaped, and returned to the Bay of Islands to tell of this disaster.
When Nga Puhi and their leader Hongi heard the news, they immediately determined upon revenge; they also decided that this would be a useful opportunity to attack the entire Arawa Tribe, who at this time were very numerous, but who possessed almost no muskets. Accordingly a great expedition was planned, and people gathered at the Bay of Islands for this purpose from far and near.
When Aokapurangi heard that her own people on Mokoia Island were to be among those slain, she pleaded with her husband Te Wera to ask Hongi to spare them. Te Wera was very reluctant to do this, but she wept so loudly and urged him so strongly that in the end he conveyed her request to Hongi. Hongi, also, had no wish to allow her people to live, but finally he said grudgingly that he would permit her to save the lives of any of her people who passed between her legs. (This was an ancient ceremony which gave new life to the person concerned—for example, it was sometimes part of the ritual by which a tohunga cleansed someone who had broken the laws of tapu.)
So Hongi and his great fleet of canoes sailed from the Bay of Islands down to Tauranga, and then on to Waihi, the shallow harbour just to the east of Maketu. Here they entered the Pongakawa stream. This stream flows from Lake Rotorua in the Rotorua district, but for some miles of its course it is subterranean, and for much of the distance its valley is very narrow and rugged.
In spite of the very difficult nature of the country, Nga Puhi dragged their canoes right up this valley to the place where the stream emerges from its underground course. Here they cut a track through the dense bush, and with great labour dragged their canoes overland along this route. (This is why the road just south of Lake Rotorua is still known as Hongi's Track).
The Arawa people knew of the approach of the Nga Puhi expedition, but it did not occur to them that Hongi could possibly bring his war canoes with him. They therefore thought that the best thing to do would be to gather on Mokoia Island, taking all their canoes with them and laying in great quantities of food and water, so that they would be able to withstand a siege. So all the time that Hongi and his men were dragging their canoes overland, the Arawa were gathering provisions and making more weapons—spears, taiaha, and other rakau Maori.
Shortly before Nga Puhi arrived, some of Te Arawa wanted to abandon Mokoia, for they had only one musket between them in the whole tribe, and they greatly feared the Nga Puhi guns. Also,

they knew that if they were defeated there would be little chance of escaping from the island. But most of the people were defiant of Nga Puhi, and it was decided to stay to defend Mokoia, which was very dear to them, being associated with five hundred years of their history.
Then Hongi finally reached Lake Rotoehu, and took the canoes overland again to Lake Rotoiti. From there he travelled up the Ohau stream into Lake Rotorua.
By this time all the Arawa were crowded on to Mokoia, having taken with them a great quantity of provisions, expecting that they would have to withstand a long siege.
Then to their horror, they woke one day to see through the morning mists the shapes of canoes on the opposite shores, and knew that they were at Hongi's mercy.
For two days Nga Puhi did not land on the island, but amused themselves by circling around it, and as they passed the Arawa canoes drawn up on the bank, each chief claimed one of them as his own by calling it after some part of his own body, and thereby rendering it sacred to himself.
On the third day Nga Puhi landed. Hongi led the way, a fearsome figure as he stood upright in the canoe flourishing his mere and chanting a war-song, the sunlight shining on the steel helmet which had been given to him in England by George IV. Behind him was the fleet of war-canoes, bristling with muskets; before him was the great host of Te Arawa, with the one musket amongst them.
Just as his canoe touched the shore, the Arawa warrior who possessed the musket crept behind a flax bush and fired at Hongi. He was hit on the head, and fell down into the canoe—a great cry rose from Te Arawa, but Hongi stood upright again in a moment; he had only been stunned, for his steel helmet had saved him.
But for a short time this happening caused a panic among Nga Puhi, and this panic gave Aokapurangi her opportunity. She had been in Hongi's canoe with her husband, and now she jumped on to the shore. She remembered Hongi's promise, that all who passed between her legs should be saved, and she ran to the great carved meeting-house in the village. She stood on the carving over the door, her legs over the entrance—and she called out to her people, ‘It is Aokapurangi, come back from the north! Come inside your house, you will be saved!’
Te Arawa were fighting bravely, but were defenceless against Hongi's muskets. Very great numbers of them were killed, but many heard Aokapurangi's voice and fled to the house. All day she stood there, with buildings flaming around her, calling to her people, and all day they crowded into the meeting-house; and such was Aokapurangi's mana that those who reached the house were saved, the warriors of Nga Puhi did not venture to attack them.
Some others managed to escape by swimming to the shore. Some of Nga Puhi pursued them in canoes to secure them as slaves, and often they succeeded, though sometimes, when the canoes became full of Arawa captives, they turned on the northern warriors, killing them with the paddles and escaping into the forest with their bodies.
At the end of the day Te Aokapurangi obtained permission from Hongi to go in search of her uncle Hikairo, who was hiding in the forest. She took him to Hongi, and a peace was made; as a token of this peace, Hongi gave Hikairo his steel helmet, which was given to him by George IV and which had just saved his life from the Arawa musket.
Nga Puhi remained at Mokoia for many days, living on the ‘fish of Tu’. Then they returned the way they had come, taking many prisoners with them; some of these later returned, and some became the wives of their captors.
This was the last time that Nga Puhi ever fought with Te Arawa. The name of Aokapurangi, who saved so many of her people from destruction, and was responsible for a lasting peace between the peoples, is still famous; and still, when a meeting-house is crowded full of people, the saying is sometimes heard.

‘Ano ki te whare whawhao a Aokapurangi!

‘This is like the crowded house of Aokapurangi.’


The carved meeting-house in which the people sheltered was called Tamatekapua, after the original ancestor of the Arawa. The big meeting-house which stands at Ohinemutu today, the one where dances are held and in front of which tourists photograph each other, is also called Tamatekapua. Some of the carvings in this house are very old indeed (though some of the old ones are partially obscured now by a dance-band platform), and it is likely that some of them formed part of this older Tamatekapua on Mokoia, 140 years ago.


Mrs Mayla Ngawhika of Rotorua has gained top marks for New Zealand in a theory examination for basketball referees. Mrs Ngawhika, a former Rotorua basketball representatives, has been a member of the Rotorua Referees' Association for four years and is a provincial referee. Her mark, 96 per cent, is particularly outstanding. As the mother of seven children, she has little time to devote to studies.
Another Rotorua referee, Mrs D. Anaru, gained 94 ½ per cent in the same examination.

Selwyn Wilson: Artist and Teacher by Jocelyn Tarrant





As well as being a very good potter, Selwyn Wilson is having great success as a teacher of art.


In the recent North Island Inter-Secondary Schools' Art Competition sponsored by Bing Harris and Co., there were over 2,000 entries —and Northland College pupils gained the distinction of being awarded both first and second prizes. The two prize winners were Raewyn Bedggood, first, and Hera Ripia, from Ohaeawai, second. Another pupil, Mary Ayrton, was highly commended and fourteen others received certificates of merit.
It is to Selwyn Wilson, their art master, that these pupils, the school, and many adults in the community are quick to acknowledge a debt. Apart from showing his skill as an artist, Selwyn's lessons are highlighted by his very real interest in the progress of his pupils and a fund of stories with which to grip the attention of any listener.

Ngati Manu Tribe
Selwyn belongs to the Ngati Manu tribe. When he was born, at Taumarere in 1927. Selwyn was given the name Te Ngareatua by his grandfather, who prophesied that this, the youngest child of Kapu Reweti and Peter Wilson, would be a special child who would achieve distinction.
After attending the Kawakawa District High School, he went to study at the Elam School of Art. He could have chosen a well-paid position

This pottery of Selwyn's is some of the work he did while he was in London. Several of the pieces he made at that time are now in the permanent collection of the art school he attended there.

in commercial art, but Selwyn accepted instead the offer of a position as Itinerant Art Specialist for secondary schools in the area between Waihi, Te Aroha and Katikati. After three years he went back to Elam to complete his Diploma of Fine Art in 1951. While he was still a student he also taught part-time at Wesley College and at Mt Eden Prison.



Study in London
In 1957, after working with the Art section of the Department of Education in Auckland, Selwyn was awarded a Sir Apirana Ngata bursary to study ceramics at the Central School of Art, London. Unfortunately his studies were cut short by illness in his family, but nevertheless he did very well in London. Some of his pottery was placed in the permanent collection at the Central School, and he has also sold much of his work. Though pottery is his main interest he is also a painter, and two of his paintings are in the collection at the Auckland Art Gallery.
When he came back to New Zealand, Selwyn looked for a teaching position near his home. He was glad to accept one at Northland College, for while he wishes to service his Maori people, he is most interested in teaching where Maori and European are together. It is rewarding for him, and perhaps symbolic, that the winners of the competition should represent both races.
Selwyn finds his days well filled with his school duties and in maintaining his family home, but even so he freely gives his time to evening classes and adult education courses. At the moment this leaves no opportunity for him to continue with his own pottery and painting, but he hopes to start again next year. We certainly hope this will be so.
Many pupils like Hira Ripia, who started art classes by saying, ‘Wi, sir, but I'm no good!' have gained confidence by finding, with Selwyn's guidance, that they never know what they can do until they try. At least three of Selwyn's pupils have continued in art; Margaret Sampson of Waihi has completed her Diploma of Fine Art and is now teaching at Otorohanga, while Mere Harrison of Ruatoria and Buck Niu of Kaikohe are students at Elam.
When he was asked to what he considers his success is due, Selwyn replied doubtfully, “‘Success?”—Well, anything I have achieved has been due to hard work, tenacity, and to the determination of my parents.’

We have received a request for a Maori penfriend from Mr E. J. Pilkington, of 727 East 8th Avenue, Vancouver 10, B.C., Canada.
He writes that he would like a penfriend, regardless of age and sex, to whom he could send pictures and information about Canada, and who could send him pictures and information about Maoris and New Zealand.
Mr Pilkington is in his late 50s, a war veteran, and an Anglican by faith.

Under the Sale of Liquor Bill introduced in Parliament by the Minister of Justice and Maori Affairs, Mr Hanan, it is made illegal for hotels to refuse accommodation, meals or liquor to any person because of race, colour, nationality or beliefs.
Mr Hanan said this was a new provision which he was sure all Members of Parliament would welcome.

Don't let them take risks—they're far too precious for that.








Safety in the Water
by S. V. Higgins

Maoris are twice as likely to die by drowning as other New Zealanders!
There are statistics to prove this startling fact. In the 12 months ended April 30, 1962, the 122 people who were drowned included 18 Maoris—one seventh of the total. But the Maori population is approximately one-fourteenth of the total population of New Zealand; the Maori drowning rate is therefore twice that for the whole population.
Six of the Maoris drowned during this time (one-third of the total) were 15 years or younger. Five were men between 21 and 30 and two were men in the 31–40 age group; some were married men with families.
The six children were all young lives full of promise which a growing race can ill afford to lose. How did they die? These tragedies can teach us how to keep young lives safe.
Two boys under five drowned while playing in water (a river and a lagoon) with other children, but without an adult or responsible teenager to look after them. You should never let toddlers near water of any sort without someone to protect them. To be absolutely sure they are safe when playing around the house, the yard must be securely fenced and the gate kept shut.
If possible all water hazards—wells, troughs, tanks, reservoirs, sheep dips, and drains, as well as creeks, rivers, lakes, ponds and pools dangerously close to the house—should be made harmless by fencing them off. When you can, cover them over.

Children Need Watching
How many water hazards are there on or near your property? It would pay to look round and do something about it. Prompt action could save lives.
Three older children, aged between 5 and 10, drowned while swimming. It is hard for parents with large families of young, adventurous children to keep their eyes on them all the time, but it is surely better to let the work suffer than to lose a child.
The loss of seven men in the prime of life was also a tragedy for the Maori race. One drowned when a dinghy was swamped while negotiating

treacherous seas at a river mouth. Another man, and a married woman in her forties, were killed when a dinghy was swamped in a swell.


Care In Boats
If you use small boats you shouldn't go out when the sea is rough or the weather is threatening. Your boat should be in good condition and properly equipped. Even an outboard runabout needs oars and rowlocks, in case the motor breaks down. An anchor, rope, a spare bung, and a bailer are also essential.
Everyone in a boat should wear a lifejacket. None of the 39 people drowned in accidents to small boats last year was wearing a lifejacket. They might all be alive now if they had.
In another accident, youths clung to a capsized canoe and were saved. The other man tried to swim to the shore, and drowned. If a boat capsizes and doesn't sink, it is safer to cling to it than to try to swim to the shore. A man clinging to a boat will find it easier to stay afloat and will be easier for rescuers to find.
The hazards of swimming in rivers were illustrated by the drowning of two teenage youths. A young girl, who had been swimming with the boys, said that one went to the middle of the river and the other to the opposite side. The youth in midstream began calling for help but the girl, thinking he was fooling, left the water and walked along the bank. When she returned both boys had disappeared. Still thinking she was being teased, the girl did not call help until more than an hour had passed.


Watch River Snags
When you swim in rivers, creeks and streams, first look for underwater snares—snags, logs, branches, boulders, or thick weed growth. They can be fatal traps. The old swimming hole can never be taken for granted; rivers change all the time and quickly. The place that was safe yesterday can be dangerous today.
Everyone with his own safety and the safety of his loved ones at heart will want to learn more about water safety. Booklets about water safety and safety in small boats can be obtained free of charge by writing to the National Water Safety Committee, Department of Internal Affairs, Private Bag, Wellington. The Committee will also send a free leaflet about rescue breathing, the simplest and most effective method of reviving people who have apparently drowned, to those who ask for it.

Marama Paewai, who writes here about her experiences as an American Field Scholar, is one of a number of Maori secondary school pupils who, along with pakeha pupils, have spent a year studying in American schools. Two others who have visited America under the scheme recently are Ngapera Kaa of Te Kaha, and Timothy Te Heu Heu, whose photograph is on the next page.


My Year as an
American School Girl
by Marama Paewai

Ten months at High School in Des Moines, Iowa, a month-long tour of the Eastern States, and a long vacation in Sausalito, California, all add up to the most wonderful experience a school girl of seventeen could have.
I left Hukarere Maori Girls' School in August 1961, and took this trip under the auspices of the American Field Service Exchange Programme.
I visited many places, and the two traits of the American people that impressed me most were firstly, their great and unselfish hospitality, and secondly, the students' awareness of life. They seem to realize that there is a future to be prepared for, politically, economically and socially. As teenagers in a democracy, they are remarkably aware of the workings of their government and recognize their rights to the full.

Relaxed Atmosphere at School
Socially, the American teenager has loads of fun—the ball games, the cheering squads, the drive-in movies, the many parties, the bowling alleys, and the school proms.
School life at Theodore Roosevelt High, a co-educational school with two thousand students, is a phase of life which I miss very much. The students there enjoy a very relaxed relationship with their teachers, and the absence of uniform creates a casual atmosphere in the school. However, I never did decide whether or not I favoured this attitude. My studies there included English, American Literature, American Government and Economics, Latin and Biology. Languages and all fields of science seemed to be the subjects most stressed.
The big city life, which we hear so much about, really exists. Chicago and Los Angeles are big, industrial, and therefore dirty cities, but New York and San Francisco impressed me as being




Marama Paewai loved her year in America—but she's glad to be home again.

tremendously big, beautiful, clean and exciting cities.

Family life, which is stressed a great deal, taught me many things. The home of Mr Roger Johnson, in which I lived as a daughter, was run on love and consideration. I will not say that the children were not more demanding than we seem to be, but very enveloping love and respect were always foremost.


Visit to President Kennedy
On the 24th of June, thirty-three A.F.S. students, including myself, left Iowa for a month's tour of the Eastern States, staying with families in the various communities. The highlights for all, I think, were New York city, the United Nations, and a visit to the White House where we met President Kennedy. I will always fondly remember the company during this time of European, Latin American, and South East Asian students.
After a month in San Francisco, during which I lived with an outstanding Negro family, I turned towards Aotearoa, and that was the most wonderful part of it all.
I can only thank sincerely, all those who helped me in any way for this wonderful year, and wish that in future years the number of young Maori people who receive this scholarship will increase.

Field Scholar
in America





Timothy Morehu Te Heuheu, a son of Hepi Te Heu Heu and a pupil at St Patrick's College, is at present staying at Buffalo City, 20 miles from Niagara Falls, as one of this year's Field Scholars. When he comes back next year he hopes to study law at Victoria University.



Maori Soldiers Sing
Malayan Songs

A Maori record with a difference has just appeared under the Kiwi label. Called ‘Maori Soldiers Sing Melodies of Malaya’, it is the third release from the Concert Party of the Second Battalion the New Zealand Regiment. (The other two are ‘The Coming of the Maori’ and ‘Maori Soldiers Abroad’.) All royalties from the record have been donated to the Maori Education Foundation.
One of the party's visits to the Malayan capital, Kuala Lumpur, coincided with ‘Bulan Bahasa Kebangsa'an’—a special month-long promotion by the Malayans to encourage all members of their multi-racial country to speak Malay, which is the national language. ‘Bulan Bahasa’ is an annual event which is very important in Malaya. At the request of the New Zealand High Commissioner, Mr C. M. Bennett, D.S.O., the officer in charge of the party took several popular songs and gave them Maori words (and in one case, actions) and also wrote verses in Malay telling of the party and its work.
The soldiers' performance of these Malay songs was an immediate hit; in a special farewell article to the Battalion, the newspaper the ‘Malay Mail’ expressed this when it said that ‘by singing popular Malay songs and by their friendly ways they have won the confidence of Malayans and helped foster closer understanding between the two countries’.
When the party came back to New Zealand their Malayan songs pleased audiences here too, and this prompted ‘Maori Soldiers Sing Melodies of Malaya’.







During the Coronation Ceremonies at Ngaruawahia this October (see page 30 of this issue), the son of Princess Piki Paki, and grandson of King Koroki, was baptised by the Rev. G. I. Laurenson (seen here holding the child).
The child was named Maharaia Piki Paki, in memory of the late Maharaia Winiata, who was closely associated with the King Movement.

It's an impressive sight to see an entire meeting-house travelling down the road, as this one at the Upoko-Tataia pa in the Taupo district did recently. Like many meeting-houses, it had become rather isolated when the community shifted nearer to town. So the owners of the house have moved the whole building three miles down the road to Papakai, where it will be more central and able to be used more. When Peter Blank took this photo it was about to take off on its travels—the first time, we are told, that Ngati Tuwharetoa have shifted an entire meeting-house this way.


This group performing a powhiri for Lord and Lady Freyberg are in the Guildhall in London, a famous historic building which is certainly a novel background for Maori action songs. The people in the group are, left to right: front row, Luie Tawhai (from Rotorua), Margaret Moore (nee Paiki, Christchurch), Norma Morehu (Otaki), Winnie Waapu (Hastings); second row: Sam Karetu (Hastings), Cini Boynton (Waimana), Mary Peni (Pipiwai), Margaret Smith (Kohukohu), Tom Russell (Hastings). One member of the group, Ben Wanoa from Tokomaru Bay, wasn't able to be present on this occasion.
The photo was sent to us by Mr Sam Karetu, the Information Officer at New Zealand House in London, who promises to keep us in touch with Maori activities in London. He says that he knows of at least 32 Maori residents in London at the moment, all of them enjoying it very much. They have formed an amateur group called the Aotearoa Maori Entertainers and have found that action songs, poi and haka are very popular with English audiences. Not everyone who would like to belong can get to practices, though, because many are nurses on night duty.

Hostel Luxury at Freezing Works
photographed by Ans Westra
Perhaps it is a bit much to describe any hostel as being luxurious, exactly, but the boys in the hostel at the Gear Meat Works, Petone, are certainly pretty comfortable.
They have individual, well-planned rooms of their own (some of them going in for some pretty striking forms of interior decoration), and their communal rooms include a kitchen where they make themselves supper, an all-purpose room used for such things as practices by the hostel band, and a sitting-room complete with ping-pong tables, TV, and comfortable armchairs. There is also a football field where flood-lit games can be seen going on most evenings.

Boys Feel Responsible
Much of this comfort is due to the Company's concern for their welfare, but the big thing is that the boys have been led to feel responsible for the place, and, as a consequence, to be proud of it. They have been encouraged to acquire the facilities for many spare-time activities, but they have mostly raised the money for these things themselves; the TV and their expensive band instruments, for example, were paid for through their own fund-raising efforts. They know that they could ask the Company for money—but they take a pride in being independent. This pride is surely the reason for the spotless condition in which things are kept, and for the happy atmosphere there.
During the peak season at the works there are up to 80 boys, nearly all of them Maori, living at the hostel, and even in the off-season there are about sixty of them. Nearly all of them are under 21 (after this, if they're not married they usually share a house with friends), and they come from all over New Zealand—from Waikato, Northland, Taranki, the East Coast, Wellington itself, and elsewhere.
They get on very well at the Gear Meat Works, where 45 per cent of all the workers are Maoris; ‘we really welcome Maoris here,’ Mr Steve Watene, the Company's Welfare Officer, told ‘Te Ao Hou’. Maoris have a natural aptitude for the work, he said; provided a company looks after them, they are exceptionally good workers.


Good With Their Hands
Mr Watene, who has been Welfare Officer at the Company for six years, told us many interesting things about Maoris in freezing works. They manage well because they are particularly good at using their hands, and enjoy doing so; this capacity to enjoy their work, especially when they are in groups (a capacity which in general is probably more typical of

Maoris than Pakehas), makes all the difference.
Though they get on well with their Pakeha mates, they prefer on the whole to work in all Maori groups. They don't like detailed work, such as meat processing jobs, but are very good at the heavy work, like butchering and dressing. The expert teams of ‘tally men’ are 90 per cent Maori, simply because Maoris are usually better at this work than Pakehas. (Maoris don't like the cold, though, it seems; there are few of them in the freezing chambers, even though the pay is good there).
In the last few years, Maori workers have been especially encouraged to take on responsible positions, and at present three out of fifteen supervisors are Maori, with seven more training for the job.
This is quite different from the situation a few years ago, when Maoris had responsible jobs at the Works, and when things did not always go smoothly as regards the Maori employees there. The change in atmosphere which has occurred since then is due to a new management's intelligent interest in the welfare of their employees; one aspect of this is the especial attention which they have paid to Maori welfare, both as regards the hostel and in other respects.
Much of the credit is certainly due to Mr Watene, who came to the Company in the first instance simply as its Welfare Officer, and only by chance found himself concentrating upon Maori problems. Mr Watene, who comes from Auckland (he used to be with Hellaby's there) has done a great deal to improve the situation at the Works.
The Company is certainly benefiting from their new policy also; there hasn't been a single work stoppage at the Gear Meat Works in the past four years—and this is a pretty notable record.

Gisborne's
Maori Competitions
by Leo Fowler

At the beginning of this September the Annual Maori Competitions were held before a capacity audience in the Opera House, Gisborne, for the eleventh year in succession. Some of those who had been six, seven and eight-year-olds in the Primary section when the competitions were first held were, this year, star performers in the front row of the Seniors.
To begin with, the Competitions were between teams representing parishes or maraes. The winner of one year's Aggregate Shield became the hosts for next year. They were responsible for organising the Competitions and they took the profit which was made.

Change of Organisation
Four years ago the representatives of various teams got together, and, under the lead of some of the more successful teams, decided to put the management of the Competitions under a Central Committee composed of delegates from each performing team. This move was greeted with some misgivings at the start but it has proved very successful. The winning team in gaining the highest number of points, now receives nothing more than the mana which accompanies the Kariatiana Tamararo Shield. But every team, whatever its standard, receives a mileage allowance of 2/- a mile, toward the expense of running buses. With the district now spreading from Waiapu in the North to Maungahaumi in the West and to Wairoa in the South, hiring buses can be an extremely heavy burden. A mileage cheque for £30 to £40 can make all the difference between a team's being able to compete and its having, reluctantly to decide to stay at home.

The quickness of the hand deceives the camera: the Mangatu Juniors performing at Gisborne this year


This year, for the first time, new teams were able to hire piu-pius from the Central Committee at the rate of 1/- a piu-piu for Seniors, sixpence for Juniors and threepence for Primaries. This is opening the door to many young teams who have so far been unable to raise funds to buy their own and have been diffident about borrowing them. The Central Committee were fortunate in getting a pound-for-pound subsidy from the Maori Purposes Fund Board for the purchase of their piu-pius.


Held On Their Own
The Competitions differ from others of their kind only in the fact that they are held in their own right. They are not an associate part of a hui or church gathering, but are held purely for the purpose of keeping alive this aspect of Maori Culture in the area.
There are no paid officers; everyone who works does so in a voluntary capacity. The Central Committee does not undertake billeting but a meal is provided for distant teams on arrival and there is a supper for teams and supporters at Poho-o-Rawiri Marae after the concert on the final night. All expenses are borne by the Committee.


High Standard Maintained
There is seldom much left in its bank account after the expenses and mileage grants are paid, but everyone concerned has had the satisfaction of seeing a high standard of haka competition being maintained for yet another year. The East Coast districts have a very wide reputation for this class of Maori Culture and it is undoubtedly true that the incentive offered by these Annual Maori Competitions has played a part in keeping interest so much alive in the wide district from which the competing teams come.

Annual
Celebrations at
Ngaruawahia

This year the five thousand people who came to the annual Coronation Celebrations at Ngaruawahia weren't too lucky in the weather; it rained a lot over the weekend, and plenty of people got pretty wet. But as usual at Ngaruawahia, the organisation went like clockwork, and everyone enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
On the next few pages we publish photographs of some of the people who were there; like most of the pictures which have appeared in Te Ao Hou recently, these were taken by Miss Ans Westra, a young Dutch photographer who is preparing a book of photographs about the Maori people.
The picture on the opposite page shows the religious service of thanksgiving. Like the early morning Raising of the Flag, this took place on the Monday, when the cultural and sporting events of the weekend were over, and most of the young people were back at school or at work, leaving the older people gathered for the annual ceremonies and discussions.
King Koroki, to whom the many speakers paid tribute, is one of the people in this photograph, being seated just past the centre post of the verandah. This day was the twenty-ninth anniversary of his coronation as the ruling head of the Tainui tribes—twenty-nine years which have seen many changes, but which have in no way affected the very widespread loyalty to the King Movement. In fact it is noticeable that at each October there are more and more people coming to Ngaruawahia from parts of the country which have not been associated with the King Movement in the past. Many of these people come as visitors rather than as actual adherents of the Movement—but either way, the popularity and success of Ngaruawahia gatherings such as this, show what a very considerable part Turangawaewae plays in Maori life today.
The teams entered in the cultural competitions provide one striking example of this, coming as they did from all over New Zealand.

Kumaras
and
Kumara
Magic
This stone carving is one of the religious statues usually known as ‘kumara gods’; it represented Rongo, the god who personified and protected kumaras, and the days of the old Maori religions it was placed with great ceremony beside the field of growing plants so that it would care for them. This particular statue is now in the Wanganui Museum, you will find other ones in other museums, though there are not very many of them; probably a lot were buried in the ground for safe-keeping in time of danger, and were lost when their owners didn't come back to collect them. We have photographed this figure standing in a little kit of kiwi feathers. This kit is not an old one, so it should not be regarded as being strictly authentic. But is is known that on important occasions Maoris decorated their sacred carvings with feathers, so probably it once did look something like this. It would almost certainly be painted with red ochre as well.

In most parts of New Zealand kumaras were Maoris' most important food; certainly they were their most important cultivated crop. Because of this, kumara growing, even more perhaps than fishing, was a very sacred undertaking, involving many solemn rituals.
When the first long whistling notes of the pipiwharauroa, the shining cuckoo, were heard in the spring, and when the stars showed that the right time had come, the ground was made ready for the kumara. Light, warm sandy soil suits kumaras best, and when the soil was heavy, women and slaves used to carry hundreds of baskets of gravel and sand to lighten it.
If much land was to be planted, the men all around would form a working party to dig the ground—perhaps twenty or thirty or forty men, all keeping time as they dug, swinging their ko rhythmically from side to side and singing an ancient chant. Often they ornamented their heads and the tops of their ko with feathers, and sometimes they hung aurei, the white crescent-shaped mat-pins of bone, from the tops of the ko; these clattered together as they dug, making a pleasant sound. Behind them came other men who heaped the soil into mounds.

Fields Were Tapu
The field where the kumaras were to grow had to be made tapu; as part of this ceremony, and usually before the kumaras were planted, long poles were brought and placed upright around the field. These poles represented the gods connected with the cultivation of the kumara—gods such as Rongo, Maui, Kahukura and Marihaka. Sometimes the people put the dried heads of famous ancestors upon the tops of these poles, and sometimes they brought other bones of their ancestors also, painted with red ochre and ornamented with feathers. These were put to watch over the fields so that their mana might ensure food for their descendants.
Sometimes stone statues, such as the one which we illustrate, were also brought to guard the fields. These seem usually to have represented Rongo, the chief of the gods associated with agriculture, but some statues had other names. Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua, for instance, was a very tapu island, largely because of the presence of the ancient statue called Matuatonga, which is still there today. Kumaras grew very well on Mokoia, and this was attributed to the great powers of Matuatonga. Because of this, each year before the planting began the tohungas from the surrounding districts would bring their seed-kumara to the island so that they could touch the figure of Matuatonga, thereby gaining its mana.


Ritual of Planting
The day on which the field was planted was very sacred. The planters arrived at the field before sunrise, and the tohunga chanted a prayer to Rongo, while they all faced towards the rising sun. Then the priest took a sacred basket of kumara and planted them, with ritual gestures, in a specially tapu part of the field. After this the men planted the rest of the field. When the work was over they ate a ceremonial meal of kumara from two sacred ovens; this was part of the ritual of removing the tapu which rested upon them during the planting.
While the plants were growing it was forbidden for strangers to approach them; if, in travelling across the country, you accidentally stumbled across the other tribe's kumara plantations, you were very likely to be attacked. During the summer the only people allowed near the kumara were the workman who did the weeding.
When the stars showed that the time had come to harvest the kumara, there were once again elaborate ceremonies performed by the tohunga, and once again the men working the fields (no women were allowed) were in a tapu condition. After all crop was lifted, and after ceremonial offerings of kumara had been made to the gods and all the necessary rituals were performed, it was the time of year for going visiting: a time when neighbouring friendly tribes entertained each other with elaborate feasts, when kumara and fish were displayed in great piles on tall platforms, and there were speeches, games, dancing, singing and festivity.


Readers interested in the nature and significance of the ceremonies by which the tohunga ensured fertility for the fields will find an authoritative and very interesting discussion of this in J. P. Johansen's ‘Studies in Maori Rites and Myths’ (1958).
Over the page we publish one of the many different stories which tell how the kumara first reached New Zealand.

This carving in a meeting-house at Manutuke, near Gisborne, depicts the bird on whose back Pourangahua flew to Aotearoa.


How the Kumara
Came to Aotearoa

Pourangahua was a man who lived on the east coast of the North Island, near where the town of Gisborne now stands. He and his wife had a small son whom they loved very much.
Now when this child grew big enough to run about, they noticed something very strange. Their son kept on poking out his tongue, and he did this always in the same direction, toward the sea. If he was walking along he would turn around and poke it out; if he was lying down he would roll over and do so.
Pourangahua and his wife asked themselves what this could mean. They thought of many things, but in the end Pourangahua said, ‘Perhaps our son is hungry’, and his wife agreed that this must be so. Then the two of them brought the child great quantities of the best food they could find: fernroot and berries, fish, eels, pigeons and tuis. But it was no use; still he continued to poke his tongue in the direction of the sea.
Then Pourangahua said, ‘The food for which our son hungers must be across the sea. I will go in my canoe to find it’. So he said farewell to his wife and son, and paddled out into the vast ocean. For many days he travelled, and saw no land. Then at last he reached an island. The people on this island made him welcome and took him to their village. There they set before him a strange food. Porangahua ate this, and found that it was much better than any food he had ever tasted. It was the kumara, which was not grown in his own land. Then Pourangahua knew that it was the Kumara for which his son had been hungry.
Pourangahua stayed for some time on the island as a guest of that people and their priest Tane. But after a while he became homesick, and wished to go again to his own country. However his canoe had disappeared, and there was no way for him to return.
Tane saw that his friend was sad, and asked

him the cause of this. When Pourangahua had told him, Tane said, ‘There is a way for you to go. But it is very dangerous; only the bravest of men could attempt it. If you wish to return to your own land, I will lend you my bird; you must sit upon its back, and it will carry you across the ocean’.
This bird was a pet of Tane's, a fierce and beautiful creature with huge wings.
‘And there is yet more danger’, Tane said. ‘After a time you will come to a mountain called Hikurangi. On this mountain there lives the monster Tama, and as you fly past him he will attack you. Therefore you must go past as the sun is setting. At this time of day the level rays of the sun will blind his eyes, so that he will not be able to see you, and you will escape his clutches.
‘There are, as well, two conditions which I will require of you if you borrow my bird. You must treat him with kindness, and you must alight from his back as soon as you reach your country. Otherwise he will not be able to return past the monster at the time when it is safe to do so’.
Pourangahua promised Tane that he would abide by these conditions, and he climbed on to the bird's huge back. He took with him a basket of kumaras, so that he might grow this wonderful food in his own land.
Then the bird clapped its great wings and rose in the air. It flew fast and high above the ocean until it came to the mountain where the monster Tama lived. Then the monster reached out to catch and devour them, but the sun was almost setting, and its rays came straight across the water and blinded Tama's eyes, and thus they escaped this peril.
At last Pourangahua saw in the distance the hills of his home. But then he forgot the two promises he had made to Tane. He had said he would treat the bird with kindness, but now he reached out and pulled a long feather from its back. This feather sank down through the water beneath them, and at the bottom of the ocean it grew into a tall spreading tree; but that is another story. Pourangahua had also promised that he would alight from the bird as soon as they came to his country. But now he was so eager to see his wife and son again that he forgot this, and made the bird take him all the way to his own village. Because of this, by the time the bird flew back it was the middle of the day. At this time the monster's eyes were not blinded by the sun, and as the bird came past him, he seized and devoured it.
When he heard of the fate of his bird, the priest Tane through his magic sent across the sea the three diseases which attack the kumara. So it is because of Pourangahua that the Maori people have the kumara, but it is because of Pourangahua's unkindness that they must work so hard to cultivate it, and it does not always flourish.

When a 20-year-old Auckland Maori shoe-making apprentice won the £12,000 first prize in the Golden Kiwi a few months ago, he sought to buy a house for his wife and himself. When the youth pleasant, presentable and well-dressed, told a group housing salesman he wanted something about £4,000 and would pay cash, the salesman laughed—and lost a sale.
After buying a house from a vendor who took him seriously, the youth sought to buy furniture for it from a leading city furniture store. The salesman showed him only junk, would not listen when told the customer wanted quality—and lost a three-figure order.

Mr F. B. Katene has recently retired from his position as District Welfare Officer for the Ikaroa district, an extensive district which extends from Cook's Strait South to the Manawatu, Wairarapa, Wellington and Hawkes Bay. He served four years overseas in active service during World War I, worked for a time as Land Agent in Wellington, then in the New Zealand Railways till 1940. Since then he has been with the Maori Affairs Department for a period of 22 years.
In Wellington Mr Katene is better known as ‘Uncle Fred’, perhaps a phrase that explains the virtues of this sympathetic, kindly and quiet gentleman. His work has not been a job to him, but a life's work of sheer devotion to the needs of the Maori people and the mission of racial harmony on a personal and group level.
Without men like Fred Katene, the Ngati Poneke Association would not be the respected and vigorous organisation that it is today. There have been many times when I felt Mr Katene was the Ngati-Poneke Association.
Like all men in ‘needle’ positions he has been subject to frequent criticism, many destructive, but with a smile and a shrug he has carried on his merry way, with continued success. Wherever there is ‘dirty’ work to be done during or after social gatherings, there you will find ‘Uncle Fred’—keeping things going and planning behind the scenes.
In his daily Welfare duties he has always been energetic and persistent. Where-ever he is—and usually he is there, whether it be the Magistrate's Court, conferences, tribal meetings, youth gatherings or church meetings—‘Uncle Fred’ stands out as a distinctive and alert personality.
His retiring from the ‘old school’ of Welfare Officers means the passing of an era—his day was not the day of the trained social scientist, but a time when success depended more on an officer's personality, personal sacrifices, devotion and sheer ‘guts’.

Two More
Very Successful
Leadership Conferences

should women be allowed to speak on the marae? Do boarding schools produce prominent Maori leaders, and if so, why? Should Maori be taught in all New Zealand primary schools? How can extra coaching with school homework be made most effective? Should Maoris and Pakehas see more of each other socially, and how can this be brought about? What new qualities are required in Maori leaders today?
Two very successful Young Leadership Conferences have been discussing these questions, and a hundred others, with much animation recently.
At Tauranga a Conference last September was attended by 150 people from a wide area, and five discussion groups exchanged ideas on education, health, housing and employment. It was this Conference, too, that the much-debated question, ‘should women be able to speak on maraes?’ was raised. In some parts of the country they have done so for hundreds of years; in other parts, particularly in the Arawa district, they are never allowed to do this. There was much passionate oratory on this subject, especially from the Arawa men present. After the voting on the question had twice been disputed, tradition finally won by 29 votes to 27.

Second Ruatoria Conference
There was also a Conference at Ruatoria at Labour Weekend. There had been one Conference there earlier this year, in May. This was so successful that committees were set up which studied specific topics raised at that time, and presented the results of their researches at this second conference. In the first conference the chief subject discussed was education; in the second, by a natural progression, the emphasis was on employment.

Off to Hawaiki?

We took this photograph of Mr Mark Metekingi when he came into Te Ao Hou's office recently to talk about the canoe voyage which he hopes to make back in the direction of Hawaiki, the Homeland of the Maori.
We mention this fact because a background of filing cabinets and office paraphernalia isn't really a very suitable one for a man with such very outdoor ambitions.
Department (to find out the regulations concerning Mr Metekingi had just been to see the Marine small craft on ocean voyages), the Forestry Department (to enquire about trees for the canoe), the National Publicity Department, and several other Government Departments. He said he was very encouraged by the interest his idea was causing, and that if finance (an estimated p5,000) can be obtained, and if the project receives the support of the Maori People, he is convinced that such a voyage would be practical and worthwhile.

Double-Hulled Canoe
The canoe is to be a double-hulled one, as were the canoes which originally came to New Zealand. There are still some people, he said, who have the knowledge to make canoes, and who know the correct karakia to recite in connection with this.
No-one knows exactly where Hawaiki is, but the immediate setting-off place is generally agreed to be Tahiti, and before this, perhaps, Hawaii. Hawaii has a special interest for Mr Metekingi because of the Polynesian Village which the Mormon Church is building there at present. He is a member of the Mormon faith, and would very much like to there for the opening of this Village next September.


Spirit of Adventure
Now he is looking for thirty men, Maoris for preference, who possess the necessary spirit of adventure for an expedition of this kind—‘I'm not interested in anyone who says it can't be done. The men I want must have a positive outlook and be prepared for some degree of hardship with cheerfulness and optimism.’ The vessel will have to carry radio, lifeboats, lifebelts and rafts, but apart from this he plans to make the conditions as traditional as possible. The main diet for all will be taro and kumera, and a quantity of dried fish and karaka berries will also be included.
‘As far as I'm concerned at the moment there will be nothing cooked on the voyage. Everything will be either dried or preserved and for the entire trip members of the expedition will be living on a spartan diet.’
Training would be required and much of it would have to be done in their own time. Self-discipline would be a basic requirement, because the early Maori voyagers were able to travel for long distances without water.
One other difficulty will be that the ocean winds are not nearly as favourable for a voyage from New Zealand to the Central Pacific, as they are for canoes coming in the other direction.
Mr Metekingi gives his reasons for the voyage as being sentimental, historical and scientific, and hopes to be able to make a start in a few months.



Sometimes it is pretty puzzling to find your way round a library. There are so many different sections for different sorts of books, that it is easy to miss books you would find interesting.
The Upper Hutt branch of the M.W.W.L. recently held a most successful ‘Library Night’ in their local library. The librarian, Mr I. W. Malcolm, showed them in an informal way how to join the library, how to take out books and how to find the books they wanted. He emphasized that librarians are very glad to help people find their way around.
Members of the League found the evening a most interesting one, and were impressed by the number of books on practical subjects, and also with the number of books on Maori subjects.
This ‘Library Night’ was so successful that a number of other branches of the League are thinking of following the example of the Upper Hutt group.

This is the second and last instalment of Mohi Turei's history of the famous Ngati Porou ancestor Tuwhakairiora. A slightly modified translation of this story appeared in the last June issue of Te Ao Hou.







Tuwhakairiora
na Mohi Turei
Ka mutu nga karakia katoa a Te Aotaki ka hoki raua; tae atu, kua rite nga kai ki runga i te takotoranga. Kainga i waho, ka whakaritea he tohunga hei whangai mo Tuwhakairiora. Ka mutu, ka tomo ki te whare. Ko te moenga o Ruataupare kei raro iho o te mataaho, ka tau ia ki te tuarongo moe ai, ka waiho te moenga mo Tuwhakairiora. Ko te koroua ra kei te taha o te ahi i te tara iti o te whare e mihimihi atu ana ki a ia. Ka roa, ka karanga atu ia ki a Ruataupare; ka whakatika mai hoki te tamahine, ka noho ki tona taha. Ka roa ka mutu hoki tona ngurunguru, katahi ka ki nui atu. ‘Whanatu ki raro i to tungane na, hei wharorotanga mai mo ona waewae.’ Ka whakatika a Ruataupare, ka moea a Tuwhakairiora, ka puta ia ki waho.
Ka ko nga kopara o te ata, ka karanga mai ki te tamahine kia tahuna te ahi. Ka ka, ka tomo ia, raua ko Hinemaurea ki te whare; katahi ano ia ka tangi ki a Tuwhakairiroa. Ka hi nga kawainga o te ata ka maoa te kai. Tera no te ahiahi ka kiia e ia kia hohoro he kai, kia ora ai nga tumau te takatu ki nga whakaeke apopo; koia i hohoro ai te maoa. Ka whangaitia ringa-ringatia hoki a Rautaupare e tetahi tohunga, me te manawareka a te iwi tiaki o te pa i te moenga a Ruataupare i a Tuwhakairiora.
Ka mutu te kai, ka ki ia kia hohoro he kai kia puta rawa ake ai, ka maoa. Morunga rawe ake te ra ka puta nga iwi i pohiritia ra; ana, me he tuarawharau ki te waha mai i nga ika tauraki kua maroke, i nga hapuku, i nga mango, i nga tawatawa, i nga maomao, i te tini noa iho o nga kai o te moana, nga mahinga a tera iwi nui tonu, a te Ngutuau, me nga iwi o te ngahere, o nga maunga, e mau mai ana i te hinu, me era atu kai.
Ka tau ki raro, kei te titiro a Tuwhakairiora ki te nui o Te Aotaki me tona iwi, ka mea ia i roto i a ia, ‘Ka tae au ki te mate o toku tipuna.’
Ka tu a Te Aotaki ki te mihi ki te iwi. Ka mutu, katahi ano ia ka whaikorero ki a Tuwhaka-iriora, me te patai ki te putake o tona haramai ko ia anake. Ka tu ia ki runga—kua oti ia te rakai ki nga tohu o te rangatira, o te toa. Tunga ki runga, ana! me te mea ka whati te taiaha i roto i nga ringa, wahi ke te rapa me te reke. E mihi ana ki te iwi, katahi ka utua te patai. ‘Taku haramai, ko te whakatauki a taku koka noku pea e takatakahi ana i roto i a ia, ka ki iho nei:—‘E i, kia takatakahi koe i roto i a au, he tane, E ea i a koe te mate o toku papa.’
Ka oho nga iwi, ko te mate o Poroumata te haramai a Tuwhakairiora, me te mihi ano ki ona rongo toa e hau mai ra, rite ki a ia e tu ra.
Ka mutu te kai, ka tonoa e Te Aotaki he karere ki nga pa ra, ki Puketapu, ki Kotare, ki Te Rangihuanoa, ki Tarapahure, ki Totaratawhiti, ki Okauwharetoa, me era atu pa ki te whakaatu ko Tuwharairiora he ngaki i te mate o tona tipuna. Ka riro te karere ra, ka ki ia, ‘Whakatika, mauria ta koutou kai, kia wawe taua te tau ki raro hei tumau mo te ope apopo ki Okauwharetoa.’
Te taenga atu o nga karere ra ka ki nga iwi o nga pa ra, ka kiia ‘Koia ano a Te Aotaki i wawahi ai i tona maunga, i Pukeamaru, ka kitea iho hoki e nga pa ra e haere ana i te one i Punaruku, i te akau o Karakatuwhero, me he pārāriki.’ Kei te tahere nga pa ra i te kai, i te hinu, me era atu kai. I te ata ka puta nga manomano o nga pa ra, ka wharona te kai, ka takoto nga matua, ia matua, ia matua, me nga matua hoki a Te Aotaki. Katahi ka werohia, ka ara he matua, ka takoto; ka werohia nga matua katoa, ka takoto tona tini. Kei mua a Tuwhaka-iriora i nga matua ra e titiro atu ana ki te rerenga mai o nga waewae o ia matua, o ia matua. Ka tohu atu ia ki te reke o tana taiaha, ara ki te arero. ‘Ko tera matua ki a au, ko tenei na, me tera ra, ko nga matua katoa me noho. Engari ko nga toa katoa me te kairakau o era matua me hui mai ki a au hai matua maku.’
Ka tu mai nga rangatira, ka karanga mai, ‘Kia nui, kia nui te Whare me te Tarahau, kia maru ai; ko te iwi tena, ko Ngati Ruanuku, me nga hapu nunui, a Hore, a Mana, a Te Pananehu, a Te Koreke, Te Mokowhakahoihoi, a Te Pohoumauma.’ Pera tonu hoki te tohu a Te Aotaki, ‘Kia nui te Whare me te Tarahua, kia maru ai, ko te tini tena o makihoi, a te para-kiore, o te rororo, ona whakatauki.’ Katahi a Tuwhawakairiora ka tohu, ‘Kati, kati i aku e tohu atu nei.

Maori Action Songs: The Putiki Maori Club


Kiwi M3D-1 7in. 45 E.P.


Both records reviewed in this issue have been on sale for some time. They are presented by two of the best Maori groups in the country.
‘Maori Action Songs’ is an unpretentious little record which makes very pleasant listening. Because it was originally designed merely to illustrate a number of action songs featured in a book which was subsequently published, the record does not really show the versatility and brilliance of the Putiki group to the best advantage. But there is little fault to find in what is essentially a competent presentation of straight action songs. Understandably, they are refreshingly free of the jazzing-up which seems almost compulsory in many of the Maori discs which have appeared recently. ‘Kuarongorongo’ and ‘Te Ope Tuatahi’ have not been recorded for some years, and make a welcome appearance in this record.

Songs of Enchantment: St. Joseph's Maori Girls' College Choir


Viking VP52 12in 33 1/3 L.P.

‘Songs of Enchantment’ will similarly please any who purchase it. The technical quality of the recording is very good indeed, and this is matched by the clarity of diction and pleasing harmony of the performers. A numbers of old chestnuts such as ‘Po Atarau’ and ‘Pokarekare’ are given an airing along with several items which, as far as I know, have not previously been recorded, such as ‘Maranga Mai’, ‘Kumea’ and others. It is a shame, though, that on a record of such a generally high standard, there are some uneven patches. ‘Po Atarau’ for example gets away to a very shaky start and there is a tendency towards stridency in some of the items. ‘Karu’ would be greatly improved by a variation in volume and emphasis to achieve some light and shade.
I do wish producers of records would realise that the reverse side of the cover can be put to better use than advertising other records. A few notes on the items are always appreciated, especially by European listeners, and, forgive my ignorance, but just where is St Joseph's Maori Girls' College?* The cover of course does not detract from a very satisfying record but buyers would feel they were getting greater value for their money if there were just a little bit more on the cover.

Report of the
Commission on
Education in N.Z.
reviewed by John Booth

In 1960 the government set up a Commission of Enquiry to look into all aspects of education in New Zealand. After hearing the views of many different people and seeing for themselves what was being done in schools all over the country, the Commission has brought out a massive and most valuable report of over eight hundred pages.
Although the Department of Education acknowledges that there are many problems facing the 70,000 Maori children in New Zealand's schools, the Commission was not asked specifically to examine Maori education. Everywhere it looked, however, it saw that overhead above the ordinary difficulties facing every child and every school, Maori children and Maori schools had special difficulties that could only be overcome by making special provision for extra help, just as is done for other children who are handicapped in some way.
Some Maoris might be worried by the thought that more money should be spent on their children than on most Pakeha children. They do not want any special privileges. This, however, is not how the educational authorities look at the situation because it is their job to give equal opportunity to every child, no matter where he comes from, and to help him climb as high as he can up the hill of education. Some groups are going to cost more to educate than others but, whatever the cost, the country cannot afford to have the talents of a large section of the population going to waste.

Ways to Help
Realising the importance of Maori education, the Commission devotes a whole chapter to it in this Report. It makes it clear that there is a very great effort needed now by all concerned with the education of our Maori children. There are so many of them who have the ability to do well at school but who, for a variety of reasons, are not successful. There are so many who, because they have not been able to get the most out of their education, must always stay in jobs that make use of only half their intelligence. The Commission makes twenty-three recommendations in connection with Maori education, all of which, it thinks, will help your children in one way or another.
While the report deals with the problems of teaching Maori, of providing scholarships big enough to meet the cost of boarding-schools, of meeting the needs of the pre-school child, most attention will probably be focused on the suggestion that the Department of Education should aim at handing over all Maori schools to Education Board control within the next ten years. At first sight this looks as if it will be a most unpopular suggestion. We all know how proud many settlements are of their Maori schools and how strongly they have opposed this change in the past. What the report proposes, however, is going to give far more than it takes away and deserves careful thought on the part of all Maori parents.
At the present time only one-child of the Maori children at primary schools attend the Maori schools which are administered by the Department of Education. The other two-thirds attend schools run by Education Boards, even though some of them have only Maori children on their rolls. The Commission proposes that all schools with more than a certain proportion of Maori children should be classed as ‘Maori Service’ schools, being given special assistance on a higher scale than Maori schools receive at present. These Maori Service schools would have extra money for library books, extra teachers to help children overcome reading difficulties and other specialists to guide the pupils in their school work and to advise parents how to help their children. This would apply to secondary schools as well as to primary.


‘A Special Need’
Probably some people will say that Maoris should be content with the same education that is available to everyone else. This is a shallow argument that supposes all children to be the same. What the schools try to do is to provide the very best education for all children, whether they are bright, dull or only average, whether they are blind, in hospital or perfectly healthy, whether they are Islanders, Pakehas or Maoris. The Commission says this, ‘that Maori education must become an area of special need, requiring special measures and, inevitably, increased expenditure. It (the Commission) believes that the Maori has as good a right to claim this from our community as have any other groups where children are handicapped through no fault of their own….’
The recognition of this special need is a good starting point. Not everyone will agree with the Commission's next step, the replacement of Maori schools under the Education Department with Maori Service schools under the Boards. In the writer's view, however, the gains should be far greater than the losses and should result in a far better educational deal for Maori children than they get at present.

‘New Zealand in Colour’, Vols. I & II
A. H. & A. W. Reed, each vol. 25s.
These big twin volumes contain well-printed colour photographs of New Zealand scenery, mostly beaches and lakes. Apart from a few distant views of holiday-makers, and one photo of some birds, almost the only sign of life they show is some of the Waihirere Maori Club, in Maori costume needless to say, performing in front of Poho o Rawiri in Gisborne. ‘New Zealand Scenery’ might have been a more accurate title; but certainly the photographs are very handsome.


Tales of Tamati
by Ian MacKay
Oswald Sealy Ltd., 18s.
These are home-spun, whimsical tales, of a rather old-fashioned kind; many readers will find them attractive, though other readers may get rather irritated at them.
They are ‘Maori’ stories, but Mr MacKay tells us that he has intermingled a considerable amount of fiction of his own invention. He also says that the tales are presented in a manner similar to that adopted by a Maori story-teller. This is a matter which readers will have to judge for themselves; of course, not all Maori story-tellers adopt the same manner.


The Dead Men of Eden
by V. Merle Grayland
Whitcombe & Tombs 12/6
The Eden in this detective novel is a new suburb being built on the outskirts of Auckland. There are quite a few dead men strewn around before the mysterious strangler is discovered, and the amateur sleuth who works it all out is a Maori, Hoani Mata.
Hoani isn't really keen on corpses, and likes an easy-going, enjoyable life better than an adventurous one. But no sooner does he come to Eden to help his brother Bob build a new house, than he finds sinister mysteries all around them. After a while he starts to put two and two together …
‘The Dead Men of Eden’ is unpretentiously written, but the background characters who live in this new suburb—young married couples trying to get a start, do-it-yourself experts, outdoor types, eccentrics and so on—are attractively presented and reasonably convincing; the same goes for Hoani and his brother. The book has humour as well as suspense, and it is interesting to read a detective story with a New Zealand setting. Altogether this is pleasant, easy reading.

From East Cape to Cape Egmont
by A. H. Reed
A. H. & A. W. Reed, 21s.
At 85 years of age A. H. Reed undertook a walk from New Zealand's extreme north to extreme south, writing a book about his travels called ‘From North Cape to Bluff’. Now he has made another expedition—from Te Araroa to Egmont, across the widest part of New Zealand. ‘From East Cape to Cape Egmont’ is an attractive account of some of the people, many of them Maori, whom he met on this long trek.





When Bishop Panapa re-dedicated the Poho o Kahungunu meeting house at Porangahau recently, he had a few sharp comments to make about education.
If he were Prime Minister of New Zealand, he told the large gathering, he would make a law against Maori mothers who take their sons out of school at the age of 15 and place them with shearing gangs. Any mother who did so, he said, ‘should be shot’. The Maori race was breeding like rabbits, but there was nothing wrong with that.
‘The thing is that we are a growing nation and combined with our European brothers what we need is education—first, second and last.’

Learning through play: children in the new Play Centre at Tikitiki.








Our Tikitiki Play Centre
by Rona Haig

Secretary Tikitiki Play Centre


The suggestion of a Play Centre for Tiki Tiki was first discussed by the members of the Maori Women's Welfare League. Enquiries were made and Mrs Bickerton, Country Liaison Officer for the Auckland Play Centre Association addressed a most interested audience in September of last year, 1961. Following this, the District Nurse arranged for one or two evenings when films were shown on pre-school children and Play Centre work and people were able to discuss the idea and mull it over in their minds.
Eventually, it was decided to start. A small but very keen committee was formed to raise

money and get the centre started. It was decided to hold a dance to try to raise £50 for equipment. Everybody helped; there were raffles and stalls; donations were given and the catering was done by the mothers. After all expenses were paid, we found we could bank more than our target figure. The problem of a building was solved, temporarily at least, by the Headmaster of the Tiki Tiki Maori District High School, Mr H. Lambert, B.A., who offered us the use of an empty school house.


Making a Start
The Tiki Tiki Play Centre was opened for the first time in June with a roll of seven. There wasn't much equipment to start with, mainly painting, drawing, cutouts, a few painted tins and blocks for the sandpit, but the Supervisor, Mrs Mana Rangi, managed to keep the small group of children happily occupied. Today the centre is much better equipped and the roll has grown to fifteen which includes the only Pakeha pre-school child in the township. Mr A. Grey, who visited us from Auckland, commented on the happy, relaxed atmosphere and the progress of both the mothers and the children. We are now applying for affiliation and, if this goes through, we receive a grant of £50 from the Government for upkeep and still more equipment.
We owe much to Miss McIntosh, the District Nurse, who as Secretary has contacted the necessary people, acquired films, books, recordings and given the mothers an idea of what a Play Centre is and how it is run.






Special Section
for Education
This is the beginning of a regular feature on education which will appear in every issue of Te Ao Hou. It will include sections on pre-school, primary school and, we hope, post-primary school education. We invite contributions from readers who can tell us something about the ways in which their own communities are helping their children—with Play Centres, with homework schemes, and in many other ways.
In the next column we publish an article about Play Centres, where pre-school children learn, through play, so much that helps them on their way when they begin at school. There is great interest in Play Centres in Maori communities these days; Mr A. Grey, who is the Director of Supervisor Training in the Auckland Play Centres Association and a lecturer at the Auckland Teachers' College, tells us here just what Play Centres are, and how they can be started.





Play Centres in
Maori Communities
by A. Grey
Do children under five need pre-school experience? Do Maori children need pre-school experience? What kind of pre-school experience is best for children under five?
Every year sees more children attending a pre-school. So if we judge by numbers only, we get the answer to our first questions—yes, children under five do need pre-school experience. Do Maori children need this experience? Yes, being children, they naturally need it, like all other children do.
But what kind of pre-school for Maori children, any children? One kind of pre-school being developed with increasing swiftness throughout New Zealand is the Play Centre.

Widespread Interest
Play Centres have become full, affiliated members of the Play Centre Association in Maori communities at Kokohuia and Te Ahu Ahu and another is nearly ready for affiliation at Tikitiki. Others are under consideration at Pukepoto, Te Hapua, Oruawharo, Omaio Bay, Ruatoria, Waiomatatini, to mention just a few names.
Impetus was given in Northland earlier and has continued in its development under the hands of Mrs G. Andrews, Onerahi, Liaison Officer for the Northland Sub-Association of the Auckland Play Centres Association.
On the East Coast and Bay of Plenty the first moves came from Alison McIntosh, Health Nurse, Tikitiki, and from school teachers on the Coast at Rangitukia, Tikitiki, Ruatoria and other areas, in discussion with Mrs O. E. Bickerton, County Liaison Officer, Auckland Play Centres Association.
Then in May 1962 the Ruatoria Maori Leaders' Conference gave time to discussions on Play Centre. This was reinforced by a talk to interested groups in Gisborne, Ruatoria and Tikitiki, and still further by a tour of the Bay of Plenty and East Coast by the Director of Supervisor Training, Auckland Play Centres Association, Mr A. Grey and his family.
On a five-day tour they demonstrated, lectured,

FORESTRY
and working plans
In any business correct planning is important, and never more than for a long term enterprise. But when it deals with assets of the magnitude of New Zealand's forests, a well-considered plan is a first essential. The New Zealand Forest Service, for each forest under its care, prepares a Working Plan. It prescribes every operation for the life of the forest. And while it provides for continuity of management, it can be revised to incorporate new methods and techniques. The Forest Service maintains constant research to secure maximum yields per acre, a maximum use of wood from thinnings, and a maximum financial return. As with any other business, the management of timber crops is expected to be prudent and profitable. And this is the task of the New Zealand Forest Service.

discussed and organized Play Centre interest at Omaio Bay, Tikitiki, Ruatoria, Tokomaru Bay, Patutahi, Mangapapa, Whatatutu, Matawai, Maungatapu, and Matapihi.


Enthusiastic Parents
Play Centre has only one magical quality about it—the enthusiasm of parents for the welfare of their children. All the rest is sound common sense. Parents of pre-school aged children find a suitable local hall, meeting-house or house. The mothers and fathers make most of the equipment they need, from working drawings supplied by the Play Centre Association. They raise the money, from as little as £15 to as much as they can acquire. They discuss the basic Play Centre information contained in four booklets, or on long-playing gramophone or tape recordings. They bring forward three, four, five or six parents to qualify as Helpers; either one, two or three of these Helpers go on to qualify and become the holders of an Assistant's Certificate, and one or two to continue to qualify and become the holders of a full Supervisor's Certificate. An affiliated Play Centre runs for 20 children, two or three half days a week, under a parent who is fully trained and certificated for this age-group of children.


For Any Parents, Anywhere
Play Centre can be for any group of parents anywhere. It is for Maoris and pakehas. It is designed for children as a place where they can learn by playing with other children. It is designed for parents as a place where they can become the kinds of parents they want to be with their children. It is designed for the community as a place where adults co-operate in building a service for youth that leads on to the welfare of the citizens of tomorrow.

Out of seven New Zealand cadets who graduated from the Officer Cadet School at Portsea in Australia recently, the two highest placings were gained by Maoris.
They were Second Lieutenant A. R. Kiwi of Raurimu, who was third in a class of 43, and Second Lieutenant T. K. Tapuke of New Plymouth, who was sixth.
The Adjutant-General, Brigadier W. S. McKinnon, said that when the new officers returned to New Zealand, they will be posted to Waiouru for post-graduate training, and they will be attached to the National Military Unit for further experience.
Later, those in the Infantry Corps can expect to see service in Malaya.







Maori Education
Foundation Policy:
Two Categories

The work of the Maori Education Foundation will fall into two broad categories—helping the re-school child and assisting students already at school or university.
This was stated recently when the chairman of the foundation's board of trustees, Mr D. G. Ball, announced the policy of the board.
The board defined this under the headings of home and parents, pre-school education, primary education, post-primary education, university education, apprenticeships, adult education and research.
Mr Ball emphasised that applications for assistance at all levels of education would be considered.

Home and Parents
Under the heading of home and parents the board seeks active co-operation with all organisations which have influence with the Maori people. It will issue a pamphlet to inform Maori parents of vocational opportunities for their children, and the educational requirements for such vocations, and it will ask the Minister of Education to have a Maori teacher made liaison officer between the Maori Education Foundation, Maori District Council, district educational advancement committees and Maori communities.
It will also seek the help of the New Zealand Libraries Association and the National Library Service in a campaign to encourage reading among the Maori people.
The Maori Women's Welfare League will be asked to arrange for each branch to appoint a member as a local education publicity officer.
Under the heading of pre-school education the board will ask the New Zealand Free Kindergarten Union and the New Zealand Play Centre Federation to encourage the enrolment of Maori children, and it will help in setting up new play centres.
The Minister of Education will be asked for a suitable Maori teacher or kindergarten supervisor to work on strengthening the pre-school stage of the child's development, and to develop a type of play centre equipment that would be readily familiar to Maori children.

This is the first of a new series of articles on primary school children, which will describe some of the adventures children meet as they work their way up the school, and some of the ways in which you can help them to make these adventures successful. They are written by ‘Kaiwhakaako’, the young teacher whose article on education appeared in our June issue.

We invite you to send ‘Kaiwhakaako’ (c/o The Editor, Box 2390, Wellington), questions or problems concerning children at primary school. His answers will appear in each issue of Te Ao Hou.

AN)/£ N) XML)

What's all this nonsense? It's easy really, if you just say X for jump, N for apple,) for no, / for egg, £ for top … is that quite clear? Of course it isn't, it's anything but. Yet this is what printed words look like to your five year old, and this is the way, once upon a time, he used to be taught to read. You probably just guessed that they should be read from left to right, because that is the way you usually read—but a five-year-old doesn't know this—right to left, upside down, it's all the same to him.

‘Please Miss, Here's Sonny’
Let's think about this five-year-old for a moment, the one you took to school the other day, or sent along with his elder sister (she knocked on the Infant Mistress's door, said ‘Please Miss, this is my little brother Sonny—where's your hanky Sonny’—and took off at full speed to play with the other girls). You have taken care of him since he was born and he has learned to walk and talk, and has built up a list of things which, in a shadowy way, he knows something about; he knows he mustn't play with the fire, tease the baby; he has learnt quite a lot of things by listening, he may know both his names, his address, and how old he is, he may not have seen a fire-engine but he has heard of them.
Now here he is, handed over to a strange lady and thirty or forty other children all coming to look at him and ask him his name—it must be all very frightening. Sonny has come to school to learn to read. I hope you haven't been holding him up—some children still come to school scared out of their wits with stories about the teacher.


Before He Starts
Here are some ways you can help him to learn to read before he comes to school. It helps if he has had some picture book to look at, some simple toys to play with, and if he has had things explained to him. (Does your three or four-year-old ask ‘Why?’ all the time? If he doesn't he ought to.). Another useful thing is to take the new child along to school yourself two or three times before he actually starts; this helps him to get used to the idea that soon he will be going to stay there all day.
Read your children stories, or tell them about what things were like when you were small—or if you haven't got time for this, get one of the other children to get a book from the Infant Mistress to read the small ones (it helps to keep them quiet too). Use Kindergarten of the Air and the Children's Session on the radio, join the Infant Mother's Club or the P.T.A. If you possibly can, take Sonny to a Play Centre—you may find there's one near your home, perhaps one that's just being started, as many are these days.


In the ‘Standards’
After about two years in the Infant Department Sonny will go into Standard One. He has learned to read, is everything going to be plain sailing now?
In the Primer classes and the early Standards nearly all the child's time was spent in learning how to recognize words on a page, learning new words, and reading simple stories. Meanings were simple so that the stories could be read easily, and stories were told in a very few words, the words which any child who has learned English fairly well uses when he speaks—words such as come, little, see, dog, run, and so on.
Now Sonny learned his English (and, I hope, his Maori too) from you and the rest of the family; if your English is not very fluent then he has to learn his correct English somewhere else. Teachers help a little, but his main learning will come from reading and writing
You know, I can't think of any more important thing for a primary school child to do than read widely and well. Every day every one of us has to read something, whether it is for fun, to get information, or to keep ourselves alive! Put it this way—all the arithmetic we use we could learn

in about six months and we would probably never need to learn any more, not for every-day purposes, that is. But the kind of knowledge we get by reading, that goes on forever. History? Read a book. How people live in China? Read a book. How to grow pumpkins? Read a book. How to build a house, bake a cake, travel from Auckland to Wellington? Read a book. To understand more about ourselves and other people? Read books, books, and more books!
Do you see why I think reading is so important? Very well. But to do all these things the school has to have a very carefully worked out programme. Teachers are very conscious of this and all the time they are trying to keep up with new ideas about teaching children to read. At an evening course in Auckland recently, more than eight hundred teachers attended each night.
Every class has an important part to play in the reading programme but in general the upper Standards are trying to do two things. They are trying to keep children's interest in reading high (they have to compete against radio, T.V. and pictures to do this), and they are trying to help children to find out the meaning of what they read.


How to Help
Now, what can you do to help? If you live in town you can make sure that your child is a member of the children's section of the public library. This usually costs a small fee, but borrowing is free. Standard three or even earlier is about the right time for this. Make sure that the children borrow regularly and return their books on time. In the country, enquire from the school about library services.
The National Library Service (God bless them) supply all the schools with an issue of books each year. Some schools allow the children to take these home (please see that they are returned, the school has to pay for lost books), but a book from the school library once every couple of weeks is really not enough for a child in Standard Four or higher. Most children in my class read three or more books in a week! Have a look at the books your children bring home; you will probably find that you can get some fun out of them too.


Time Well Spent
Reading takes time. I know that it is a temptation to get Sonny to go out and chop some more wood, or his sister to go and give the baby its bottle. These jobs are important; children should help in the house. But reading is important too, and I don't think it will do any harm if, after tea, you turn off the radio for half an hour or so and say, ‘Sit down and read a book’. They will be getting something from it, and so will you.
Well, there's my case in favour of reading. As a school teacher I think that learning to read is important, but not half as important as what comes from reading. Reading is a little like eating. You have to vary things a bit—fish and chips is all right now and then, but not every day of the week. A comic may do to fill in half an hour, but comics shouldn't be the only things that your boy or girl reads; they don't let them learn nearly enough about the things they need to know, things reading can tell them.
The school's part was to start your children off in reading; your part is to see that they get the food their minds should have, and don't have to go hungry.



The Minister of Transport, Mr McAlpine, says that he is concerned at the number of Maoris killed on the roads each year.
‘Last year 64 were killed, nearly three times the rate of Europeans on a percentage basis.
‘That is the known number. With European names so common among Maoris, accidents involving Maoris are not necessarily reported to us as such. It's a pretty frightening picture.’
The Maori usually was a skilful driver, as he had proved during the war and as drivers of bulldozers. But let loose on the highway he was in many cases a menace to himself and others. He was too happy-go-lucky and seemed to drive a little more dangerously than other people.

Auckland has now a metropolitan Maori choir.
The Maori Community Centre Trust Board has formed a choral group, the members of which are people with any degree of Maori ancestry.
The move is intended to give Maoris in the city an opportunity to engage in choral activities and to make a contribution to the cultural life of Auckland.
‘Our young people have proved themselves in the light entertainment field, and we feel they can make just as valuable a contribution in the choral field,’ said Mr Kelly Harris, the choirmaster and conductor of the choir.
The trust board has insisted that the choir must not confine its singing to Maori music.

Farming

Pests to
Watch
For by A. E. Gibson

This month I would like to discuss some of the pests of farming which you are likely to have to deal with over the next few months. Damage done by these pests can be just as destructive on a sheep farm as on a dairy farm.

The Grass Grub
It is important to understand the life cycle of the grass grub. The adult beetle, commonly known as the brown beetle, is on the wing in November to early January. Eggs large and white are laid at least 3 inches in the soil and the young grubs hatch out in 7–16 days to start feeding on the roots of pasture plants. These grubs grow over the summer, autumn and spring, feeding all the time, and remain within 2–3 inches of the top of the ground until September or October, when they burrow to a depth of from 4–10 inches to pupate—a new generation of beetles appearing in November to start another cycle.
Most farmers are familiar with the type of damage done to pasture by large numbers of grass grubs. In such circumstances most of the grass is killed and the dead turf can be rolled up like a carpet. This type of damage is so obvious that no effort is required to persuade the farmer to use an insecticide to bring the grubs under control.
Recent investigations, however, carried out by the D.S.I.R., which involves the sampling of 70 paddocks in the North and South Islands, showed that whereas in grub-free pastures the leaf length could be as much as 6–8 inches in 4–6 weeks, areas of the same paddocks harbouring 1–9 grubs per square foot had leaf lengths of only 1–3 inches. The average reduction was over 3 inches in any 4–6 week period between the end of January and the end of August. The pastures at no stage showed what farmers usually consider to be typical grass grub damage. This rather startling discovery emphasises the necessity to treat pastures with D.D.T. where grubs are known to exist in the district even though no damage is visible on a farm.
If D.D.T. is properly used it will proof the pasture against grass grub damage.
One pound of 100 per cent D.D.T. per acre should be used where no evidence of grub can be seen but where there is a likelihood that they do exist. In other words this dressing will be an insurance and should be used particularly where new pastures are sown down. Where a pasture has been attacked and grubs are working actively the application rate should be doubled to two pound of 100 per cent D.D.T. per acre.
During March and April farmers are advised to go over the farm with a spade digging bits of soil to see if any grubs are present. It should be remembered that they will be working in the top 2 inches of soil and that they will be very small at that time of the year.
D.D.T. prills have proved an efficient insecticide and make it possible to apply accurately a comparatively small amount of D.D.T. required per acre without first having to mix the insecticide with fertiliser. The recommended rat of application in 16 lb of prills per acre, which contains 2 lbs of 100 per cent D.D.T. But good results have been recorded from the use of 12 lb prills, that is, 1 ½ lbs of 100 per cent D.D.T., and this lesser amount may be an economic proposition. The total cost including application should not exceed 25/- per acre.


Crickets
The main effect of the cricket is felt in the Auckland province particularly about Hauraki Plains and the North Auckland Peninsula where soils and climate are ideal for this pest. When seasons are favourable the cricket population can build up to immense hordes which cause widespread damage to pastures. It usually occurs around dry autumns when pastures plants have little power of recovery and it continues until the cooler weather when again the plants lack the vigour required to repair damage.
From February onward the light coloured cigar-shaped eggs about a tenth of an inch long are deposited by the female into the turf or just below the soil surface. Some eggs hatch in the following few weeks if conditions are satisfactory but generally it does not begin until October. A nymph emerges from the egg which is similar to an adult but is wingless and very small. It begins to feed immediately and as it feeds passes through a succession of moults until it becomes a winged adult. It is usually near the adult stage before damage is noticed.
The cricket is a surface feeder. It lives on rye grass as the most favoured pasture and although cocksfoot is readily eaten by the cricket, it has strong powers of recovery from damage. Clovers are much less attractive and are usually left until

other species are eliminated. As this damage is always associated with dry weather and as the crickets will also consume any seed which has fallen, there is little hope of recovery of the pasture.
Dieldrin applied as a dust in dieldrin superphosphate at 2 cwt to the acre kills crickets quickly and effectively. In this form 6 ozs. of dieldrin is used per acre. Dusting with D.D.T. is not effective.
Early February is the most effective time to treat affected pastures as if they are treated too early in December or January a second crop of crickets may infest the area. But on the other hand treatment should not be delayed until pasture damage is severe.


The Army Worm
The army caterpillar which is often referred to as army worm is the caterpillar stage of a common native night-flying moth. It has often devastated crops in summer or early autumn and in a number of districts has severely damaged pasture on river flats, and swamp areas usually after summer flood followed by warm muggy weather. An attack by army caterpillar cannot be predicted with complete precision but we can tell when conditions are suitable for the pest and keep a close watch for it. Hay after mast, especially paspallum, newly sown pastures or cereal crops or land subject to summer flooding are all vulnerable to army worm infestation and should be watched very carefully with a view to making remedial measures. Caterpillars usually confine their feeding to sunny faces on hill country and shady faces are generally not depleted. They prefer plants of the grass family and the way in which they avoid patches of dominant clover pasture is really remarkable. Thus areas of pasture showing high fertility with plenty of clovers are usually not affected. If unchecked they may continue to feed well into June.
Caterpillars can be controlled by spraying with either D.D.T. or Dieldrin and either killed off completely or prevented from moving on to fresh areas. Effective sprays applied by helicopter or aeroplane are 1 ½ pints of 15 per cent Dieldrin in 5–10 gallons of water (according to the lankness of the growth) where water is being used, or else 2 pints of 20 per cent D.D.T. in similar quantities of water per acre. Dieldrin is much quicker acting than D.D.T. but the latter is quite effective. A method of control is for a band of 50 to 60 feet in width to be sprayed with one pass of the aeroplane or helicopter and the perimeter of the advancing caterpillars. Half of the band is applied on the advancing caterpillars and half on the pastures ahead of them.
