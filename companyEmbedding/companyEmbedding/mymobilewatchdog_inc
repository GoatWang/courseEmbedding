4.0 out of 5 starsWARNING.... Looks like a good app but be aware of a couple of bugs...Bybobon February 26, 2014Please be aware of a few of things... first, this is not FREE. There is a monthly fee but it is not any more expensive then what the mobile companies charge for their services that do not do as much or have as much control. Second, and the big WARNING WARNING WARNING (I hope I have your attention); there is a potential HUGE security hole in this. You may put this on your child’s phone thinking they are protected but if they have an app on their device to kill tasks (like the all so popular 'Android Advanced Task Killer') then your child can disable 'My mobile Watchdog' in about 3 seconds even if you have blocked access to the task killer application. That’s right 3 seconds. I discovered the flaw while I was testing everything before giving my sons phone back to him. I also put it on my wife’s phone to test it. When she handed her phone to my son to see what he could do he had it disabled in... you guessed it, 3 seconds.I have also found another bug (although not as significant) and that is that if the phone is started in safe mode, your child can access settings to enable and disable GPS which can disable the location feature. (I personally have not been able to get the location feature to work but I cannot say that this is not due to an error on my part rather than a problem with the application).!! Please do not believe that your child is not smart enough to figure out how to run their device in safe mode because they are !!I think the application is safe as long as you do not have an add-on task killer but I am still running through a few tests and I have a support ticket open to address it. We will see if they actually respond to the ticket. (I have found their responsiveness to support to be a little less than acceptable).Our children are a great responsibility and with the technology out there they are at risk. Whither it is this application or another one, please find something or some way to keep track of what they are doing. The best of our children are 1 click away from their life being ruined. Please don’t chance it.

1.0 out of 5 starsMisleading Free AppByReeseon January 14, 2012I got everything configured and then only after going on their website, you have to "add a child".  To add a child, you then have to pay for it.  The app isn't really free, which is very misleading.  Had they made it obvious that there was a fee, I wouldn't have given it such a low rating.  In addition, because I couldn't even evaluate it enough to see what it did before paying for it, I am giving it a 1.  The idea is really nice, just would have been nice to try before purchasing.

    See all 15 reviews1.0 out of 5 starsMisleading Free AppByReeseon January 14, 2012Verified PurchaseI got everything configured and then only after going on their website, you have to "add a child".  To add a child, you then have to pay for it.  The app isn't really free, which is very misleading.  Had they made it obvious that there was a fee, I wouldn't have given it such a low rating.  In addition, because I couldn't even evaluate it enough to see what it did before paying for it, I am giving it a 1.  The idea is really nice, just would have been nice to try before purchasing.11 comment|

It was very confusing and not what I expected. The point in being able to read your child's texts, for me at least,  is that they have no knowledge that you're doing it.  If they know you're in essence spying,  they will alter their interactions with friends.Plus, downloading the app is free, using it is not.0Comment|
