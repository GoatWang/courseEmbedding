            KW charges late fees to owners even if they are paying on time!  I have had to file compaints with the DBPR. I hope the DBPR will correct this because KW doesnt give a rats a@&!

Water dissociation and pH
A remarkable property of pure water is that it dissociates to form hydrogen ions (H3O+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions

                     'I  will  employ  the  name  “hydrogen  ion  exponent”   and 
                           the  symbol pH   for  the  numerical  value  of the  exponent  of this power'


Søren Sørensen, 1909                  

The ionic product,  Kw
Water  dissociation (autoionization; self-ionization) occurs endothermically d due to electric field fluctuations between neighboring molecules. Dipole librations [191], 
      resulting from thermal effects and favorable localized hydrogen 
      bonding [567] that, together with nuclear quantum effects [2025], cause these fluctuations. The process may be facilitated by exciting the O-H stretch 
      overtone vibration [393]. Once formed (at an average concentration of about 1 M H2O-H+···OH- [1984]),h the ions may separate by means of the Grotthuss mechanism but normally (>99.9%) rapidly recombine (~20 ps [2171]) with a frequency in the terahertz range. 
      Rarely (about once every eleven hours per molecule at 25  °C, 
      or less than once a week at 0  °C) the localized hydrogen 
      bonding arrangement breaks before allowing the separated ions 
      to return [191]. The pair of ions 
      (H+, OH-)g hydrate independently and 
      continue their separate existencea for about 70 μs (this lifetime 
      also dependent on the extent of hydrogen bonding, being shorter 
      at lower temperatures). They tend to recombine when separated 
      by only one or two water molecules. 
H2O   
      H+ + OH- 
Kw = [H+][OH-]
 
Although the extent of dissociation is tiny ([H+]/[H2O] = 2.8 x 10-9 at 37  °C), the dissociation and consequential changes in the tiny concentrations 
      of hydrogen ions have absolute importance to living processes. 
      Hydrogen and hydroxyl ions are produced already hydrated.
 
H2O (liq)   
      H+(aq) + OH- (aq) 
 
 The protons (H+) initially hydrate as hydroxonium ions, H3O+ (also called 
      oxonium or hydronium ions) and  do not exist 
      as naked protons in liquid or solid water, where they interact extremely strongly with electron clouds. All three hydrogen atoms in the hydroxonium 
      ion are held by strong covalent bonds and are equivalent (that is, C3v symmetry in a vacuum). The thermodynamic properties of the dissociation at 25  °C and 0.1 MPa are ΔU° = 59.5 kJ mol-1, ΔV° = 22.13 cm3 mol-1, ΔH° = 55.8 kJ mol-1, ΔG° = 79.9 kJ mol-1, ΔS° = -80.8 J K-1 mol-1 [1938]. The proton is never found unhydrated in aqueous solution and the hydroxonium ions, H3O+, also has negligible independent existence in an aqueous environment [2134]. All the hydroxonium ion protons   are predominantly hydrogen bonded causing further hydration to H3O+(H2O)n, where n depends on the conditions such as temperature, solutes, pressure and method of determination.
 
To avoid the misleading presumption of the existence of bare protons similar to other bare cations (but see [2132] for an alternative view), the above equations are better written 
      as:
2 H2O(aq)   
      H3O+(aq) + OH-(aq)
      Kw = [H3O+][OH-]
 
 Both ions are ionic kosmotropes, hydrating and creating order in forming stronger hydrogen 
      bonds with surrounding water molecules than the water molecules form between themselves, and creating short chains of hydrogen bonded water molecules  [2025]. Remarkably, the volume change in this reaction 
 
2 H2O(aq)   
      H3O+(aq) + OH-(aq)  ΔV = -22.3 cm3 mol-1 
 
at 25 °C and infinite dilution, [1946], see Figure right,
due to the change in the hydration strength plus electrostriction, is about the same as one molecule of water (18.1 cm3 mol-1); when one water molecule ionizes, its volume effectively disappears.
 
The concentrations of H3O+ and OH- are normally taken as the total concentrations of all 
      the singly charged small clusters including these species. As other water molecules 
      are required to promote the hydrolysis, the equations below includes 
      the most important. None of these hydrated ions should be considered as 'fixed' structures, with further water molecules constantly coming and going in aqueous solution with timescales of picoseconds. No bare protons occur, however.
 
4 H2O   
      H5O2+ + H3O2-
10 H2O   
      H13O6+ + H7O4-
 
The concentration of hydroxonium and hydroxide 
      ions produced is therefore equal to the square root of the 
      dissociation constant (Kw). 
 
Aqueous OH- does not ionize further as (O2- + H2O  2OH-, 
      K > 1022). H3O+ does not protonate further to the tetrahedral H4O2+ ion as although H4O2+ may be metastable in the gas phase, it is thermodynamically unstable to loss of a proton [2133] and would immediately dissociate in aqueous solution. [Back to Top ]
pH
The hydronium (oxonium) ion concentration 
      (commonly called 'hydrogen ion concentration') is often given 
      in terms of the pH, where
 pH = Log10(1/[H3O+]) 
      = -Log10([H3O+]) 
 
(that is, [H3O+] = 10-pH)f with the concentration of  H3O+ in mol L-1. More precisely 
      pH = -Log10(aH) = -Log10(mHλH/m°) 
      where aH, mH, λH and m° are the relative (molality based) activity, molality, 
      molal activity coefficient j and standard molality (1 mol kg-1) 
      of the hydrogen ions. At the low concentrations normally found, 
      the molarity-based hydrogen ion concentration is close enough to the 
      relative (molality based) activity for its use in most circumstances. 
      The presence of salts and other solutes will generally reduce this activity and the activity varies with temperature. The molal activity of hydrogen ions cannot be determined directly 
      but may be determined using a glass electrode relative to 
      the response of standard buffer solutions of comparable ionic 
      strength. Glass electrode-determined pH values are error-prone 
      and calculated hydrogen ion concentrations should be treated 
      with caution, particularly at the extremes of pH [1890]. For more information and a list of primary pH standards see [813]. Proof that the use of the equation pH = -Log10(H+) may give misleading results (and pH = -Log10(aH) is preferred) is easily shown as the pH of 0.1 M HCl decreases when it is diluted with 5% M LiCl  
    [1107]. 

 
The pH scale was first introduced by Sørensen (as pH·) in 1909 
      [1036] using colorimetric measurements and the hydrogen electrode, which gives an electrode potential 
      proportional to pH. pH electrodes are now commonly used to determine the pH (see right).i The pH scale extends to negative numbers (for example, concentrated HCl has a pH of about -1.1) and to greater than 14 (for example, saturated NaOH has a pH of about 15.0) [1187]. There is a recent review of the pH of natural water [1712]. [Back] 
 
In a similar manner pKw is defined by pKw = Log10(1/Kw) = -Log10(Kw), 
      utilizing concentrations in mol L-1.
 
Where the solution contains significant amounts of heavy water (D2O)  the measured pH will differ slightly from that expected from the amounts of protonated species H3O+ + H2DO+ + HD2O+ + D3O+ [2953].
 
[Back to Top ] 


pKw = 
        -log10(Kw ) [IAPWS] 

Variation in Kw with T and P 
 Kw is very temperature 
      dependent, increasing with temperature (that is, from 0.001 ˣ 10-14 mol2 L-2 at -35  °C (pH 8.5) [112], 
      0.112 ˣ 10-14 mol2 L-2 at 0  °C (pH 7.5), to 0.991 ˣ 10-14 mol2 L-2 at 25  °C (pH 7.0), to 9.311 ˣ 10-14 mol2 L-2 at 60  °C (pH 6.5) [87]), to 
      10-12 mol2 L-2 at 
      300  °C (pH 6.0, ~50 MPa) [456] 
      in agreement with the high positive standard free energy. b There is a minimum at about 249  °C along the saturated pressure line for H2O and at about 257  °C for D2O (see right  [1865]). The pKw H2O minimum is about 0.74 lower than that for D2O [1865]. (see also conductivity maximum). 
 
A theoretical treatment of this temperature dependence 
      is available [763]. 

 






  Temperature and density dependence of dissociation has been examined [1321]. Dissociation depends on the pressure, with Kw doubling 
        at about 100 MPa; unsurprising in view of the negative ΔV associated with the 
        dissociation, -18.1 cm3 mol-1 . 
 
Dissociation also varies with solute concentration and ionic strength; for example, Kw goes through a maximum of about 
        2 ˣ 10-14 mol2 L-2 at about 
        0.25 M ionic strength (using tetramethylammonium chloride, 
        where possibly the change in hydrogen bonding caused by clathrate 
        formation encourages dissociation) before dropping to a 
        value of about 1 ˣ 10-16 mol2 L-2at 
        5 M (with higher concentrations disrupting the hydrogen bonding). Similar maxima occur with other salts such as NaCl (~0.6 M), KCl (~0.45 M), KNO3 (~0.5 M) and NaClO4 (~0.5 M) [2234]. Dissociation will also be different at interfaces; for example, it is greater at lipid membrane surfaces  [1964].
 
In ice, where the local hydrogen bonding rarely breaks to 
        separate the constantly forming and re-associating ions, the 
        dissociation constant is much lower (for example at -4  °C, Kw = 2 x 10-20 mol2 L-2 ). [Back to Top ]      
 Acidity, basicity and the pKa of water
There has been controversy and confusion for the last 90 years over the acidity e of water and its pKa; a confusion that is yet to be fully clarified. Does the pKa of H2O equal 15.74  [2966] or 14.00  [2965]? The answer depends on the  standard state used for the solvent water.
 
The acidity constant 
        (Ka) of  weak acid HA, d 
 HA (aq)+ H2O (l) A- (aq) + H3O+(aq) 
is defined by 
Ka= [H3O+][A-]/[HA]
pKa=  -Log10(Ka) 
Together with its conjugate base A-, we get,
    HA (aq) + H2O (l)  A-  (aq)+ H3O+ (aq)          ΔGa°   = - RT Ln( Ka)               
     A- (aq)+ H2O (l)   HA (aq) + OH- (aq)            ΔGb° = - RT Ln( Kb)              
_________________________________________________________
                                                H2O (l) + H2O (l)  H3O+(aq) + OH- (aq)      ΔGw°  = - RT Ln( Kw) = 79.89 kJ ˣ mol-1 [2967]
 
Where the ΔG° values are the standard Gibbs free energies for the equilibria.
Therefore, as ΔGw° = ΔGa° + ΔGb° , Ln( Kw) = Ln( Ka) + Ln( Kb) and 
pKa+ pKb = pKw        and        Kw = Ka ˣ Kb 
 
H2O, as a weak acid, may be treated in the same way
H2O  (l) + H2O (l)H3O+(aq) + OH-    (aq) 
Its pKa has been (mistakenly) derived as Ka= [H3O+][OH-]/[H2O] 
        = Kw/[H2O] = Kw/55.345 (at 
        25  °C) and pKa = pKw +1.743 (= 15.738 at 25  °C). However in this derivation the H2O is treated both as an acid ([H2O] in the denominator, equaling about 55.345 mol ˣ L-1) and the solvent (internalized in the Ka definition with a value of unity). This disparity in values introduces conflict.
 
The alternative (and correct) derivation utilizes the activity of water (equals unity) in the denominator [2965]
                                 Ka (H2O)= [H3O+][OH-] = Kw = 10-13.995            (a number without units) 
                               pKa = pKw = 13.995                              (H2O, 25  °C) 
  
H2O is a very weak acid, compare pKas of H2Te, H2Se and H2S are 2.6, 3.89 and 7.04 respectively). The pKb (= pKw - pKa = 0.00) related to this Ka is for the conjugate base (OH-) not H2O as commonly mistakenly cited. OH- is a strong base whereas H2O is a very weak base.    The pKb of H2O is derived exactly as pKa (above, as the equation generates both an acid and a base) and gives the same value (= 13.995 at 25  °C). 
 
H3O+ is a strong acid with associated Ka (H3O+) equaling unity exactly (see the equation below). pKa (H3O+) equals zero exactly and is invariant with temperature,  as ΔG° is necessarily zero. 
 H3O+(aq) + H2O (l)  H2O  (l) + H3O+(aq)     ΔG°    = - RT Ln(Ka (H3O+))    = 0.00 kJ ˣ mol-1 [2967]
 
There is a difficulty that has been ignored in these definitions as  Ka and Kb would normally be expressed in terms of activities rather than concentrations [1188] and the activity of pure H2O is defined as unity whereas that of solutes is defined relative to their standard state (1 mol ˣ kg-1) rather than the concentration of water (~55.345 mol ˣ L-1). It is important that the value chosen (pKa = 13.995 for H2O)  fits in with the known acidity and basicity of water compared with other materials. Whilst older published materials reported methanol as being more acidic (pKa = 15.3) than water [2107] (and so mistakenly favoring a pKa for water of 15.74), a recent re-analysis [2965] shows that water is 35-fold more acidic than methanol, a value that fits well with the pKa of H2O being ~14. 
 
This value (pKa = 14.00) may be separately determined from thermodynamic ΔG data  [2967]. [Back to Top ]    


 


Footnotes
a This low occurrence 
      means that at neutrality (pH 7 at 25  °C) c, 
      similarly charged ions are, on average, separated by vast 
      distances (~0.255 μm) in molecular 
      terms and (for example)  bacteria contain only a few tens of free hydrogen 
      ions. Contributing to this effect are the high dielectric 
      constant (encouraging charge separation) and high concentration of H2O      (~55.5 M; increasing the absolute amount dissociated). The 
      mean lifetime of a hydroxonium ion (1 ps; about the same as 
      that of a hydrogen bond) is such 
      that the charge could be associated with over 107 molecules of water before neutralization. 
 
It follows that pure water droplets containing less than about 108 water molecules (~0.1 μm radius) would usually (i.e. on average) contain no ions in the absence of surface effects. [Back]
 
b A bulk energy diagram 
      for the dissociation in bulk water has been described [604]. 
      [Back]
 
c Note that acid-base neutrality 
      only occurs when the concentration of hydrogen ions equals 
      the concentration of hydroxyl ions (whatever the pH). This 
      only occurs at pH 7 in pure water when at 25  °C. A solution 
      is acidic when the hydrogen ion concentration is greater than 
      the hydroxide ion concentration, whatever the pH. The pH of a neutral solution is numerically equal to half the pKw of the solution. Therefore a pH of 7 at 0  °C indicates a slightly acid solution (neutrality is pH 7.5) whereas a  pH of 7 at 50  °C indicates a slightly alkaline solution (neutrality is pH 6.6). [Back]
 
d In a vacuum the 
      reaction H2O  H+ + OH- requires over three times more energy (1.66 MJ mol-1) 
      than dissociation H2O  H· + ·OH 
      (531 kJ mol-1). In water the hydration of the ions (H+ ΔG° hydration -1112.5 kJ mol-1, this includes H3O+ ΔG° hydration -461.1 kJ mol-1; OH- ΔG° hydration -437.6 kJ ˣ mol-1 [1067])                     reduces the ΔG° of the reaction 
      2 H2O  H3O+ + OH- to +99.78 kJ ˣ mol-1 (These calculations assumes that  the standard state of the solvent water is taken as 1.0 M. If the standard state of the solvent water is unit activity or mole fraction (= 1.0), the ΔG° is +79.907 
      kJ ˣ mol-1 as given above). The dissociated radicals (H·, ·OH) are also somewhat stabilized in liquid water, as shown by the occasional dissociation of water [1066, see equations]. [Back] 
 
e
  Note that the 'acidity' of a material is commonly its pH and depends both on its pKa and its concentration. The 'acidity' of drinks and foodstuffs, however, also depends on the response of our taste buds.  [Back]    
 
f As Logarithms may only be taken of dimensionless numbers, all the concentrations (activities, partial pressures, etc.) in any Logarithmic expression are actually divided by unit values in the same units of that concentration  (activity, partial pressure, etc.); thus, for example here [H3O+] (concentration of of  H3O+ in mol L-1) is actually [H3O+]/(1.0 mol L-1).
 
The p in pH originated as the arbitrary choice for the naming of the electrode solutions 'p' and 'q' by Sørensen  
      [1036, 1891], but is now taken to mean the  'logarithm to the base 10 of the reciprocal of' (cologarithm) as in the function described above. [Back] 
 
g Strictly speaking these equations should be expressed in terms of activities rather than concentrations; thus 
Kw = [aH+][aOH-]
The derivations are easier to follow as given and usually the concentrations are so small that the difference is inconsequential. [Back] 
 
h Similar concentrations are found for ice [2171]. [Back] 
 
i Different membrane glasses may be used dependent on solution to be analysed (e.g. high temperatures, strong alkali or HF).
 
The electrode reaction for the Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl reference electrode is
AgCl + e-  Ag0 + Cl-                E = +0.197 V (in saturated KCl)
 [Back] 
 
j The activity coefficient of hydrogen ions depends on the acid concentration, temperature,  ionic strength, the dielectric constant, the size of the ions  and the density  of the medium. [Back] 
 
k The pH of a weak monoprotic acid of concentration c is:  
so long as cKa > Kw. [Back]
