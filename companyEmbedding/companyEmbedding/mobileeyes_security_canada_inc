MobileEyes System InspectorHome Page  //  Inspection & Permitting Products  //  MobileEyes System Inspector 
Sprinkler & Alarm Contractors no longer have to worry about the professionalism of inspection reports, the inconsistent, inaccurate or unclear reports that cause liability for your company or hurt your ability to get service and repair work.  Want to standardize your reports across all your technicians?
MobileEyes System Inspector software allows your technicians to do more inspections, more testing, produce more professional and complete reports faster, while generating more service and repair work for your business.

Eliminate hand-written reports without wasting time re-typing
Reduce risk of liability by producing more standardized, complete, NFPA compliant reports.
Increase service and repair work by portraying a more professional image.

Your front office can better coordinate your technicians with our included web-based, and mobile ready scheduling.  Use pre-built NFPA 17, NFPA 72, NFPA 25, NFPA 10, or your own custom inspection checklists – all electronically on your mobile ready device.
Inspection reports can be printed in the field, and/or delivered from the web via email.
Inspections Made Easy® with MobileEyes System Inspector
The System Inspector dashboard view provides an executive view of the state of your business:

See inspection volume by year, quarter, month, weeks and day – with the ability to zoom into individual inspections.
Review expected workload forecasts.
Calendar views of all scheduled activity.

NFPA compliant Inspection Forms

You can use our standard NFPA compliant inspection forms, your own forms, or a combination of the two.
You have a specific inspection process that makes sense and works for your organization.  With MobileEyes System Inspector you can incorporate custom inspection forms to fit your process.  If you have a custom form, we can accommodate it!  
MobileEyes System Inspector comes pre-loaded with all the NFPA compliant forms you’ll need to do:

Fire alarm inspections
Fire suppression system inspections
Security system inspections

Are you starting over fresh or expanding your company's services?  We include the full NFPA inspection, testing and maintenance checklists for you (with code references and categories by frequencies) including all the following fire suppression systems:

Dry chemical fire extinguishers (from NFPA 17)
Fire alarms (from NFPA 72)
Fire pumps (from NFPA 25)
Foam water spray systems (from NFPA 25)
Portable extinguishers (from NFPA 10)
Private fire service mains (from NFPA 35)
Sprinkler systems (from NFPA 25)
Standpipe and hose systems (from NFPA 25)
Water mist systems (from NFPA 25)
Water spray fixed systems (from NFPA 25)
Water storage tanks (from NFPA 25)

What happens when NFPA releases a new edition of their standards?  MobileEyes System Inspector will migrate all of your checklists to the new code set with ease!
Our revolutionary inspection checklist management and code migration technologies will enable your company to be efficient, thorough, and current.  Our license agreements with NFPA and The International Code Council protect your company from copyright infringement to prevent any intellectual property lawsuits.



Versatility

System Inspector supports testing, inspection, and maintenance of fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, fire suppression systems, and security systems.

Use our NFPA compliant forms or create your own.
Create and track device inventories.
Capture testing and measurement results.
Capture all aspects of a fire suppression system.




Standardized but customizable

MobileEyes comes loaded with all the NFPA compliant forms.  Use the forms ‘as is’ or customize them by rewording questions and adding questions specific to your company.  Create standardized deficiency comments to minimize data entry in the field and reduce variation in what your inspectors write on the report. 



Fully Loaded & Ready to Go

Setup is quick and easy—We deliver MobileEyes with the required NFPA forms and standards pre-loaded.  The transition is easy since we also load your client information.  You won’t start with an empty database and have to reenter everything yourself.



Web Based Data Storage

Take advantage of automatic upgrades and enhancements.  Giving you the ability to access data from anywhere in the world.



Support

We train your people, and continue to provide responsive and professional ongoing support.  Don't take our word for it - ask ANY of our customers across the U.S. and Canada about their support experience. When you need support, you will speak with a certified expert located within the United States.



Scheduling

Extensive scheduling and tracking with MobileEyes ensures none of your customers fall between the cracks.
Our automatic scheduling system ensures no inspections will fall through the cracks.  MobileEyes handles any inspection frequency and automatically schedules the next inspection for you.
Tools:

Set system rules for assigning inspections
View client contact information right from the schedule
Handle canceled appointments, rescheduling, assignment and re-assignment

Assist with workload balancing
Schedule service calls and repair work
Extensive filtering and sorting capability

A condensed schedule appears in calendar view on the executive dashboard, which is great for anticipating changes in work volumes. 



Mobile Inspections

Integrated handwriting recognition software automatically converts handwritten comments to type written text1
Spell checking
Carry all the customer, building, and system information for your scheduled inspections
Preloaded access to codes and standards

As soon as you finish your inspection, the next inspection for that customer is automatically scheduled.  We handle all inspection frequencies from weekly out to multi-year (3-year, 5-year, etc.)
A full set of tools allows you to:

Add inspections to the schedule unassigned or for a specific technician.
Handle canceled appointments, rescheduling, assignment and re-assignment
Add work order notes and instructions for technicians
Use the calendar view to easily see which technicians have open time slots (Coming soon!)
Schedule service calls and repair work




Reports

Print or email reports from the field with MobileEyes System Inspector software.
Are you performing building permit or fire protection inspections in the field; and then heading back to the office to type-up, print and mail the reports to various recipients?  Does it take days or even weeks to turn the inspection report around to the customer?  How is this impacting your cash flow and your customer’s view of your company?  How many hours do you waste typing up handwritten reports or entering your inspection results into a database?  
MobileEyes System Inspector makes it easy to complete the inspection electronically.  Professional reports can be printed on site or emailed to the customer. 
Cut your report turn around time from days or weeks to hours with MobileEyes System Inspector.

SAN ANTONIO, Aug. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Fire Rescue International - TradeMaster, the leader in mobile and cloud-based inspection and pre-plan software, today announced an integration partnership with reporting and records management software (RMS) company, Emergency Reporting.  The relationship provides the companies' mutual customers a seamless inspection and reporting solution that eliminates redundant data entry by enabling common data to pass between TradeMaster's pre-fire plan and inspection software, MobileEyes, and Emergency Reporting's incident reporting and records management product. 








"Fire departments and emergency service agencies frequently ask us to recommend incident reporting software capable of interfacing with MobileEyes so they can use the tools they prefer without redundant data entry," said Joe Krehel, President of TradeMaster. "Our aim with this and other integration relationships is to bring together the strengths of best-in-class products to meet the specific, diverse needs of departments large and small."

"We're looking forward to this partnership with TradeMaster as the integration with MobileEyes represents a quality product extension for our customers allowing us to offer a full-function inspection and pre-planning solution along with our existing capabilities," said Dave Adams, President of Emergency Reporting.
The integration ensures that data used by both systems remains consistent and current. The combined strength of both solutions will provide a comprehensive offering for departments requiring robust inspection capabilities in addition to incident reporting and/or records management.
"I look forward to the seamless exchange of data this interface offers," said Anthony Rosario, Fire Official of Dover Fire Prevention.  "The ability for firefighters and officers to have accurate information gathered through inspections is critical." 
The MobileEyes-Emergency Reporting interface is available now. For more information, go to http://www.mobile-eyes.us.com/lp/mobileeyes-reporting/.

Future of Mobility
"If you ask me whether an autonomous vehicle will become commonplace, my unequivocal answer is yes, there's no question about it. The technology is almost there, the world is almost there, there's an economic motive for getting there, and drivers will slowly start to get used to the idea that you can get rid of the boring task of driving." – Amnon Shashua, CTO and Co-Founder of Mobileye

Autonomous in Action

















Pillars of Autonomous Driving
Only the Combination of the Three Will Make Autonomous Driving a Reality 








Sensing
Mobileye produces software that conducts sensor fusion - interpreting data from camera sensors as well as radar and LiDAR sensors. We use an innovative and proprietary set of algorithms to detect objects and the safe path forward. This Environmental Model is the primary source of information to support the system's decision-making.





Mapping
Autonomous vehicles will require many system redundancies to deal with unforeseen circumstances. A high-definition map is required for precise localization of the vehicle, relative to road boundaries and intersections, under all conditions. Mobileye's Road Experience Management (REM™), which uses crowd-sourcing, is a unique, low-cost solution for building and rapidly updating this HD map.





Driving Policy
Once an autonomous vehicle can sense the scene around it and localize itself on a map, the final piece allowing it to share the road with human drivers is Driving Policy. Sensing, Mapping, and powerful computing platforms give the vehicle super-human sight and reaction times. Mobileye's Reinforcement Learning for Driving Policy will provide the human-like intuition and behavior required to analyze multivariable situations and negotiate with human drivers.

Under that, there's a chemically bonded tattoo, stating "Stolen Property" that even a determined thief can't remove and would find virtually impossible to explain to a potential purchaser.STOP Security Plates retain your property's value while it's under your control, but if ever stolen, the prominently displayed plate and the tattoo underneath completely remove any value on the resale market.



RecoveryThe value of STOP Security Plates goes beyond deterrence. If your equipment is just misplaced, STOP Security Plates are marked with a unique registration number that dramatically increases the incidence of recovery by providing an easy way to do the right thing.If someone finds your lost STOP-plated equipment where it shouldn't be, they simply contact STOP by phone on our 24-hour hotline or connect with us online. STOP will make the necessary arrangements to get your machine back to you quickly.

Theft PreventionMarking or "branding" equipment in an attempt to deter   theft and improve tracking is not a new idea. The way that STOP does it is. And, the remarkable reduction in equipment losses enjoyed by our clients make it an idea worth your time!
Two sizes are available. The standard plate for computers, laptops, tablets, etc. and a smaller plate for cell phones, iPad minis, and smaller equipment.
21⁄2" x 21⁄8"2" x 3⁄4"

The only security plate in the marketAt the heart of the STOP system is our patented security plate.  Made of a tough photo-anodized aluminum, it is affixed to your equipment with cyanoacrylate adhesive so strong that removal of the security plate requires up to 800 pounds of pressure. Removal of the plate will noticeably, physically alter the case.

An indelible tattoo stops professional thievesWe don't stop there, however!  It's our unique, patented installation process that makes the STOP system so unusually effective.  During the simple do-it-yourself installation of each security plate, a permanent tattoo is chemically etched into your equipment, beneath the plate.  If someone succeeds in removing the plate (special tools are required), the indelible marking is exposed.


The unique tattoo presents a bold-type declaration that the object is "Stolen Property" and a toll-free number for verification and anti-theft information. This tattoo cannot be removed by any means without marking or defacing the case, and such a mark is recognized by police and resellers as a telltale sign that the property is stolen.


Professional thieves are not interested in equipment itself, only in its resale value on the open market. STOP's patented security plate and tattoo dramatically reduce theft by reducing the value of stolen equipment to zero.The police traceable plate and sticker deter "casual" theft.  There is more.  Each security plate bears a clear, dissuasive warning message that the property is monitored and police traceable, along with a warning that the tattoo has been etched into the equipment. Each plate also bears a unique barcode linked to the owner's tracking information, and a toll-free telephone number to call in case lost or stolen equipment is found.


Included with the standard size STOP plate is a bright red "Police Identifiable Warning Sticker" we send along for you to apply next to the plate.  Result: the guy who finds your laptop at the airport, or the employee who may have considered permanently "borrowing" an office cell phone - is highly unlikely to do so when it is clear that a 30-second check on the equipment will reveal him to be a criminal.


Marking your equipment with STOP plates makes it clear to all potential thieves that the equipment can never be shown to anyone without great risk of their facing criminal charges.

Equipment RecoverySTOP plates deliver high returns.Attaching a STOP security plate is not only the most important step you   can take in deterring theft. Our plates also connect you to our highly effective international tracking and retrieval service - the service that pushes STOP   security ahead of the rest.Numbers talk.Our return rate for lost property is unusually high.  We have successfully returned 9 out of every 10 items reported lost for the more than 2,000 companies that use the STOP system worldwide.  Given that our typical client has spent $4000 per laptop, before including the value of software, data and time spent inputting data into the machine, STOP's high reduction in losses results in significant savings!How does it work?Each STOP security plate bears a unique identifying number, along with the toll-free number for our anti-theft and ownership verification hotline.  STOP's worldwide registry links the plate i.d. number to the make, model, serial number and owner of the equipment it's affixed to.  A call to the toll-free number thus yields quick and easy ownership   verification.Our full service recovery system means you can finally relax.Misplaced computers represent more than 60 percent of lost equipment and   our service is extremely effective in returning these valuables to you.  Should you misplace your laptop, etc., experience has shown it is very likely that a fellow traveler or commuter, a service center, or whoever finds it -- will call our 800 hotline.Immediately after we've received a call locating your lost equipment, we call you to let you know where your machine is.  But we don't stop there:

We take care of returning all recovered property!Our retrieval service includes overseeing the return of your valuable   equipment - another headache you won't be suffering through once you register with STOP.


"Hot" property is returned, not resold.In any case of suspected theft, STOP will help you register the loss with local police and the FBI. We will also list the loss with INTERPOL in France, and throughout our own expanded international security network.


When the stolen equipment is offered for sale (the goal in most instances of theft), potential buyers, resellers, or whoever comes across it - typically become suspicious about the machine due to the warnings on the plate.  They call STOP's clearly marked 800 hotline and we advise them on the spot that the equipment is stolen property.  Resale is prevented and recovery follows quickly.If the computer is taken by a professional thief, who foolishly attempts to remove the security plate, the permanently etched tattoo underneath the plate displays the words "Stolen Property" in bold type, along with the toll-free number connected to our retrieval service.  Resale value for the marked item dwindles to nothing with this marking exposed.  Police and/or potential computer resellers who come across equipment stripped down to our tattoo call the 800 number and our rapid retrieval service is put into motion.  Thus, the safety of keeping or reselling a "hot" computer marked with STOP plates disappears and most are returned via our retrieval service.

Asset TrackingAs effective as STOP's security plates are in theft deterrence, the beauty of the system lies in its ability to track your organization's inventory of equipment while we protect it.  And this complete service pays for itself very quickly.The key is the security plate's barcode.  When used in combination with a hand-held barcode scanner and asset tracking software - tracking and maintaining your inventory become remarkably simple.
