Jay Leno is selling products to make his vintage cars shine. (May 16, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR)

Charles Fleming




Jay Leno hosted a group of gear heads at his Burbank garage last week. He wanted to show off the cream of his car and motorcycle collection, and to hawk new products.Called Jay Leno’s Advanced Vehicle Care, it’s the first branded retail product line to emerge from Leno’s passion for vintage vehicles, and from his long-running “Jay Leno’s Garage” TV and Internet series.The car collector, comedian and former late-night TV host spent two hours leading a small audience around the massive compound, which sits just off a Hollywood Burbank Airport  runway.Here was his favorite car, a McLaren F1 British racer. There was his oldest, a Stanley steam-driven car from 1906.

In another room stood the 1955 Buick Roadmaster that was Leno’s first California car purchase. (He paid $350, slept in it while he looked for an apartment and later took his wife-to-be on dates in it.)










(Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)



In yet another is an assembly of Brough Superior motorcycles — more than a dozen of them — that in the 1920s were the world’s most desirable two-wheeled machines. (That’s what T.E. Lawrence was riding when a crash cost him his life.)“It’s like having every girl you ever went out with in high school, all in the same room,” Leno said of his collection, which consists of cars and motorcycles kept in constant readiness to drive and ride. “And they all look the same, and they’ll always look the same.”Guiding around his selfie-snapping fans, Leno seemed to have a complete back story for every vehicle, and a quick quip for every topic.

Self-driving cars: “Most cars are driving themselves already,” he said. “I mean, look around. People are putting on makeup and eating a sandwich. Nobody’s driving these cars now.”Cross-country “Cannonball Run" events: “I don’t like those things,” he said. “You don’t want to be some rich guy racing across the country. Someone's going to run into a school bus full of nuns and ruin the sport for everyone.”Electric cars, and their advertised ranges: “They say it gets 50 miles,” he said. “But electric cars, it’s like sex. Nobody ever tells the truth about it. None of them get the range they advertise.”Leno said he’d long resisted putting his name on car care products. But after spending 10 years developing this line of polishers, rubs and waxes, he said, he thought he might have made a mistake.“The right way to do this is find a company and have them give you a big check to endorse their product,” Leno said. “Then there’s the stupid way. That's what we did.”Leno worked mostly with Jeremy Porrazzo, who for more than a decade had been Leno’s car cleaning specialist.Years before, Porrazzo had offered to come into Leno’s garage during his spare time, to polish and clean Leno’s collection of 160 cars and 130 motorcycles — for free.He was hoping the car legend would help him launch a brand of car cleaning products.Two years later, Leno offered him the official car-polishing gig. When the former TV host began asking Porrazzo how he made his cleaning compounds, the new company was born.“That was always the endgame,” Porrazzo said. “To get a branded product out there with Jay’s name on it.”The line is composed of 14 different vehicle care products, with another six more on the way, said the company’s marketing director, Chris Walters.Unlike similar lines, these are color coded, inside the bottles as well as on the labels — orange for quick detailing, blue for hand wax, red for vehicle wash — for easy identification. All the formulas and mix designs were developed in-house.Available online only via Leno’s “Garage” website, the products range in price from $9.99 to $17.99 a bottle.Leno’s favorite? “The metal polish,” Porrazzo said. “He goes through a half-gallon of it at a time.”Leno joked that the products are offered with very little markup, “which is the other stupid way to do it.”A Leno representative said the military service organization USO, one of the comic’s favorite charities, would be among the beneficiaries of every product sale.Video: Go inside Leno’s garage

In addition, Mr. Moskowitz has served as our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since 1983.  Mr. Moskowitz currently serves on the Board of Trustees of Alfred University.  Mr. Moskowitz obtained a B.S. in Ceramic Engineering from Alfred University in 1961 and an M.B.A. from the University of Southern California in 1967.  Mr. Moskowitz was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science degree by Alfred University in 2005.



Mr. Moskowitz is the most senior executive at Ceradyne, having founded the predecessor company in 1967, over 44 years ago.  His academic background in the field of ceramics and business, and length of service in the senior aspects of managing Ceradyne's business, result in his unique qualifications to serve on Ceradyne's Board of Directors.  Mr. Moskowitz, over the decades, has been the individual most identified by Ceradyne's customers, investors and, in general, the financial community as the lead person at Ceradyne.  In the Company's earlier history, Mr. Moskowitz was involved in the technical development of several of the products which now make up the bulk of Ceradyne's product lines, and in more recent years, was directly involved in several of the major acquisitions and financial decisions of the Company as it grew.  Mr. Moskowitz is generally recognized by the ceramic industry as one of its senior leaders.

Product Description▼▲
Science in the Age of Reason is an engaging, exciting, hands-on, multilevel elementary resource that is the fourth in a series of books by Dr. Jay Wile. Introducing scientific concepts in the context of history, students will follow the work of the scientists who lived during the period known as "The Age of Reason" (1656-1850). Arranged chronologically, chapters focus both on concepts as well as thinkers, including Halley, Anders Celsius, Benjamin Franklin, Carl Linneaus, Joseph Black, Erasmus Darwin, Lazzaro Spallanzani, James Hutton, John Dalton, Thomas Young, and others alongside topics that include carbon dioxide, atomic theory, Celsius/Fahrenheit temperatures, conductors and insulators, evaporation, genera and classification, erosion, and inoculation.  A total of 90 lessons are included; divided into chronological sections, each section contains 12 regular lessons and 3 challenge lessons for a total of 15 lessons. Depending on how much science you wish to teach in your homeschool, there are enough lessons to cover every other day for the length of a school year, or, you can finish the book by only doing two lessons a week (and skipping the challenge lessons). Hands-on activities are included in each lesson; most are experiments (that have been field-tested for hom eschoolers!), and include step by step directions to keep you on track. As this curriculum was designed for all elementary-aged students to use together, the main lesson text is written in a conversational, easy-to-read tone that all students can comprehend; illustrations and photographs are integrated throughout. Review assignments close the lesson; questions are grouped for "youngest, older, and oldest" students. Students are instructed to keep a notebook, and the activities include comprehension and reflection notebook assignments. Experiments use common household goods, though for some items that may not be on-hand, a full list (organized by section) is provided at the beginning of the book. The "Helps & Hints" booklet is divided into three sections that provide helpful notes on the lesson and experiments for the textbook, six tests covering multiple chapters, and answers to the tests. Elementary Grades K-6. This Kit Includes: Science in the Age of Reason Textbook, 302 pages, hardcover and non-consumable. Helps and Hints; 64 pages, softcover. Non-reproducible; consumable softcover.

            This is such an excellent chemistry course. I took AP chemistry in high school and again in college, but those courses did not explain things as well as this course by Dr. Wile. His conversational style and clear/straightforward examples make the material approachable. 


I have taught Dr. Wile's chemistry course several times in a co-op setting, and I was excited to see that he had come out with this new one. It is a delight to teach. The progression is incremental and students get all the help they need. I appreciate the online helps. Also, the option to print the Comprehension Questions and Review Questions as worksheets makes it easier for the student. The reproducible extra review questions are so helpful to prepare students for the test.  


Thank you, Dr. Wile, for another GREAT course!!!

            The way in which this book is written makes it very easy for the students to understand and learn the material.  It is more conversational rather than just dry facts and equations that can sometimes be challenging to digest mentally.  The author of this book  is gifted with a teaching style that makes his books easy to follow and comprehend.
