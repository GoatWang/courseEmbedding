Very warm for a fleece that is semi see through when shining a light at it. Breathes very well.  Feels awesome to the touch.  Overall length is good. Can wear around town if needed.  Some issues I have with TNF is their sizing.  I normally wear small in jackets. It this small was way too tight. The medium fell like a small from other companies. The armpit and under the armpit to the back is crazy tight where it kind of bothers me even when I just have a t shirt on and I'm not muscular.  Not sure how a very fit muscular person can wear it. Reaching up is fine but reaching forward is very restrictive.  Can't really wear a large since it will be  too big and sleeves will be too long.  I have talked to some TNF staffs and some have said the same thing about their sizing issues.  Some main say you can't judge it by the fit but that is a major part of clothing. I would recommend this to a friend if it can fit their body. I'm still debating on returning it or not. I have the L5 jacket also and the fit is slightly better but not by much.Fit:Feels too smallSleeve Length:Feels true to lengthWas this a gift?:NoBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/28/2017 4.0I would by this product again, but in a different size.

Dry quickly and wicks moisture well. Hood fits pretty snug, but not so tight that you cant where a beanie under it. One issue I had is the fit around my chest area; it was really tight (though now it has stretched to be perfect). If you have broader shoulders for your size, maybe go a size up for a better fit, unless you dont mind wearing it for a few days to stretch it out.Fit:Feels too smallSleeve Length:Feels true to lengthWas this a gift?:NoBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/21/2017 5.0Very Nice & Warm By Saarlandfrom Louisville, KYAbout Me Casual/ RecreationalProsComfortableDries QuicklyLightweightStylishWarmConsBest UsesCasual WearCold WeatherCyclingHikingRunningWet WeatherComments about TheNorthFace MEN'S L2 FLEECE MID-LAYER:Very nice and soft jacket.Fit:Feels true to sizeSleeve Length:Feels true to lengthWas this a gift?:NoBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review2/26/2017 5.0Light and Warm.

I have always loved the Summit Series product line because East Coast weather in the winter time is so unpredictable. I have had oreviius  hooded jackets before from The North Face co, but this one is exceptionally well designed and sewn together. Mechanically designed seams and architecture had my eyes welded on this jacket. I purchased a stretch hooded jacket and super diez down jacket before. Both were warm but the hooded jacket developed holed from my keys in the stretch materials and the down clumped after washing with the super diez. So I need to upgrade and discovered the summit series L3 and L2 for layering and warmth. Man what a great decision I made. I am truly warm all the time and when I get to warm I can loose the coat and just wear the L2 jacket. It warm comfortable and soft. I hope this helps with your next purchase.Fit:Feels true to sizeSleeve Length:Feels true to lengthWas this a gift?:NoBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review12/29/2016 5.0Finally By NSHuskyfrom Antigonish, Nova ScotiaAbout Me Gym RatProsBreathableComfortableDries QuicklyLightweightStylishWarmConsBest UsesCasual WearCold WeatherCyclingHikingRunningComments about TheNorthFace MEN'S L2 FLEECE MID-LAYER:The style of this jacket is amazing. Very subtle futuristic look and feel to it. I ordered online and when it came I immediately fell in love with look and fit. I was a bit skeptic about how warm it would actually be. I ended up being very pleased. I live in Nova Scotia and I use a lot of base layer's once the cold weather starts. I actually bought the L1 summit series as a companion (Call it the Ironman layer.. When combined I would rate it -5 tops. I am 6'0 195 pounds with and athletic build. Fits snug but that's what you want it to do. Its lose where you need it and form fitting wear its supposed to be.

By Bubbujenkinsfrom Indiana, PAComments about TheNorthFace MEN'S L2 FLEECE MID-LAYER:The L2 Jacket is very comfortable and warm for me to wear for such a light and thin jacket.  It seems to be made of one very durable piece that will probably last be a very long time without tearing at the seems.  A nice part about the jacket, was how the reflective bits sewn in never felt like they would get caught on something and tear off. The biggest problem, was how hard it was for the jacket to bend but that problem was fixed once I wore the jacket long enough.Was this a gift?:YesBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review12/30/2015(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Great Midlayer, very breathable and optimally warm By Kylefrom Markham, CanadaProsbreathableTemperature regulationConsHood not adjustableBest UsesHikingTrail runningComments about TheNorthFace MEN'S L2 FLEECE MID-LAYER:Having used it many times on my runs, it is surprisingly breathable, giving its use of the more heavily constructed fleece.
