P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.90      Net Money Flow ($)  -180,686    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock 
by us will be approximately $62.9 million, after deducting the estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares 
in full, the net proceeds to us will be approximately $72.7 million. We intend 
to use $8.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering received by us to 
pay a portion of the purchase price of SharePlus, and to contribute all but 
$5.0 million of the remaining net proceeds to the Bank to be used for general 
corporate purposes. Other than SharePlus, we have no current plans, arrangements
or understandings to make any acquisitions. However, at any given time we may 
be evaluating other acquisition candidates, conducting due diligence and may 
have entered into one or more letters of intent. We cannot assure you that we 
will enter into any definitive agreements in respect of any such transaction.


The banking business is highly competitive, and our profitability will
depend principally upon our ability to compete with other banks and non-bank
financial institutions located in our market areas in Texas for lending
opportunities, deposit funds, bankers and acquisition candidates. Our banking
competitors in our target markets include Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America,
BBVA Compass, Amegy, Comerica, Regions, Prosperity Bank, BancorpSouth,
Independent Bank, Texas Capital and various community banks.

We are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects of our business from
banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, credit
unions and other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual
funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, asset-based non-bank
lenders, insurance companies and certain other non-financial entities, including
retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain
governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can.

Many of the banks and other financial institutions with which we compete
have greater financial strength, marketing capability and name recognition than
us and operate on a statewide, regional or nationwide basis. These institutions
are also likely to have legal loan limits substantially in excess of those that
we maintain. Such institutions can perform certain functions for their
customers, including trust, securities brokerage and international banking
services, which we presently do not offer directly. Although we may offer these
services through correspondent banks, the inability to provide such services
directly may be a competitive disadvantage and this may affect our ability to
generate business, attract experienced bankers and capitalize on acquisition
opportunities.

We also face competition for acquisition opportunities in connection with
the implementation of our acquisition strategy. Because there are a limited
number of acquisition opportunities in our target markets, we face competition
from other banks and financial institutions, many of which possess greater
financial, human, technical and other resources than we do. Our ability to
compete in acquiring target institutions will depend on our available financial
resources to fund the acquisitions, including the amount of cash and cash
equivalents we have and the liquidity and market price of common stock. In
addition, increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration
that we will be required to pay in order to successfully capitalize on
attractive acquisition opportunities.

In addition, recent developments in technology and mass marketing have
permitted larger companies to market loans and other products and services more
aggressively to our small business customers. Such advantages may enable our
competitors to realize greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies
than we can. Further, some of the non-bank competitors are not subject to the
same extensive regulations that govern the Company and the Bank. Various
legislative acts in recent years have led to increased competition among
financial institutions and competition from both financial and non-financial
institutions is expected to continue.

We have been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions
by providing a high level of personalized banking service to professionals and
owner-operated businesses and by emphasizing quick and flexible responses to
customer demands; establishing long-term customer relationships and building
customer loyalty; and by offering products and services designed to address the
specific needs of our customers. We rely heavily on the continued business
generation of our portfolio bankers and the efforts of our officers and
directors for the solicitation and referral of potential customers and we expect
this to continue for the foreseeable future.


Company Description
We are a Texas focused bank holding company headquartered in Houston, Texas.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Green Bank, N.A., a nationally chartered commercial
bank, provides commercial and private banking services primarily to Texas based
customers through twelve full service branches in the


 Houston, Dallas and Austin
MSAs. The Houston, Dallas and Austin MSAs are our target markets, and we believe
their growing economies and attractive demographics, together with our scalable
platform, provide us with opportunities for long-term and sustainable growth.
Our emphasis is on continuing to expand our existing business by executing on
our proven portfolio banker driven business model as well as pursuing select
strategic acquisitions and attracting additional talented bankers. As of
March 31, 2014, we had consolidated total assets of $1.8 billion, total loans of
$1.4 billion (of which $1.39 billion were originated by us and $18.8 million
were acquired), total deposits of $1.5 billion and total shareholders' equity of
$203.6 million.
