RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif., March  10, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cesca Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:KOOL), an autologous cell-based regenerative medicine company, today announced that Dr Xiaochun Xu (44) has been appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors.

Since 2000 he served as a Project Leader at Pfizer, as a Director of Research at two publicly-traded companies and as a Vice President at Founder Group, a major Chinese technology conglomerate with interests in information technology, pharmaceuticals, real estate, finance, and commodities trading.

The Company’s ongoing phase III clinical program for the treatment of patients with late stage critical limb ischemia represents a best-in-class approach in its category. If approved, it will address a severe medical condition and a substantial unmet medical need. It will benefit tens of thousands of patients with limb ischemia and related conditions.
