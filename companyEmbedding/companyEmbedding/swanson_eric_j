Eric J. Swanson is an American lawyer and the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of BATS Global Markets, the third-largest stock exchange in the United States.
Swanson worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission as a lawyer from 1996 to 2006, rising to the level of Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. Subsequently, he worked at Ameriprise Financial as Vice President of Regulatory Strategy.
Swanson is married to Shana Madoff, who worked at the firm of her uncle Bernard Madoff as a rules and compliance officer and attorney until it was closed when the multibillion-dollar Madoff investment scandal was uncovered. Swanson met Shana Madoff originally when he was conducting an inadequate SEC examination of whether Bernie Madoff's firm was front running customer trades from the market making unit—completely missing the multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme that Shana's own cousins (Bernie's sons) would expose to the SEC in December 2008.

Early life and education[edit]
Swanson, a Minneapolis, Minnesota, native, graduated from the University of Minnesota (B.A.; 1990) and obtained a law degree from the Hamline University School of Law (J.D.; 1993).[1][2][3][4]
Securities and Exchange Commission[edit]
Following a period of time in which he practiced non-securities-related law, Swanson worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a lawyer from August 1996 to 2006.[1][5] While at the SEC, he received in August 2004 a Capital Markets Award, related to work in the area of SEC examinations of conflicts of interest.[4] At the end of his tenure, he was Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, and reported to the head of the SEC's inspection program responsible for regulatory oversight of trading on the securities exchanges and ECNs, supervising 8–18 staffers.[1][5][6]
Madoff[edit]




Bernard Madoff


Swanson is the husband of Shana Madoff, who is daughter of Peter Madoff. She is also a niece of Bernard Madoff, who operated a Ponzi scheme that is considered to be the largest financial fraud in U.S. history.[7][8][9] She worked under her father at her uncle's firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BMIS),[8][10] as a rules and compliance officer and attorney.[7][11][12] She reported to her father who was responsible for ensuring that BMIS complied with its legal and regulatory obligations, and signed documents assuring the SEC that BMIS's business records were truthful and accurate.[11][13]
Swanson met Shana Madoff in April 2003.[7][14][15] The two met in 2003 at an industry event during an examination of Bernie Madoff by the SEC as to whether Bernie Madoff was front running customer orders, totally missing the multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme that would be exposed in December 2008. The two had periodic contact thereafter in connection with Mr. Swanson speaking at industry events organized by a SIFMA committee on which Shana Madoff sat. During 2003 Swanson sent Shana's father Peter Madoff two regulatory requests, although by the time of the second request Mr. Swanson's responsibility for the examination had been transfserred to a different Assistant Director at the SEC.[7][16][17][18][19][20]
In February 2006, Swanson was emailed by Assistant Director John Nee that the SEC’s New York Regional Office was investigating a complaint that Bernard Madoff might be running “the biggest Ponzi scheme ever.”[16] In April 2006, Swanson began to date Shana Madoff. Mr. Swanson reported the relationship to his supervisor who wrote in an email "I guess we won't be investigating Madoff anytime soon."[21]
In 2006, the SEC's New York Enforcement Office, of which Mr. Swanson was not a part, closed its investigation of Bernie Madoff. On 15 September 2006, Swanson left the SEC.[7][22] On 8 December 2006, Swanson and Shana Madoff became engaged.[7][23]
In 2009, after the scandal broke, SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz investigated, and concluded that there was no evidence that Swanson's romantic relationship with Shana Madoff influenced the closing of the SEC investigation of Madoff.[24][25][not in citation given] He did conclude, however, that: Swanson's communication with Shana during the period of time he was engaged in a cause examination of her uncle and father's firm, created the appearance of a potential conflict of interest.[21]
The September 29, 2007, wedding between Swanson and Shana Madoff was attended by Lori Richards, the SEC's Director of Compliance Investigations and Examinations, who oversaw the Division in which Mr. Swanson worked at the SEC.[15][21][26][27] In 2008, Bernard Madoff spoke at a business roundtable meeting of his "very close" relationship with an SEC lawyer, and chuckled: "my niece even married one".[28][29] In April 2009, Richards recused herself from the Madoff investigation.[26]
Ameriprise Financial[edit]
Subsequent to working at the SEC, Swanson was a Vice President of regulatory strategy at Ameriprise Financial, a financial services company based in Minnesota.[1][2]
BATS[edit]
Swanson is the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of BATS Global Markets, an electronic stock exchange that is the third-largest stock exchange in the United States, which he joined as General Counsel in January 2008.[1][30] He was hired in part to assist the exchange in its effort to obtain exchange status from the SEC.[1]

Eric J. Swanson is an American lawyer and the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of BATS Global Markets, the third-largest stock exchange in the United States.
Swanson worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission as a lawyer from 1996 to 2006, rising to the level of Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. Subsequently, he worked at Ameriprise Financial as Vice President of Regulatory Strategy.
Swanson is married to Shana Madoff, who worked at the firm of her uncle Bernard Madoff as a rules and compliance officer and attorney until it was closed when the multibillion-dollar Madoff investment scandal was uncovered. Swanson met Shana Madoff originally when he was conducting an inadequate SEC examination of whether Bernie Madoff's firm was front running customer trades from the market making unit—completely missing the multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme that Shana's own cousins (Bernie's sons) would expose to the SEC in December 2008.

Early life and education[edit]
Swanson, a Minneapolis, Minnesota, native, graduated from the University of Minnesota (B.A.; 1990) and obtained a law degree from the Hamline University School of Law (J.D.; 1993).[1][2][3][4]
Securities and Exchange Commission[edit]
Following a period of time in which he practiced non-securities-related law, Swanson worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a lawyer from August 1996 to 2006.[1][5] While at the SEC, he received in August 2004 a Capital Markets Award, related to work in the area of SEC examinations of conflicts of interest.[4] At the end of his tenure, he was Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, and reported to the head of the SEC's inspection program responsible for regulatory oversight of trading on the securities exchanges and ECNs, supervising 8–18 staffers.[1][5][6]
Madoff[edit]




Bernard Madoff


Swanson is the husband of Shana Madoff, who is daughter of Peter Madoff. She is also a niece of Bernard Madoff, who operated a Ponzi scheme that is considered to be the largest financial fraud in U.S. history.[7][8][9] She worked under her father at her uncle's firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BMIS),[8][10] as a rules and compliance officer and attorney.[7][11][12] She reported to her father who was responsible for ensuring that BMIS complied with its legal and regulatory obligations, and signed documents assuring the SEC that BMIS's business records were truthful and accurate.[11][13]
Swanson met Shana Madoff in April 2003.[7][14][15] The two met in 2003 at an industry event during an examination of Bernie Madoff by the SEC as to whether Bernie Madoff was front running customer orders, totally missing the multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme that would be exposed in December 2008. The two had periodic contact thereafter in connection with Mr. Swanson speaking at industry events organized by a SIFMA committee on which Shana Madoff sat. During 2003 Swanson sent Shana's father Peter Madoff two regulatory requests, although by the time of the second request Mr. Swanson's responsibility for the examination had been transfserred to a different Assistant Director at the SEC.[7][16][17][18][19][20]
In February 2006, Swanson was emailed by Assistant Director John Nee that the SEC’s New York Regional Office was investigating a complaint that Bernard Madoff might be running “the biggest Ponzi scheme ever.”[16] In April 2006, Swanson began to date Shana Madoff. Mr. Swanson reported the relationship to his supervisor who wrote in an email "I guess we won't be investigating Madoff anytime soon."[21]
In 2006, the SEC's New York Enforcement Office, of which Mr. Swanson was not a part, closed its investigation of Bernie Madoff. On 15 September 2006, Swanson left the SEC.[7][22] On 8 December 2006, Swanson and Shana Madoff became engaged.[7][23]
In 2009, after the scandal broke, SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz investigated, and concluded that there was no evidence that Swanson's romantic relationship with Shana Madoff influenced the closing of the SEC investigation of Madoff.[24][25][not in citation given] He did conclude, however, that: Swanson's communication with Shana during the period of time he was engaged in a cause examination of her uncle and father's firm, created the appearance of a potential conflict of interest.[21]
The September 29, 2007, wedding between Swanson and Shana Madoff was attended by Lori Richards, the SEC's Director of Compliance Investigations and Examinations, who oversaw the Division in which Mr. Swanson worked at the SEC.[15][21][26][27] In 2008, Bernard Madoff spoke at a business roundtable meeting of his "very close" relationship with an SEC lawyer, and chuckled: "my niece even married one".[28][29] In April 2009, Richards recused herself from the Madoff investigation.[26]
Ameriprise Financial[edit]
Subsequent to working at the SEC, Swanson was a Vice President of regulatory strategy at Ameriprise Financial, a financial services company based in Minnesota.[1][2]
BATS[edit]
Swanson is the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of BATS Global Markets, an electronic stock exchange that is the third-largest stock exchange in the United States, which he joined as General Counsel in January 2008.[1][30] He was hired in part to assist the exchange in its effort to obtain exchange status from the SEC.[1]

Eric J. Swanson is an American lawyer and the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of BATS Global Markets, the third-largest stock exchange in the United States.
Swanson worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission as a lawyer from 1996 to 2006, rising to the level of Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. Subsequently, he worked at Ameriprise Financial as Vice President of Regulatory Strategy.
Swanson is married to Shana Madoff, who worked at the firm of her uncle Bernard Madoff as a rules and compliance officer and attorney until it was closed when the multibillion-dollar Madoff investment scandal was uncovered. Swanson met Shana Madoff originally when he was conducting an inadequate SEC examination of whether Bernie Madoff's firm was front running customer trades from the market making unit—completely missing the multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme that Shana's own cousins (Bernie's sons) would expose to the SEC in December 2008.

Early life and education[edit]
Swanson, a Minneapolis, Minnesota, native, graduated from the University of Minnesota (B.A.; 1990) and obtained a law degree from the Hamline University School of Law (J.D.; 1993).[1][2][3][4]
Securities and Exchange Commission[edit]
Following a period of time in which he practiced non-securities-related law, Swanson worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a lawyer from August 1996 to 2006.[1][5] While at the SEC, he received in August 2004 a Capital Markets Award, related to work in the area of SEC examinations of conflicts of interest.[4] At the end of his tenure, he was Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, and reported to the head of the SEC's inspection program responsible for regulatory oversight of trading on the securities exchanges and ECNs, supervising 8–18 staffers.[1][5][6]
Madoff[edit]




Bernard Madoff


Swanson is the husband of Shana Madoff, who is daughter of Peter Madoff. She is also a niece of Bernard Madoff, who operated a Ponzi scheme that is considered to be the largest financial fraud in U.S. history.[7][8][9] She worked under her father at her uncle's firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BMIS),[8][10] as a rules and compliance officer and attorney.[7][11][12] She reported to her father who was responsible for ensuring that BMIS complied with its legal and regulatory obligations, and signed documents assuring the SEC that BMIS's business records were truthful and accurate.[11][13]
Swanson met Shana Madoff in April 2003.[7][14][15] The two met in 2003 at an industry event during an examination of Bernie Madoff by the SEC as to whether Bernie Madoff was front running customer orders, totally missing the multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme that would be exposed in December 2008. The two had periodic contact thereafter in connection with Mr. Swanson speaking at industry events organized by a SIFMA committee on which Shana Madoff sat. During 2003 Swanson sent Shana's father Peter Madoff two regulatory requests, although by the time of the second request Mr. Swanson's responsibility for the examination had been transfserred to a different Assistant Director at the SEC.[7][16][17][18][19][20]
In February 2006, Swanson was emailed by Assistant Director John Nee that the SEC’s New York Regional Office was investigating a complaint that Bernard Madoff might be running “the biggest Ponzi scheme ever.”[16] In April 2006, Swanson began to date Shana Madoff. Mr. Swanson reported the relationship to his supervisor who wrote in an email "I guess we won't be investigating Madoff anytime soon."[21]
In 2006, the SEC's New York Enforcement Office, of which Mr. Swanson was not a part, closed its investigation of Bernie Madoff. On 15 September 2006, Swanson left the SEC.[7][22] On 8 December 2006, Swanson and Shana Madoff became engaged.[7][23]
In 2009, after the scandal broke, SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz investigated, and concluded that there was no evidence that Swanson's romantic relationship with Shana Madoff influenced the closing of the SEC investigation of Madoff.[24][25][not in citation given] He did conclude, however, that: Swanson's communication with Shana during the period of time he was engaged in a cause examination of her uncle and father's firm, created the appearance of a potential conflict of interest.[21]
The September 29, 2007, wedding between Swanson and Shana Madoff was attended by Lori Richards, the SEC's Director of Compliance Investigations and Examinations, who oversaw the Division in which Mr. Swanson worked at the SEC.[15][21][26][27] In 2008, Bernard Madoff spoke at a business roundtable meeting of his "very close" relationship with an SEC lawyer, and chuckled: "my niece even married one".[28][29] In April 2009, Richards recused herself from the Madoff investigation.[26]
Ameriprise Financial[edit]
Subsequent to working at the SEC, Swanson was a Vice President of regulatory strategy at Ameriprise Financial, a financial services company based in Minnesota.[1][2]
BATS[edit]
Swanson is the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of BATS Global Markets, an electronic stock exchange that is the third-largest stock exchange in the United States, which he joined as General Counsel in January 2008.[1][30] He was hired in part to assist the exchange in its effort to obtain exchange status from the SEC.[1]

What we can learn from Sequoia Capital and the 7 deadly sins
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized05 Jan 2015


A few weeks ago my son, Jeff, mentioned in passing that Sequoia Capital didn’t invest in a startup company unless the founders could identify which of the 7 deadly sins the product or service was appealing to.  Their logic is simple: “We don’t want to invest in something people should want to do. We want... Read More

The Lean Startup for church planters
/eric swanson/1/Uncategorized01 Nov 2014


Over the past few months I’ve been talking with church planters about what we can learn from the startup community about starting new churches. On my last trip out to the San Francisco Bay Area I brought ten copies of Eric Ries’ The Lean Startup and had some great conversations with planters about the soul-bound...

Building a church startup ecosystem in your city
/eric swanson/1/Uncategorized04 Oct 2014


I work in a very creative and entrepreneurial city. Boulder Colorado is a magnet for entrepreneurs and business startups. Little wonder Inc. Magazine recently named Boulder as “America’s startup capital.” Bloomberg’s BusinessWeek named Boulder “the best town for startups.” Even The New York Times fawned over Boulder as a great startup community. And why not? Every... Read More

What if Starbucks wrote your mission statement
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized04 Oct 2014


A couple weeks ago I was speaking to a group of missional city leaders in Oklahoma City and said that I wanted to read our vision for city transformation and began to read. Our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – to bring about a thriving city – one person, one family and... Read More

“You’re doing a good job!”
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized28 Sep 2014


When our oldest son Andy was six we were sitting in church and being the first Sunday of the month Pastor Bob gave an explanation of communion and asked everyone to “examine” him or herself before partaking of the elements. Liz leaned over to explain to Andy what all that meant. “This is a time... Read More

What people want in their city
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized28 Sep 2014


What makes a community a desirable place to live? What makes people happy to live where they live? What attaches a person to his or her city? The Gallup organization and the Knight Foundation launched the Knight Soul of the Community[1] project in 2008 with these questions in mind. They interviewed nearly 43,000 people in...

City transformation as a platform
/eric swanson/1/Uncategorized28 Sep 2014


Maybe you’ve heard the term “platform” thrown around lately. You politely nod your head and mutter, “yea…platform….that’s where it’s at.” But what exactly is a platform? Michael Hyatt says that a platform, at its simplest definition is “a place to stand to be seen or heard.” He goes on to say that the purpose of a platform is to...

How tables builds community
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized22 Jun 2014


Last Saturday Liz, and four friends from work went to TEDx MileHigh. Of course it was a great event but the thing that got the lion’s share of my attention was something called Public Coffee.  Public Coffee defines itself as follows: “Public Coffee is a mobile coffee shop. It visits various neighborhoods throughout Denver to... Read More

What makes Boulder a great tech city
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized10 Jun 2014


A few months ago I read Brad Feld’s The Startup Community: Building an entrepreneurial ecosystem in your city. As I read Feld I couldn’t help but make the connections to what an ecosystem for church startups would look like. Church planters are the entrepreneurs of the kingdom. On a Spirit-led whim, equipped only with vision and... Read More

To Transform a City in Word Cloud
/city, Kingdom, Transformation/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized25 May 2014


Several years ago I attended a one-day seminar on the “Visual Display of Quantitative Information” by Edward Tufte. Tufte’s work is based on the assumption that all quantitative information can be explained visually. To me his most powerful example is Charles Minard’s 1869 depiction of Napoleon’s march on Moscow. Those who know me, know that... Read More

The least missional thing people can do—know the names of our neighbors
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized06 Apr 2014


Most every pastor wants to help people grow and multiply their missional effectiveness as much as they possibly can but what if we flipped the script and tried to help them the least amount possible in order to maximize their chances of living missionally? So what might we do? In Chip and Dan Heath’s best-seller,... Read More

The science and theology of generosity
/eric swanson/1/Uncategorized05 Apr 2014


A couple days ago two young couples came over to our house for some Bible study—nothing too profound. Each time we’ll be together we’ll read through the Proverb that corresponds to the day of the month (in this case Proverbs 3) followed by the study we’ve done on the parables of Jesus (in this case...

Thinking about cities
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized05 Apr 2014


As of May, 2007 more people live in cities than live in rural areas and that trend is never going back. God begins his work in a garden but his work ends in a city. More and more Christian leaders find themselves thinking about…and writing about cities and their place in the city. Some call... Read More

The adjacent possible—the shadow futures around us
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized29 Mar 2014


Imagine, if you will, a simple 9-piece set of Legos that forms a small car—4 wheels, a chassis, a windshield, two axels, and a steering wheel. Try as you might to re-arrange these parts, its hard to form anything but a car. But what could you create if you had 20 pieces…a hundred pieces…a thousand... Read More

Nir Eyal and spiritual growth

On Tuesday Nir hosted the Habit Summit with a stellar line-up of Silicon Valley rock stars from Facebook, Airbnb, Twitter, Expedia, etc. Nir is an expert in human behavior and recently published Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. In my mind it... Read More

Guest Post on Obscurity
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized16 Mar 2014


Centuries ago, in the deserts of Egypt an early Christian mystic scratched a prayer in the sands of the Scetes Dessert. He prayed this powerful prayer but one time and walked away, trusting that the gentle desert breeze would wash the words from this abandoned wasteland. The name of this godly mystic has faded from...

Good ideas in disguise
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized11 Mar 2014


This week at LunchNLearn we watched an insightful 23-minute presentation by Chris Dixon called “Good ideas that look like bad ideas” (GITLLBI). Dixon was speaking to the 2013 class of Y Combinator, a creative start-up funder and incubator in Silicon Valley. Dixon is an entrepreneur and a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz so he sees thousands of... Read More

BJ Fogg and evangelism
/eric swanson/0/Uncategorized02 Mar 2014


One of the recent breakthrough ideas in human behavior comes out of Stanford University. In 2007 Professor B.J. Fogg began teaching what became known as “the Facebook Class.” Students in Fogg’s class developed apps for Facebook and Zinga resulting in products that made students wealthy overnight. These nouveau riche Stanford students could now live a lifestyle that... Read More
