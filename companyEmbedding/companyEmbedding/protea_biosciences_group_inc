Description










 
















Every REDIchip target offers precise, structured nanopost array (NAPA) pillars for dependable MS results. Energy from the UV laser source on MALDI systems is absorbed by the REDIchip's NAPA pillars and is transferred to the sample by resonance-effect. The nanoposts on the REDIchip surface are highly organized and offer exceptional reproducibility in each analysis. NAPA pillar dimensions are optimized for maximum efficiency in energy transfer, resulting in enhanced sample ionization in a matrix-free environment.In traditional matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spec experiments, a chemical matrix is necessary to facilitate molecular ionization for subsequent analysis. MALDI-MS has become a standard technique for a variety of analytical applications, but it is not ideal for small molecule identification due to signal impedance from the matrix. The REDIchip enables small molecule quantitation because of the unique, matrix-free design of the target plate.Nanopost dimensions have been optimized for enhanced ion production via resonance-effect upon interaction of the UV laser with the nanostructures. Laser light confinement effects (field enhancements, high heating rates, prolonged interaction times) promote sample ionization in the nanostructures.

 Protein Gel Stains 



  Reviews Description     0 Scientists have reviewed this product Write the First Review No Reviews Protea’s Protein Gel Stains offer excellent sensitivity for visualizing intact proteins separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis.For general protein visualization and quantitation by densitometry, SuperBlue Coomassie Stains are the industry’s choice for quick staining and accurate results. SuperBlue Coomassie Stains are sensitive down to 20-40 ng and are available in both colloidal (G250) and traditional (R250) formulations.For even greater sensitivity, Protea’s Silver Stain and ZincPlus Stain Kits offer detection limits down 1 ng. Complimentary to the Silver Stain Kit which offers a traditional staining method, Protea’s ZincPlus Stains are negative gel stains which provide for effective protein visualization without compromising subsequent down-stream analysis. No fixation step is required when using the ZincPlus Stain Kit, and protein bands within a gel remain clear on a whitish-opaque background. Each of the SuperBlue Coomassie and ZincPlus Stains are fully compatible with the GPR-850 Gel Protein Recovery System, and the Silver Stain Kit is designed to offer excellent results with direct MALDI analysis.Features:

Wide range of detection 
Diverse applications 
Traditional and negative stains 
SuperBlue Coomassie Stain reacts stoichiometrically with proteins 
Silver Stain and ZincPlus Stain are highly sensitive and interchangeable 
Research Applications:

Visualization of proteins after 1D or 2D gel electrophoresis 
Visualization of proteins separated on IPG strips 
Protein quantitation of gel separated proteins by densitometry 
Protein Gel Stains:

SuperBlue Coomassie Stain, G250 (SB-G250) 
SuperBlue Coomassie Stain, R250 (SB-R250) 
Silver Stain Kit (SS-100)

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
