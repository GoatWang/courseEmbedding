Description




The Journey of Shine
It all started with a creative spark that was ignited deep within my heart. That one moment seeded the full blossoming of this album, “Shine.”
As the heart connected journey of this creation unfolded, each song became a musical bridge infused with specific and powerful intentions and attunements that allowed me to be guided safely over unchartered waters into completion. BRIDGE is the key word. A bridge from New Age to Now Age, a bridge from Sacred Sound into Pop music, a bridge from the Mind to the Heart and a bridge from Darkness into Light. It is still amazing to me that just one spark can bring incredible light to the darkness. You and I are that spark and it is time for all of us to Shine! Allow, “Shine” to be a vehicle of light on your own unique journey to the promise of all that you truly are!
From my heart to yours,
Barry Goldstein
Thanks and Gratitude
I would like to sincerely thank my family, extended family, friends, and peeps that provide me with constant love and support as I embark upon new and exciting journeys. I would also like to thank Donese for her wisdom, beauty, and laughter, and for teaching me that “Gold” is found in the heart.
