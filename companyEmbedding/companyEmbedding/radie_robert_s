During his tenure at Eli Lilly he managed several successful product launches and led national sales forces, most recently as the director of sales for Eli Lilly’s critical care division. He also contributed to the shaping of Eli Lilly’s reimbursement strategy which was designed to ensure that hospital products gained timely formulary approval. Prior to that, as director of sales for Eli Lilly’s diabetes top performing business unit, Mr. Radie launched three new products, including Actos® and Humalog Mix 75/25®, and led a significant expansion of that sales force. He also played an important role in the launch of Prozac® and Zyprexa®, Eli Lilly’s two leading neuroscience drugs. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Boston College.
