 One Company Serving Clients Around The World.
























1T. Rowe Price ranked third in the Securities and Asset Management Industry category. The survey started with approximately 1,500 companies: the FORTUNE 1,000® (the 1,000 largest U.S. companies ranked by revenue), plus non-U.S. companies in FORTUNE’s Global 500® database with revenue of $10 billion U.S. dollars or more. The companies were then sorted by industry, and the 15 largest for each international industry and the 10 largest for each U.S. industry were selected. A total of 680 companies from 28 countries were surveyed. To create the 51 industry lists, Hay Group (FORTUNE® survey partner) asked executives, directors, and securities analysts to rate companies in their own industry on 9 criteria, from investment value and quality of management and products to social responsibility and ability to attract talent. A company’s score must rank in the top half of its industry survey to be listed.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
