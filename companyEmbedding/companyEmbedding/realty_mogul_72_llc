Realty Mogul hits $3 million in funding just 4 months into crowdfunding









CrowdFundBeat News: Realty Mogul, a real estate crowdfunding site, has just announced that it crossed the $3 million mark yesterday, after surpassing the $2 million at the end of June. The site is a marketplace for accredited investors to pool money online and buy shares of pre-vetted real estate investments.
For a company that is bracing a relatively new concept in the real estate investing industry, Realty Mogul is experiencing an outstanding year. The company has already grabbed first place in 2 highly recognized competitions for startup companies. Earlier this year in March, Realty Mogul beat 50 other companies and came in first at the Founder Showcase competition. Not only that, Realty Mogul went home with top honors in the HATCH Pitch Competition at SXSW triumphing over 100 other applicants. It is also a finalists for the Innotribe SWIFT event that will take place in mid-Septemberof this year; one of its toughest competitions yet.

A Los Angeles based company, Realty Mogul has since extended its offerings to include transactions from Seattle, Washington, Tennessee, Texas and Kansas. However, investors are free to participate from anywhere and the company will be gradually expanding. Partnerships with professional companies such as AH Capital, Dimension Investment Group, and Real Property Funding has allowed Realty Mogul to be one of the best real estate investing companies in a variety of markets.
Right now, due to the sensitivity of SEC rulings, Realty Mogul is focusing on accredited investors. To qualify, an individual will need to have an income of more than $200,000 annually or have a net worth of more than $1 million in liquid assets. However, Realty Mogul is looking forward to the Title III of JOBS Act to come out whereby it can start to solicit investments from the mass affluent. Realty Moguls website allows you to browse a marketplace of different investments, sign legal documentation securely online and fund online.  Investments are only made when the goal of the total funding is reached. Then, tracking your investments is going to be a piece of cake by looking at the investor dashboard.
One of Realty Mogul’s biggest goals is to build trust among its investors. Therefore, they try to keep their real estate deals as transparent as possible. However, the protection and safety of the investors will always be their first priority.

Realty Mogul Adds to Executive Team with Hire of Kendra King
 Tweet44 Share Share27 +11 Reddit Pin EmailShares 72

January 16, 2015 @ 9:20 am By JD Alois 


Realty Mogul real estate investment platform has hired Kendra King as a Senior Vice President of Mortgage Lending. King previously had acted as a consultant to Realty Mogul and had aided in the development of its online borrower application process.  King is said to be skilled at implementing lending and mortgage underwriting operations.  King previously was Director of Credit Risk at Charles Schwab Bank and also held a senior management position at MBNA America Bank and Pacific Shore Funding.
King was quoted on her recent appointment;
“I’m so happy to be able to be in a position to contribute to the development of Realty Mogul’s online lending platform,” said King.  “This company is really picking up the pace in business-purpose mortgage lending, and borrowers have clearly been appreciative of the simplified processes that technology enables.  In addition to our future development efforts, I expect to be working with the large number of financial institutions and investors that are interested in purchasing Realty Mogul originated loans.  The peer-to-peer real estate marketplace is here to stay, and I’m proud to join Realty Mogul in a role where I can improve its lending products and facilitate the growth of the real estate lending marketplace industry generally.”
Founder and CEO of Realty Mogul Jilliene Hellman commented on the new hire;
“We’re thrilled to have Kendra leading the charge to make Realty Mogul a more borrower-friendly, technology driven lending platform,” said Helman.  “Her prior experience includes product management roles with lending institutions and fits well with our goal at Realty Mogul to develop a comprehensive real estate lending platform with a refreshingly delightful user experience.  We’re proud to have Kendra on our team.”
Realty Mogul is an accredited crowdfunding platform that offers both debt and equity in real estate investments. An early adopter to the real estate crowdfunding space, Realty Mogul has raised over $47 million for 175 properties.  Real estate and crowdfunding, leveraging technology to facilitate the investment process, is a natural marriage.  Realty Mogul has captured headlines as it has quickly pushed into a space that has traditionally been dominated by families and institutional money.  Today accredited investors may participate in investment opportunities side by side with institutional funds.
Realty  Mogul has quickly grown its executive staff and continues to seek new hires to boost its platform growth.

Crowdfunding company Realty Mogul likes what it sees in Kansas, Tennessee









CFB visits Realty Mogul Team in Los Angeles, CA
Not too many commercial real estate companies can say they’ve been featured in TechCrunch, the techhiest of all tech Web sites. But Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Realty Mogul has, thanks to its unique idea of allowing investors to pool their money online to buy shares of pre-vetted commercial real estate investments. The founders of Realty Mogul call this “crowdfunding.”
And now the minds behind Realty Mogul are taking their company into the Midwest, expanding into Kansas and Tennessee by offering investors the chance to pool their money and put it into commercial properties in these two strong markets.
To date, Realty Mogul has closed on 18 properties for a total of more than $16.3 million. Investors have invested more than $3.3 million with Realty Mogul so far. That’s impressive considering that all this activity has taken place in the last five months.
“There is a lot of interest in what we are doing,” said Jilliene Helman, founder and chief executive officer of Realty Mogul. “People like the idea of being able to invest in a real, tangible asset like a commercial property. I prefer that to investing in paper-assets. Unlike with stocks and bonds, you have the ability to feel and see your investment. That adds value to it.”
Kansas and Tennessee — especially the Memphis market — made sense for Realty Mogul thanks to the lack of volatility there, Helman said.
“Even in the economic downturn, housing prices in those markets stayed relatively stable,” Helman said. “There are long-term growth opportunities in both of those markets.”
Now Realty Mogul has closed on commercial properties in four states: Tennessee, Kansas, California and Washington. In Kansas, Realty Mogul closed on a 72-unit apartment building in Ogden on the outskirts of the Fort Riley army base.
Realty Mogul is now looking at other states to enter, most notably Texas.
For Helman, who previously worked in the wealth-management industry, the potential for growth doesn’t end with Lone Star state, either. When she looks to the future, she sees a steady stream of new investors working with Realty Mogul to buy shares of high-performing commercial properties.
“There are so many benefits to investing in a group,” Helman said. “You gain access to investments that you otherwise would not have access to. You also get passive investments. You don’t have to actively manage that investment. You don’t have the hassle of clogged toilets, trash pickup or maintenance. It gives investors the chance to invest in commercial property while avoiding the hassle of worrying about property maintenance.”
