Xcr Diagnostics  $2.00 million  Fundraising. William C Olson  Filed Dec 7  Filing


12/08/2015  by OctaStaff 
			in Private Financing News 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Xcr Diagnostics  $2.00 million  Fundraising. William C Olson  Filed Dec 7  Filing and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/xcr-diagnostics-2-00-million-fundraising-william-c-olson-filed-dec-7-filing/306898/.CaptchaSubmit
Xcr Diagnostics Financing
Xcr Diagnostics Inc, Corporation just filed form D regarding $2.00 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Xcr Diagnostics Inc is expected to sell $2.00 million in this financing offer. The total financing amount was $2.00 million. The fundraising form was filed on 2015-12-07. The reason for the financing was: Plus 400,000 shares of Issuer’s stock. The fundraising still has about $2.00 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Xcr Diagnostics is based in Utah. The firm’s business is Biotechnology. The D form was filed by William C Olson Chief Executive Officer. The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 2700 Homestead Road Suite 50, Park City, Ut, Utah, 84098. William C Olson is the related person in the form and it has address: 2700 Homestead Road, Suite 50, Park City, Ut, Utah, 84098. Link to Xcr Diagnostics Filing: 000165692115000001.
Analysis of Xcr Diagnostics Offering
On average, companies in the Biotechnology sector, sell 73.77 % of the total offering amount. Xcr Diagnostics sold 0.00 % of the offering. The fundraising is still open. The average investment offering size for companies in the Biotechnology industry is $3.08 million. The offering was 100.00 % smaller than the average of $3.08 million. Of course this should not be seen as negative. Startups raise funds for different reasons and needs. The minimum investment for this offering is set at $20000. If you know more about the reasons for the financing, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Xcr Diagnostics Also
The Form D signed by William C Olson might help Xcr Diagnostics Inc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.

Fluoresentric Transfers XCR Portable Diagnostic System (PDS) IP To XCR Dx Subsidiary   











Tweet

Award-Winning Diagnostics Brings Near Patient Testing One Step Closer




SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fluoresentric, Inc. today announced the transfer of ownership of 
      intellectual property and product development rights for its XCRTM
Portable 
      Diagnostic System (PDS) to its instrument subsidiary company, XCR 
      Diagnostic’s (XCR Dx). XCR Dx’s PDS prototype development, based on its 
      patent pending instrument technology, suggests this will be the first 
      hand-held molecular diagnostic system to deliver sub 15-minute 
      clinically actionable results at near patient, point of care.
    
“We expect this new 
      instrument to reduce turnaround time and deliver near patient, 
      point-of-care, clinically relevant results at 5 to 10 times the speed of 
      traditional PCR. This points the way for the industry as we all work 
      toward better, more affordable healthcare.”

      “Although our patented XCR chemistry is fully compatible with existing 
      laboratory PCR instruments, XCR Dx’s PDS is designed to optimize the 
      speed, portability and low cost advantages of these revolutionary 
      reagents,” states XCR Dx’s COO Mark Powelson. “We expect this new 
      instrument to reduce turnaround time and deliver near patient, 
      point-of-care, clinically relevant results at 5 to 10 times the speed of 
      traditional PCR. This points the way for the industry as we all work 
      toward better, more affordable healthcare.”
    

      The new system uses the revolutionary patented XCR™ amplification and 
      detection chemistry pioneered by XCR Dx’s Chief Science Officer, Brian 
      Caplin. The PDS employs a combination of proprietary sample preparation 
      chemistry and rapid amplification chemistry to achieve these industry 
      firsts.
    

      “XCR results are attained without interference of non-specific product, 
      a traditional nemesis in PCR,” states Caplin. “This means current PCR 
      users can achieve more reliable results on their instruments. Therefore, 
      our award-winning patented technology improves both DNA and RNA 
      molecular tests throughout the installed base of PCR platforms.”
    

      Fluoresentric’s President and CEO, William Olson stated, “We are very 
      pleased to have XCR Dx own this intellectual property. The team over 
      there is focused and prepared to deliver an industry first, lighting 
      fast instrumentation and chemistry that brings to market the first new 
      molecular diagnostic innovation in nearly 30 years.” Olson continues, 
      “Being an Intellectual Property house, Fluoresentric looks forward to 
      other exciting opportunities to partner with and license our IP.”
    

      The XCR Dx PDS may be seen at the November AMP 
      Annual Meeting in Austin, Texas (booth #1824).
