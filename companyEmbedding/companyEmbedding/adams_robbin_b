FAQs

FAQs

Frequently Asked Questions



How do I take the Detox Trio?

Start with three one half dropper full mixed into an ounce of water on an empty stomach (detox and parasite).
Do this for 3 weeks and rest 1 week. For women, it is best to take the time off when menstruating begins. If you no longer get a menstrual cycle, then pick one week each month to take off.
The colon cleansers are to be taken no more than 3-4 times a week. Start with 2-3 capsules preferably before dinner with a large glass of water and you should eliminate the next morning. By noon, if you see no difference then the next evening take 4-5 with another large glass of water. Continue to increase until you see a difference. If you need more than 6 capsules, then separate them, for example take 4 in the morning and another 3 or 4 in the evening before dinner.
It is important to drink a glass of water every hour so that you do not cramp and to ensure a smooth movement.





How long should I stay on the Detox Trio?

We recommend at least 3-4 months or longer and repeat every other month or when symptoms reappear.  You must remember that cleaning and eliminate parasites and their eggs does not happen over night.  Be patient and this cleanse will give you the optimum health you have been looking for along with better eating and exercise.





I have a difficult time swallowing pills.  Is there another way to the take the colon capsules?

Yes, you can open 2-3 and pour into a cup of hot water and add a little honey and lemon. The next morning if you see no difference then increase to 3-4 or 4-5. If you see that you need more than 5 capsules, then take 3 in the morning and 3 in the evening.





Is there a special diet to follow while on the detox trio?

We recommend avoiding the following:

Sugar, even foods that contain corn syrup (this is a hidden danger found in all processed foods)
Sodas
Sweet drinks
Juices, especially processed juices
Fried foods, only in moderation, cooked only in olive or coconut oil
Corn
White flour products such as bread, pasta, pancakes, bagel, cookies, muffins, breakfast sandwiches, etc.

 
Eat as much as you like of the following:

Green fresh veggies
Salads
Grass fed meat and chicken
Nitrate free bacon
Organic eggs
Fresh fruit
Avocado
Olives
Water, especially alkaline water






Can I take the Detox Trio and DropSlim together?

Yes, take the trio first then take the drop slim with a large glass of water. Wait 20 minutes before having a healthy breakfast. Make sure to try to follow the foods as suggested with the detox trio plan.





What if I have high blood pressure, can I take the trio and drop slim?
I always suggest that you check with your doctor first.




How do I take the Renu Silica if I have high blood pressure?
Check with your doctor first. I recommend that you start with ¼ teaspoon stirred into a glass of water. Make sure to check your pressure a few minutes after drinking.  If you pressure is ok, then after a few days you can increase to ½ teaspoon. Continue this process until you reach 1 teaspoon once to twice a day.
Recommendation:
Make sure to drink at least 6 glasses of water a day while taking the silica powder. Since this product helps to pulls toxins from your system it may pull too fast and cause a spike in blood pressure due to eliminating toxins too quickly. The water will help to keep your system hydrated and moist. If constipation does occur, then take the colon cleansers and reduce your silica intake to half.





How do I take the Renu Silica if I am healthy but I want to grow my hair and nails?
Start with 1 spoonful twice a day.




Can I take the Renu Silica for achy joints?
Yes, one spoon once to twice a day if you are not on blood pressure medication. If so, then follow the recommendation for those on blood pressure mediation. Make sure to speak with your doctor first.




Which products can I take while nursing or pregnant?
None of our detox products can be taken while pregnant or nursing. If your doctor says its okay to take a stool softener, then you can take the colon cleanser once or twice a week.  If your baby develops diarrhea then discontinue.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
