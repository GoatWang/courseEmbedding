 TWO RIVERS WATER & FARMING COMPANY (OTCMKTS:TURV) Files An 8-K Regulation FD DisclosureITEM 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
The information in this Item 7.01 of this Current Report is furnished to Item 7.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for any purpose, including for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
Two Rivers Water & Farming Company, through its subsidiary Water Redevelopment Company, has begun a pilot program to deliver agricultural (ag) water to outdoor marijuana growers in the HCIC ditch system service area.
There is additional water demand in the area from users that do not have proper ditches and measuring devices to receive water through our system. Our ditch supervisor recognized this as a potential market and after clearing it with the local water commissioner, approached users in the area and discovered a need for ag water to be delivered on site by us.
A surplus tanker trailer (pictured above) was leased to the company for the sum of $1/ year by a Two Rivers' board member to be used in the pilot program. The first load of water was delivered on June 30, 2017.
In addition, our ditch supervisor recognized a market for local cattle producers needing water. We are in the process of securing agreements for water delivery to them. 
With thisyears' snow melt and rainrunoff, after supplying the above demand, wehave enough water to provide additional ag water to other users within our service area in Pueblo County.

GCP1 leased 52,500 square feet of its greenhouse to its first tenant on December 1, 2016, with monthly rent payments accruing from December 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017. As of July 1, 2017, the first actual monthly lease payments plus an additional amount of 1/24th of the accrued rent, became due and has been paid. 
GCP1 leased the remaining 52,500 square feet of greenhouse space to a second tenant on March 1, 2017. Under the terms of this lease, monthly rent payments accrue from March 1, 2017 to October 30, 2017. On November 1, 2017 the tenant will begin to pay monthly rent plus 1/24th of the accrued rent. 
GrowCo, Inc. ("GrowCo"), a subsidiary of Two Rivers, is helping a second affiliate, GrowCo Partners 2, LLC, to construct another 105,000 square foot greenhouse and associated warehouse located on the same grow campus as GCP1's facility in southeast Colorado.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
