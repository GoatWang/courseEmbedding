Drive assistance device, wheelchair and method for determination of the physical efficiency and muscular effort data of a wheelchair driver



Patent number:  8641070
                                            

Abstract:  A drive assistance device for a wheelchair includes a drive motor, a running wheel and a sensor device which is adapted to determine a driving force manually induced into the running wheel; and a control unit which is adapted to control the drive motor for driving the running wheel depending on the driving force manually induced by the user into the running wheel. The control unit of the drive assistance device includes a user force analysis operational mode which is adapted to determine data concerning physical efficiency and capacity of the user. These include a maximum force of the user as well as the maximum speed which can be reached with purely manual drive.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

ELYRIA, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Invacare Corporation (NYSE:IVC) today announced the appointment of Ralf 
      Ledda to Senior Vice President and General Manager, Europe, Middle East 
      and Africa effective November 1, 2016. Mr. Ledda has over 20 years of 
      proven leadership experience at Alber GmbH, Invacare’s German-based 
      subsidiary that specializes in innovative electromotive technology and 
      power add-on devices used with medical and recreational products. Most 
      recently, he was the managing director of Alber.

      Ralf has been successful creating an enterprise-wide culture of quality, 
      innovation and customer service excellence. He is well-regarded among 
      our strong European team. Ralf has demonstrated the ability to drive 
      growth, manage a continuous pipeline of novel products through 
      development, and lead a stimulating culture. By becoming the general 
      manager of Europe, Ralf will be in a position to shape the segment in 
      these same areas for many years,'' said Matthew E. Monaghan, chairman, 
      president and chief executive officer of Invacare.
    

      Mr. Ledda joined Alber in 1995. He assumed responsibility for the

      Invacare. During his tenure, he has been responsible for all aspects of 
      the company’s operations including overseeing the launch of many 
      innovative devices, including the current Alber® Scalamobil® 
      stairclimbing systems, multiple power assist devices for manual 
      wheelchairs, and Neodrive® technology for e-bicycles. As part 
      of Invacare’s ongoing transformation to focus on clinically complex and 
      post-acute care, the company continues to expand the availability of 
      Alber products.
    

      Mr. Ledda has a degree in industrial engineering from the University of 
      Munich. Prior to joining Alber, Mr. Ledda worked at Siemens AG.
    

      Invacare Corporation (NYSE:IVC), headquartered in Elyria, Ohio, is a
