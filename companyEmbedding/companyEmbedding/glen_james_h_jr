Review This Product













            
                Warning: This book will create marvelous messes and changes in your worship! So writes an enthusiastic reviewer of Ritchie's latest book about how the generations (particularly, the younger ones) experience worship. Authentic worship happens when the full community is together. Yes, that includes wiggling, loud-whispering, sometimes crying kids. Always in Rehearsal lays a foundation for including all God's children in worship and provides a wealth of ideas for implementing this approach in your congregation. "... [F]or me, the presence of children in worship signals God's presence as well," Ritchie writes. "I've learned to listen to the voices of the children carefully, thoughtfully, devotionally because they speak for people who stand on the periphery of faith, craving something memorable and something to draw them into community." In Always in Rehearsal, Ritchie explains: a new approach for incorporating children into the worshipping community ways to welcome, accommodate, and celebrate all persons in worship ideas to help your congregation (including children) find themselves drawn into a deeper awareness of God's loving presenceAs the reviewer continued, "Jim's love of children and his deep passion for preparing them in faith comes through loud and clear. This book includes hundreds of ideas that any congregation can do."

Due to Indianas minimal regulation regarding contractor licensing, consumers should be extra vigilant when hiring contractors, check on BuildZoom for customer reviews, and permit history as indicators of quality businesses.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Indiana, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
