Achieve Productivity when Working from Home
We in the final expense insurance game often need to work from home, and it can be frustrating to do so when we’re wrestling with productivity. Home is where we are used to relaxing and focusing on our families, it is difficult to shift gears and focus on work in […]

Pros and Cons to Cremation

Company Information

Corporate Governance | Corporate Officers | Company Growth | Map of our Companies


The roots of our Company were planted deep in 1965 with the founding of Security National Life Insurance Company. Starting with only $543,000 in assets, in a small rented house in Salt Lake City, Utah, Security National has grown into a strong industry leader in several fields of service.
Over the past four decades we have grown consistently through new sales and investment opportunities, and through the acquisition of life insurance companies, funeral homes and cemeteries, as well as the formation and growth of our mortgage operations.
