25% maximum per industry
Strategy can allocate up to 50% to emerging markets debt and up to 40% to non-dollar-denominated securities

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot

        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

							Overview						


ETF Objective
Janus SG Global Quality Income ETF (SGQI) seeks investment results that correspond generally, before fees and expenses, to the performance of the SGI Global Quality Income Index.
Client Commitment
An Equity ETF seeking to provide investors with a consistent income stream by selecting quality, high-yielding companies across the globe. In today’s low-yielding environment, this may serve as an important complement to fixed income, offering both a diversified source of income and growth potential.
Why Invest in the Fund


Equity Income Potential

The strategy seeks to invest in dividend-paying companies with yields above 4%, pursuing the best opportunities in global developed market equities.

Quality Counts

The strategy aims to provide a consistent income stream by selecting quality companies with the potential to sustain or grow dividend payouts by evaluating balance sheet strength, profitability and price stability.

Core Income Complement

This may serve as a diversifier in an income portfolio providing both a differentiated stream of income and growth potential – especially important given the scarcity of yield in today’s market.

									Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns and principal value will vary; there may be a gain or loss when shares are sold.
									Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns.

HIGH YIELD INVESTMENTS
High yield investments offer additional income, but high returns go hand in hand with greater risks. Too many people get caught up in the yield, as if it was free money. It's not.When you evaluate investments that appear to pay more you should approach them like Sherlock Holmes, with a healthy degree of skepticism as there are realistic cause and effect relationships. The return is higher because the risk is higher. Be sure to question everything and pay attention to the details.Doing your detective work means knowing how the high yield investment generates its returns and what factors would cause those returns to go down (or up.) You should only consider buying after you understand these factors such as financial operating condition, industry competitors, and overall economic conditions.Yields which are significantly higher than safer alternatives like treasury securities (which are backed by the U.S. government).Start your search for yield with the list below. Just don't forget, although they may generate a significant amount of monthly (or quarterly) income, with high yield investments, expect your principal to fluctuate, sometimes drastically. High yield bondsHigh yield bonds are issued by companies whose financial strength is not rock solid. Often referred to as "junk bonds," they must pay a higher yield than other safer alternatives in order to attract investors. You can buy individual high yield bonds, but most investors would find high yield bond mutual funds to be a more attractive and diversified option. Real estate investment trusts (REITs)Think of a REIT like a mutual fund that owns real estate. The REIT then passes along the rental income from that real estate to you, the investor. REITs can be publicly traded or private, and may own a broad portfolio of real estate or a narrow one. Through REITS you can invest in apartments, hotels, office space, retail space, healthcare related properties, mortgages, storage and other types of real estate related property. Preferred stocksTechnically a preferred stock is an equity investment, but they often get compared to bonds as they are highly interest rate sensitive. Preferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed rate and a company is required to pay dividends to their preferred stock holders before a single penny gets paid out to common stock holders. This feature can make them an attractive source of high yield investment income. Municipal BondsIf you’re in a high tax bracket, consider a closed-end fund that owns municipal bonds. Nearly all such funds use borrowed money to boost income. One that doesn’t is Nuveen Municipal Value Fund (NUV, $10, 4.4%), which mostly buys high-quality, long-term bonds. Although at first glance the fund’s yield seems to disqualify it from this group, you really need to look at its taxable-equivalent yield—what someone would have to earn from a taxable bond to equal the yield of a tax-free bond. In this case, 4.4% is the equivalent of a 6.1% taxable yield for someone in the 28% federal tax bracket and 7.3% for an investor in the top 39.6% bracket. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)The U.S. Treasury has several types of bond investments for you to choose from. One of the lowest risk is called a Treasury Inflation Protection Security or TIPS. These bonds come with two methods of growth.The first is a fixed interest rate that doesn’t change for the length of the bond. The second is built-in inflation protection that is guaranteed by the government. Whatever rate inflation grows during the time you hold the TIPS, your investment’s value rises with that rate.For example, say you invest in a TIPS today that only comes with a 0.35% interest rate. That’s less than certificate of deposit rates and even basic online savings accounts. This isn’t very enticing until you realize that, if inflation grows a 2% per year for the length of the bond, then your investment value increases with that inflation, and gives you a much higher return on your investment. TIPS can be purchased individually or you can invest in a mutual fund that owns in a basket of TIPS.
