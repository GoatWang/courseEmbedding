Patient rights, HIPAA, Advance directives
Patient rights at Medical Center of the Rockies and Poudre Valley Hospital
You enjoy many rights as a hospital patient.

MCR Patient Rights Brochure
MCR Patient Rights Brochure en Español

Privacy (HIPAA) and your information
At your request we keep information about your hospital stay private and confidential, as required by federal law (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA).
One way we maintain your privacy is to set up a special password at your request. You tell us this password, which you may share with friends and family so they can find out how you’re doing. When callers give us your password, we can update them on your progress. If callers don’t know the password, we cannot tell them anything about your condition.
We’ll write your password on a note card for you to keep.
Advance directives
We can help you complete a Living Will or other advance directive at your preadmission appointment. These legal documents spell out the care you want — or don’t want — in case you cannot make your own decisions and communicate them to us.
If you decide to complete an advance directive while you’re in the hospital, just ask your nurse to make arrangements.



Patient safety and care at MCR
Patient safety and well being is our primary concern. Poudre Valley Hospital and Medical Center of the Rockies embraces patient – and family-centered care and encourages you to participate in your care and help us as much as you can.

Our staff members will wash their hands before examining you. Regular hand-washing is the best way to prevent infections.
We will routinely double-check your name and wristband before giving you medicine, tests and procedures.
More patients than you might think have a high risk of falling, which can cause injury. If you are at risk for falling, a staff member will help you in the bathroom. Many falls in hospitals take place in the bathroom, and we want to keep you safe and healthy.
We will check your vital signs regularly, even at night. We promote rest and sleep, but we also need to wake you for check-ups requested by your doctor. We want to make sure you are safe and doing well.

For your safety
Our security staff is here for you. If you’re coming and going from the hospital late at night and would like an escort to your vehicle, ask your nurse to contact our officers.

I recommend this place to anyone who needs to repair auto wiring.Alan Jones Real Estate Incshabadage ratedAlan made selling our home easy and quick, and got us into the perfect new home!Did You Know?There has perhaps never been a better tool for do-it-yourself home handymen than the internet. With detailed instructions and videos explaining how to perform a number of common maintenance and renovation tasks around a house, an untrained homeowner might be surprised at how much he or she can accomplish with a quick search online. But even with all of this information, there are still many jobs that lie far outside the scope of most DIY enthusiasts. General contractors are there to fill in this gap.A general contractor specializes in seeing a home remodel or repair project through from start to finish. To do this, the contractor works with the client - whether they are a homeowner or business - to nail down the scope of the work. Then he or she will turn to one or more subcontractors for specific tasks, like equipment operation, design, electrical work or whatever else is needed.In essence, general contractors could be thought of as middlemen between a homeowner or business owner and any number of specialists. To get their money's worth, many assume they should just "cut out the middleman" and hire specialists directly, but this often proves more difficult in practice. General contractors won't be completing an entire project by themselves, but should have a long list of dependable experts who can work together and accomplish any task. They might also serve as the manager on the site of a construction project, overseeing workers and providing guidance and assistance when needed. For larger projects, though, the contractor might only handle administrative matters and employ a foreman or other professional for on-site supervision.Common JobsThere are many general contractors who also specialize in certain tasks themselves. There is usually at least one general contractor on hand to organize the construction of an entire home, for example. But general contractors could also help a homeowner add an additional bedroom, build an in-ground pool or complete a major landscaping project. They could also work with a business to add or improve office space, whether that means making more room or converting a commercial building from a nail salon to a restaurant. Basically, if it's a job that involves building or repairing, a general contractor probably knows how to get it done.No matter what the exact job may be, a contractor will probably need to accomplish several other essential tasks in pursuit of the ultimate goal, which may include:Understanding and applying for building permits to meet local regulationsOrganizing a budget and adhering to it throughout the projectGathering all the necessary tools and equipment, from hammers and shovels to large excavators and generatorsSecuring the construction site and equipment after work hoursWorking with personnel on-site to address any issuesKeeping records of materials, labor and all other expensesLicensingEvery general contractor performing any kind of work on a project must be licensed to do so in their state. The guidelines for the specifics on licensing vary from state to state. Some states might only require registration of contractors, which is different from licensing. Registration typically means that there must be a written record of what work is being performed and by whom, but it does not guarantee professional knowledge. Licensing, on the other hand, involves an examination process to assess professional competence.Whether your state requires licensing or registration of contractors, there should be a record of most professionals willing to complete certain projects in your area. Check your state or county website for more information. In states that require licensing, every licensed contractor's contact information is available online or from another public source.Not every project needs to be completed by a licensed or registered contractor. If it's just a minor job that won't take more than a day or two, and will cost less than a few hundred dollars, it's likely not necessary to find a licensed or registered contractor. However, anything bigger or more expensive, or a project involving plumbing or electrical work, needs to be completed by a licensed or registered professional.General contractors also must be covered by an insurance policy. This should include liability coverage for any property damage that could be inflicted in the course of a job. It should also include a worker's compensation policy in case anyone is injured on the job. Before hiring a contractor for anything, ask for written proof of this insurance to see exactly what is covered. Trade AssociationsA number of trade associations for contractors in the U.S. exist. Some of the biggest include:Associated General Contractors of America: Represents more than 6,500 general contracting firms and more than 9,000 specialty contractors nationwide.Associated Builders and Contractors: Represents non-union contracting firms.Most trade associations for general contractors will provide references for anyone looking to hire a contractor for a specific project. They may also provide a number of benefits for their members, including assistance with licensing, training, insurance and business development.Hiring a General ContractorNo matter what you need accomplished, you want to choose a contractor who can get the job done right at a reasonable price. Obviously, this is easier said than done, but there are a few steps you can take to ensure you find a trustworthy general contractor.Finding general contractorsThe first, and perhaps most reliable, way to find a general contractor is to ask friends and family members for a recommendation. If you know anyone who has had major work done on their home, particularly if it's a similar job, ask them who they hired and if they were pleased with the result. You could also ask neighbors about who they've hired if you notice work being done on their house. Many remodeling contractors post signs in front of homes to advertise their services. As a general rule, it's rarely a good idea to hire a contractor who solicits work by going door to door.If you are considering hiring a contractor without a personal recommendation, ask the contractor for references from past clients, and do as much background research on them as possible. Look for any complaints (or compliments) online to get a better idea of their track record. There are a number of websites specializing in connecting contractors with people or businesses who need work done. These sites may also allow past clients to submit their own reviews of the contractor. BudgetBefore hiring a contractor, make sure you are both in agreement on the project's budget. It's normal for most contractors to charge clients a premium not only for the labor expenses and zoning expertise, but for acquiring the materials as well. Be as clear and concise as possible regarding what you'll be purchasing yourself and what you will be paying the contractor to complete. Homeowners may be able to find a better deal on raw materials when they purchase these directly, but they first need to be sure they aren't buying the wrong things.Don't forget to discuss how the project will be finalized and what will be done about cleanup. Plans for how the work site will be cleaned at the end of each day as well as at the conclusion of work need to be put in writing. An experienced general contractor should make every effort to keep the workspace clean and prevent dirtying or damaging any other area. Even so, talk with the contractor about the daily schedule, the logistics of transporting workers and equipment, and how cleanup will be handled.Prioritizing SafetyAs previously mentioned, you need to make sure to follow any state and local regulations regarding construction work, which includes hiring a licensed or registered general contractor. Ask the contractor for proof of their certification before signing anything, as well as their proof of insurance. You should also check your homeowners insurance policy to see if they offer coverage for contracted work. You may want to call your insurance provider and ask for more details on what your plan will and won't cover.Perhaps the best way to feel safe about a contractor and the work being done is to hire a contractor you trust. This is why relying on personal references from friends and family is so important, and will often provide a great deal of peace of mind. If you aren't able to obtain a reference, work to conduct extensive research on the contractor as well as the work you are hiring them to perform. This should bring everyone's expectations into alignment and result in a safe work environment.Financial safetyBefore any money changes hands, there should be a contract to sign. Make sure the specifics of the work to be done and all costs are listed in the contract, right down to the most precise details. If you forget to have something included in the contract after signing it, there's rarely a chance of recourse. Once the specifics of the job are nailed down, be sure to discuss the payment schedule with the contractor. This is important because paying too much up front offers the homeowner minimal leverage if the quality of work does not meet expectations or contractual specifications. Try to establish a reasonable pay schedule with the contractor, such as paying 10 percent of the total cost for each 10 percent of the work that is completed. It's a good idea to include this payment plan in the contract as well.Finally, look into getting a lien release signed before work begins. If there is ever a dispute regarding payment over the course of the project, a contractor or subcontractor could place a payment claim, or lien, on your property. This can trigger a long legal process that may be frustrating. To avoid this, ask the contractor to sign a lien release, which is a legal agreement that states that any payment accepted is final. This can come in handy if a contractor has his or her own payment issues with their subcontractors. Signing a lien release form certifies that any payment made by a client to the contractor is enough to pay for any goods or services rendered. A lien dispute could also be prevented by performing due diligence prior to picking a contractor, as any contractor with good credit and a long track record of satisfied clients should have no trouble paying for materials and labor once all contract conditions have been met.Once work is underway, it's never a bad idea to check up on the progress of the job, either by staying in touch with the contractor over the phone or visiting the site in person. If you work with a trustworthy professional, it's probably best to keep your distance and allow everyone to stay busy. If you want to keep an eye on things, make sure workers wear the right safety gear and that everything looks to be moving along according to schedule. Finally, once work is finished and you are satisfied, be sure to thank your contractor and tell friends or family members about your experience.

Colorado Rockies Ticket Information
While it’s no secret that the altitude can be a nuisance for pitchers, fans would be hard-pressed to find a more exciting venue than Coors Field, home to Colorado Rockies baseball. With its picturesque setting in the Rocky Mountains, this popular destination for MLB faithful is an essential place to take in a game, so be sure to start the season with Rockies Opening Day tickets. You also can check out the squad as early as March with Rockies spring training tickets for preseason contests in Arizona.
Don’t miss out on any of the other matchups this season either, as a full spectrum of rivals will making way to the Mile High City in the months to come, including the San Francisco Giants, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, Tampa Bay Rays, and Texas Rangers.

About Us
More than tickets, Vivid Seats…




















Vivid Seats was created out of a genuine love for attending live events…
We all feel the anticipation right after the lights go down. We remember the sounds of the orchestra pit tuning their instruments to deliver enchanting musical scores and standing ovations. We remember the blazing guitar solos, the last second scores, the come-from-behind wins, and the cheers of the fans. It's no accident we're named Vivid Seats…"vivid" comes from the Latin word "vivere" which means "to live"…and going to live events gives you the chance to live the music, live the culture, and live the glory that all generate the vivid memories and unique stories that will last a lifetime! 
Our Purpose
We know that the live event experience starts long before you step into the venue. From the moment you learn about the event, you start figuring out if you can go, who you want to go with, and where you want to sit. Those decisions are all part of what can make the experience great… or, on the other hand, a frustrating hassle. With this in mind, we created Vivid Seats to reinvent the ticket purchasing experience. We have the best tools in the industry for you to learn, shop, share, plan, and organize your live event experience. We continually invest in our site's functionality and information so that you can go from start-to-finish faster and easier than on any other ticket website. And we've worked hard to be the leader in providing value, uniquely combining discount prices with premium service. Simply put, we want you to be able to go to as many live events as possible, and we want to provide the best experience in the industry!
Our Guarantee
We also know that buying tickets requires trust—nobody wants to get ripped off and no one wants to worry about their tickets. That's why we designed our site to be the safest, most secure way to buy tickets online. We never pass along your personal information to the seller, and we back all orders with our 100% Buyer Guarantee. While many of our competitors let just about anyone sell a ticket without sticking around to help, our service covers the rigorous screening process we apply to all the sellers on our website and supports our dedicated, in-house customer service team. We are there to protect and help you all along the way. We invest in the process and infrastructure so that you can purchase tickets worry-free. 
 Our Commitment
We are committed to earning your satisfaction with every order. We have the most responsive customer service team in the industry with decades of professional experience satisfying our thousands of loyal customers and corporate clients. We are here to help you from start to finish…any time…all the time. Getting the right seats at the right price in a fast-moving market requires skilled, efficient, professional coordination. Our full service staff is there to do just that—fully dedicated to giving you the best ticket buying experience in the industry!
As the gateway to your spectacular and memorable live event experiences, we want you to look forward to your upcoming concert, show, or game with confidence, peace of mind, and genuine happiness and excitement, every step of the way. Vivid Seats is your ticket to live events!
Jerry and Eric, Founders
