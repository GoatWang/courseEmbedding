KenetMD products are now available for sale online! - Travel Codex                Travel CodexYour Resource for Better Travel  KenetMD products are now available for sale online! by Brad | August 17, 2013KenetMD products for sale: Click Here to buyUpdate:  it appears the Hyatt is no longer selling  KenetMD (or any other) retail products No more hoarding hotel shampoo when at Hyatt properties!  (Well, feel free if you like.)   The good news is that Hyatt has finally begun to sell their popular KenetMD bath products online. Previously, I’ve written about Hyatt’s old (stinky!) Portico White Ginger products, as well as the new bath products from KenetMD.  Based on the feedback I’ve received, many people are interested in buying these products for their own use.  This has been promised to be available in “Summer 2013”, and now these are available for sale on Hyatt’s retail site.No, I do not receive a commission for these products, I just wanted to share the information, since there have been so many requests.Enjoy! Update:Currently, KenetMD products are no longer available for sale. Hyatt has exclusive access to the products offered in hotels, and have stopped retail sales. Follow me on Twitter Google+ and Instagram  6SHARESShareTweetSubscribe ScottyHey Brad,Thanks for the info on this.About six months ago I wrote Hyatt and asked them to send me samples of all their new products.  A couple weeks later I received this BEAUTIFUL zip bag that had everything in it including soaps, shampoo, conditioner, and everything else.  It was quite nice. jackie dupuisi recently stayed at the Hyatt hotel in Boston and was amazed after i used the shampoo and conditioner[KenetMD}                                                      My hair has never been so easy to manage  Thank you MY address in Canada is [redacted] SJ SpicherOne of the best shampoos and conditioners I ever used.

AndraI was very surprised to find these high quality haircare products provided by the Vancouver, BC Hyatt Regency. I’m in love with KenetMD shampoo and conditioner and just ordered a bottle of each! This product line is amazing…not greasy or heavy… just clean, shiny and bouncy…. a very important quality for a professional hair flipper like myself. http://www.hairflipps.blogspot.com Leslie HeilalaOn this page you show a round bar of soap, but when I go to click here to buy it is not shown.  Is there a way for me to purchase the cleanse well bar soap? Brad@Leslie, I suggest you contact KenetMD directly at http://www.kenetmd.com/ Deborah HI stayed at the Hyatt in Jacksonville Florida and was very pleased with the soap and lotion. They left my skin feeling very smooth and moisturized. Brenda TateI have itchy dry allergy skin.  It peels like snake skin. My face has fine dry patchy bumps.

Fiesta it come in bigger tubes?Thanks Brenda Dianna CTo whom It May Concern: I’m writing to inform you that the Kenetmd body lotion is the best lotion I’ve ever used in my entire life, after using this product on my fore arms for a few days I found my skin to be wonderfully soft and smooth, I might also add that my arms were in not so good condition due to driving and the sun hitting my arms directly but after using the body lotion my skin is now soft, I plan on ordering more items from the website. Thank you, Dianna C Bonnie DalenI am interested in trying your products. I have been reading your reviews and have heard, by a friend, that your shampoo and conditioner is wonderful. The only question I have is, is your shampoo and conditioner for “Color Treated” hair? If so, could you send me some samples? YogesI want to purchase the shampoo please. Dominic CammaranoI tried to purchase the KenetMD shampoo and the website says temporarily unavailable.Do you know when it will be available? BradThanks to everyone for reading.Based on some of the comments here, I should clarify that I do not work for, nor do I have any connection to KenetMD.  I have spoken to people there, and I will try to reach out and find out about availability of their products online.  @Dominic, I’ll let you know if I can find more information about this.Updated: My contact has informed me that the KenetMD products have been shipped from the manufacturer and should be back in stock on the Hyatt website soon.
