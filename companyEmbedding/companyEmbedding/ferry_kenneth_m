KenetMD products are now available for sale online! - Travel Codex                Travel CodexYour Resource for Better Travel  KenetMD products are now available for sale online! by Brad | August 17, 2013KenetMD productsÂ for sale:Â Click Here to buyUpdate: Â it appears the Hyatt is no longer selling Â KenetMD (or any other) retail productsÂ No more hoarding hotel shampoo when at Hyatt properties! Â (Well, feel free if you like.) Â  The good news is that Hyatt has finally begun to sell their popular KenetMD bath products online.Â Previously, Iâve written about Hyattâs old (stinky!) Portico White Ginger products, as well as the new bath products from KenetMD. Â Based on the feedback Iâve received, many people are interested in buying these products for their own use. Â This has been promised to be available in âSummer 2013â, and now these are available for sale on Hyattâs retail site.No, I do not receive a commission for these products, I just wanted to share the information, since there have been so many requests.Enjoy!Â Update:Currently, KenetMD products are no longer available for sale. Hyatt has exclusive access to the products offered in hotels, and have stopped retail sales.Â FollowÂ meÂ onÂ TwitterÂ Google+Â andÂ InstagramÂ Â 6SHARESShareTweetSubscribe ScottyHey Brad,Thanks for the info on this.About six months ago I wrote Hyatt and asked them to send me samples of all their new products.

Thank you, Dianna C Bonnie DalenI am interested in trying your products. I have been reading your reviews and have heard, by a friend, that your shampoo and conditioner is wonderful.
