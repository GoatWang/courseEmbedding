Orange lettering on front cover, with brown and black illustration of dog. Title page not dated. Copyright page dated 1909. Unpaginated. In good condition. Covers appear rubbed and slightly faded. Paper at corners a bit worn, partially revealing boards beneath. Gentle bumping at head and foot of spine. Front gutter is cracked, but binding remains secure. No loose pages. Color illustrations throughout by Katharine Maynadier Browne. There are some crayon markings on a number of pages -- nothing too intrusive though. A number of pages have a bit of creasing, and one page has a small tear, about one inch long. Otherwise book is quite clean and in good condition -- a good reading copy.
