	Bed and breakfast accommodation in Cambridge University colleges


Not just for students - anyone can book!


		A unique backstage pass providing the opportunity to stay in a historic Cambridge college during your visit to this heritage-rich city, whilst helping to generate revenue contributing to the upkeep of these iconic buildings.

		These bed and breakfast or self catering rooms are mostly located in central Cambridge

		Re-trace the footsteps of graduates such as Newton, Darwin, Wordsworth, John Cleese, and Prince Charles; eat in the college hall, wander through the college's gardens or take a punt along the river followed by a drink in the college bar.

		A great alternative to staying in a cheap Cambridge hotel, hostel or B&B.




	Bed and breakfast accommodation in Cambridge University colleges



Customer feedback
"I started out looking for UK campus boarding experience and had my expectation fulfilled with one full of history and tradition.  The accommodation whether for tourists (who know what they asking for) or students is beyond value for money. Location excellently close to everything and yet the college is well sound-proved from the busy streets." cheung a "The room/en-suite were extremely clean with a comfortable bed, good quality linen and nice additional touches such as the nice toiletries and dressing gown/slippers etc.  The college is very central and it was a bonus to be able to leave our car free of additional cost within the grounds and walk around the city centre.  The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice.  We didn't use it, but we also had the use of a kitchen had we wanted it. " Mrs clare m "I love big spaces, big windows, high ceiling of Churchill College, Cambridge building which was designed to well harmonize with nature, sunlight, flowers, etc...Room size is big with big windows. This college serves the guests amazing breakfast for us in the special designed big dinning room. All staffs in this college are friendly, kind and helpful for us. There are many beautiful natural places to enjoy taking a walk, less than 15 minutes walk to town centre. Highly recommendation. Thank you very much. " Mrs Atsuko H

	Bed and breakfast accommodation in Cambridge University colleges


Not just for students - anyone can book!


		A unique backstage pass providing the opportunity to stay in a historic Cambridge college during your visit to this heritage-rich city, whilst helping to generate revenue contributing to the upkeep of these iconic buildings.

		These bed and breakfast or self catering rooms are mostly located in central Cambridge

		Re-trace the footsteps of graduates such as Newton, Darwin, Wordsworth, John Cleese, and Prince Charles; eat in the college hall, wander through the college's gardens or take a punt along the river followed by a drink in the college bar.

		A great alternative to staying in a cheap Cambridge hotel, hostel or B&B.




	Bed and breakfast accommodation in Cambridge University colleges



Customer feedback
"I started out looking for UK campus boarding experience and had my expectation fulfilled with one full of history and tradition.  The accommodation whether for tourists (who know what they asking for) or students is beyond value for money. Location excellently close to everything and yet the college is well sound-proved from the busy streets." cheung a "The room/en-suite were extremely clean with a comfortable bed, good quality linen and nice additional touches such as the nice toiletries and dressing gown/slippers etc.  The college is very central and it was a bonus to be able to leave our car free of additional cost within the grounds and walk around the city centre.  The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice.  We didn't use it, but we also had the use of a kitchen had we wanted it. " Mrs clare m "I love big spaces, big windows, high ceiling of Churchill College, Cambridge building which was designed to well harmonize with nature, sunlight, flowers, etc...Room size is big with big windows. This college serves the guests amazing breakfast for us in the special designed big dinning room. All staffs in this college are friendly, kind and helpful for us. There are many beautiful natural places to enjoy taking a walk, less than 15 minutes walk to town centre. Highly recommendation. Thank you very much. " Mrs Atsuko H

Cambridge Visitor information


	An introduction to Cambridge

	With Cambridge, the word unique takes on a new meaning. Founded as a University in 1209, the city today has preserved much of its outstanding beauty and original character as a quiet place of thought.

	Visit Cambridge to wander among its narrow medieval streets or “The Backs”, the outstanding series of college gardens and grounds that lead down to the river. Study architecture of every period and of almost every century, and inspect the University’s many important literary, artistic, and scientific treasures. Some ideas include ghost walks, MP3 guided walks, visiting the Fitzwilliam Museum and of course, no visit to Cambridge is complete without punting down the River Cam!

“Such a balance of garden and building, of shape and form, of peace, quiet and constantly changing scene is only achieved once in the world” (R Tibbs, 1972).

	It should be understood that colleges are designed primarily for students: not for children or adults expecting a high level of luxury. However, with this in mind, the colleges do meet level of comfort that we expect most visitors to be happy with, and we will welcome any feedback where this is not the case.

	Dates of Cambridge's academic vacations

	Rooms are mainly available during the academic vacations.

	Easter: mid-March to mid-April
	Summer: mid-June to mid-October
	Christmas: beginning of December to mid-January

	Getting to Cambridge

	From London: the best options include train or bus. Trains leave every half an hour from London Kings Cross or London Liverpool St (enquiries: 08457 48 49 50; www.nationalrail.co.uk). The approximate journey time is one hour and the return fare is £15.00 to £17.70 depending on time of travel.  The walk from the station to the centre of Cambridge takes about 20 minutes, or you can take a taxi from the rank at the front of the train station, the approximate cost of which is £5-£6.

	Parking: Cambridge is generally not very car friendly, with pedestrianised zones and one-way systems. Some colleges (including Churchill, Downing, Fitzwilliam, Jesus, Lucy Cavendish, Murray Edwards) offer on-site parking facilities, or alternatively there are large car parks in the city, with more information here  We would advise against using the Park and Ride services as they don't allow overnight parking.

	If travelling from an airport to Cambridge, the best options are either hiring a car or taking a coach: www.gobycoach.com.

Customer feedback
We guarantee that all our feedback is genuine and can only be submitted by people who have booked through our websites.
Mr Phillip L (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): The lady at the front desk was superb 
Prof Frederica T (West Court (Jesus College) Cambridge, June 2017): Beautiful accommodation and fantastic value for money
Dr wayne L (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): Excellent stay, staff at college extremely helpful. 
Ms Mavis P (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): The whole experience was a wonderful surprise. I didn't know anything about the Westminster College, so, besides appreciating the service etc, I was very interested to read the posters in the corridor describing the life of Luther, most of the detail quite unknown to me, and the Great Hall where we had breakfast was so beautiful with its carved fireplace, unusual light-fittings, even the lovely chairs, and the lantern with the Dove of Peace. I could hardly tear myself away. I would like to come back for a few days soon please!
Ms Suzette H (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): Quiet and civilized. All staff extremely pleasant and helpful.
Dr Peter H (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): The best value for money en suite B&B in central Cambridge.
Ms Pamela S (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): Excellent place to stay. Comfortable room, helpful staff, good location. 
Mr Arnold C (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): Very pleasant stay.  Appreciated the friendly services.
Mrs Bernice P (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): My experience at Westminster College was a most pleasant one. 
 The room was clean, comfortable and near the centre of town, without it being noisy.  The staff on reception were most helpful and welcoming.  My only regret is that I only booked for one night!
Mr Carl W (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): Great place to stay with reasonable prices compared to hotels in the Cambridge area.
Mr Adrian G (West Court (Jesus College) Cambridge, June 2017): It was a delightful stay. Room was perfect and breakfast was first class. Amazing value for money - thank you!
Mrs Sonia W (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): My friend and I were both very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the room and interaction with the staff.  The room was very clean with all essentials catered for.  The staff were friendly.  I would book again over any hotel!  
Mrs Silke O (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): A centrally located accomodation with a special atmosphere,  very clean rooms, well refurbished, a good breakfast, a nice welcome.
Ms jane R (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): We felt very well cared for. Very thoughtful touches. No hesitation recommending the accommodation at this college 
Ms Zara M (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): Exceeded expectations - lovely room well equipped, great breakfast and excellent service plus in a beautiful building and amazing location, would love to come again! 
Miss Dai Ming L (West Court (Jesus College) Cambridge, June 2017): Everything is awesome. I didn't expect that much to stay in a college resident, but it is really excellent. The people were really kind and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay there!
Mrs Teresa M (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): Westminster College is a lovely quiet place to stay in Cambridge and is close to the city centre. It is very comfortable and clean and the staff are very helpful. I have stayed here a few times and it is very good value for money considering it's central location.
Mr Eric Y (Westminster College, Cambridge, June 2017): Wonderful stay nice and close to a beautiful city!
Ms Jane W (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Lovely place to stay, nice and central can walk or get taxis. Lovely weather - which helped. Very helpful reception. 

Thank you for a lovely stay, will be back.
Ms Laura M (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Lovely stay. Staff very helpful and pleasant, room had everything we needed (even a small kitchen!) and very clean and quiet. Same price as a cheap hotel, Premier Inn etc, but so much nicer.
Mr CHRISTOPHER D (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): As I was attending events at Kings College Chapel, this was a very convenient, and as it turned out, very pleasant place of accommodation. I hope to visit again.
Mrs Brenda Z (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Comfy and roomy accommodation 
Delicious breakfast 
Close to everything 
Mr Robert H (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): The staff were extremely helpful, the food was quite good, and the room was neat & had new fixtures. I would happily stay here again.
Miss Agusta K (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Westminster College offers high-quality accommodation in a friendly yet professional environment. I loved the atmosphere and particularly appreciated the chapel, which had open access for most of my stay. My room was well-equipped and clean, with a comfortable bed and a very useful kitchenette. I will return here on my next visit to Cambridge!
Mr David S (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Excellent location, comfortable and quiet room, car parking and lovely people and building
Mr Kim S (West Court (Jesus College) Cambridge, May 2017): Lovely venue, relaxed, delicious breakfast. Room atmospheric with great view of court at this wonderful University.
Dr Andrew J (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Would stay again, really impressed for the price. Thank you
Mrs Amanda H (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): We were impressed with the facilities and the warmth and helpfulness of the reception staff.  Only a one night stay, but I am sure we will return.  Westminster College is extremely central and offers excellent value for money.
Mrs Delyth C (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): I am really glad that I came here. It  is a lovely place and I was made very welcome. The room was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Perfect location, near the 'backs'. Excellent value.
Miss Ali J (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Really well-located, quiet and clean place to stay, when I am working in Cambridge, with modern, yet basic rooms. The Arts & Crafts architecture, esp, some of the interior is quite beautiful + the parking onsite is also super handy.
Mr christopher G (Westminster College Cottages, Cambridge, May 2017): What a fabulous place! The young lady who checked us in on reception went over and above to offer tips and advice for our stay, marking places on the map and generally being super helpful. The cottage is delightful, a haven of peace but yet a stone's throw from the city centre - perfect!
Mr leonard B (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): excellent in every respect
Mrs Sharon C (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): We loved every minute of our stay and will be back. Thank you. 
Mrs Susan  G (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Fab place in a fab setting, will definitely go again 
Dr Katja B (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): quiet, large room, centrally located, town center in walking distance, friendly staff (no TV though - but not missed).
Memories came back to my summer school experiences in the UK.
Ms Mary S (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Excellent - lovely room and very good value for money. 
Dr Dilyara S (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): 
 Very clean room, good location! 
Mr George P (Westminster College, Cambridge, May 2017): Excellent place to stay while in Cambridge. Really clean and tidy rooms and staff were all fantastic. Could not want for a better breakfast. Will definitely be returning
Mrs Caroline B (Jesus College, Cambridge, May 2017): Fabulous rooms in central Cambridge, Clean, Quiet and well set out. Great Value for money.
Mr Gerald  B (Westminster College, Cambridge, April 2017): That accommodation surpassed our expectations. The room was extremely clean, simply furnished with quality units/fittings and a comfortable bed, the bathroom was extremely clean and had an excellent shower. The kitchenette had ample cupboards, a microwave, a grill and a table and chairs. Everything had been very well thought out. The breakfast was superb and everyone in reception was extremely helpful. We wished we could have stayed for more than one night. Very good value and only 10 minutes walk from the town centre. We will stay there again when we next go to Cambridge.
