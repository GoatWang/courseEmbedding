BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the asset management business of 
      State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) today announced two new

      decades ago, and launched numerous ‘world firsts’ since,” said Rory 
      Tobin, co-head of the global SPDR business. “As our business has 
      expanded and matured, so too have the responsibilities of our product 
      and marketing teams. Both Noel and Seth have strong track records of 
      developing ETF products consistent with client and regulatory 
      requirements. We are delighted to welcome them both to the team, and we 
      look forward to their leadership as we evolve and grow our Global SPDR 
      ETF business.”
    

      In this newly created role, Archard will be responsible for product 
      strategy, innovation, range and lifecycle management for the global SPDR 
      ETF business. He will report in to Cyrus Taraporevala, head of the 
      global institutional group, and Tobin. Archard brings a wealth of 
      knowledge with more than 20 years’ experience in the global asset 
      management industry. Most recently, he was country head of BlackRock in 
      Canada tasked with growing the company across all business lines within 
      this market. Prior to this, Archard held positions at Blackrock and 
      Vanguard, helping to build and establish their ETF programs. He is a 
      graduate of Northwestern University and a CFA Charterholder.
    

      Also in a newly created role, Morrison will be responsible for all 
      marketing activities across the SPDR business in North America, EMEA and 
      APAC. He will report in to Nick Good, co-head of the global SPDR 
      business, and Stephen Tisdalle, chief marketing officer of SSGA. “Both 
      of these new roles demonstrate our commitment to expanding the reach and 
      relevancy of SPDR value-added services and our broad range of ETF 
      investment capabilities to institutional and intermediary clients,” said 
      Good. Additionally Tisdalle commented, “Our ETF business is embracing 
      innovative marketing programs that communicate our perspectives and 
      insights to help investors make informed decisions about their 
      portfolios.”
    

      Morrison joins SSGA from Vanguard where he served as head of Flagship 
      Business Development Group, the high net-worth sales group for their US 
      Retail business. Prior to this, Seth was head of Vanguard’s 
      International Marketing team. Previously, Seth spent more than 10 years

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Important Risk Information
Equity securities may fluctuate in value in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.
Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets.
Low volatility funds can exhibit relative low volatility and excess returns compared to the Index over the long term; both portfolio investments and returns may differ from those of the Index. The fund may not experience lower volatility or provide returns in excess of the Index and may provide lower returns in periods of a rapidly rising market. Active stock selection may lead to added risk in exchange for the potential outperformance relative to the Index.
Quantitative investing assumes that future performance of a security relative to other securities may be predicted based on historical economic and financial factors, however, any errors in a model used might not be detected until the fund has sustained a loss or reduced performance related to such errors.
