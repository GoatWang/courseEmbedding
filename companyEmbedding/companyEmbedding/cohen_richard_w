        New York,        10601      













Richard Cohen represents health insurers in complex litigation. Mr. Cohen argued and won landmark decisions, for Humana establishing Medicare Advantage Organizations’ reimbursement recovery rights under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act, In re Avandia Marketing Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, 685 F.3d 353 (3d Cir. 2012), cert. denied, sub nom. GlaxoSmithKline v. Humana Med. Plans, Inc., 81 U.S.L.W. 3579 (Apr. 15, 2013), and for Louisiana Blue Cross establishing the direct (non-subrogation) rights of commercial health insurers to recover overcharges from drug companies for drugs prescribed to their insureds, Desiano v. Warner-Lambert, 326 F.3d 339 (2d Cir. 2003). Mr. Cohen also prosecuted Aetna’s successful appeal in In re Neurontin Mktg. & Sales Practices Litigation, 712 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2013), holding drug manufacturers accountable to health insurers for damages attributable to marketing fraud.
Mr. Cohen was class counsel, and argued successful appeals, for health insurers in In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 332 F.3d 896 (6th Cir. 2003) (settlement of $80 million), and In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litigation, 391 F.3d 516 (3d Cir. 2004) (settlement of $44.5 million). In In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litigation, Mr. Cohen argued successfully for certification of a litigation class, 282 F.R.D. 126 (E.D. Pa. 2011), and for the right to prosecute antitrust claims under New York law as class claims, the first decision to so hold, 756 F. Supp. 2d 670 (E.D. Pa. 2010). Mr. Cohen negotiated settlement allocations for health insurers of $110 million and $288 million, respectively, in 2005 from the manufacturers of the prescription drug Lupron and in 2009 from McKesson Corporation. Mr. Cohen represented 35 health insurers in actions relating to the prescription drug Vioxx, resulting in settlements exceeding $80 million in 2009 and 2010.
Mr. Cohen defended and won dismissals for health insurers of the following class actions: Meek-Horton v. Trover Solutions, 910 F. Supp. 2d 690 (S.D.N.Y. 2013); Potts v. Rawlings Co., LLC, 897 F. Supp. 2d 185, 2012 (S.D.N.Y. 2012); Kesselman v. The Rawlings Company, LLC, 668 F. Supp. 2d 604 (S.D.N.Y. 2009); Elliot Plaza Pharmacy v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, 2009 WL 702837 (N.D. Okla. March 16, 2009); Main Drug, Inc. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, 475 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir. 2007) (dismissing appeals from Main Drug, Inc. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, 455 F. Supp. 2d 1323 (M.D. Ala. 2006) and 455 F. Supp. 2d 1317 (M.D. Ala. 2005); and Medfusion Rx, LLC v. Humana Health Plan, Inc., Case No. CV-08-PWG-0451-S (N.D. Ala.). Mr. Cohen is currently defending the class action Roche, et al. v. Aetna, Inc., et al., Civ. 13-1377 (JHR) (D.N.J.).
Mr. Cohen represented America Health Insurance Plans, a national association representing the health insurance industry, as amicus curiae in FTC v. Actavis, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2223 (2013) concerning how “pay-for-delay” agreements between brand name drug companies and generic companies should be evaluated under federal antitrust law. Mr. Cohen represented the National Coalition of Pharmaceutical Distributors as amicus curiae in a successful appeal enjoining the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from implementing prescription drug “pedigree” rules that discriminate against secondary wholesalers. Dept. of Health and Human Services, U.S. FDA v. RxUSA Wholesale, Inc., 285 Fed. App’x. 809 (2d. Cir. 2008).
Mr. Cohen has represented institutional investors in numerous stockholder voting rights and corporate governance cases, including Western Investment Total Return Fund Ltd. v. Bremer (Nuveen), 762 F. Supp. 2d 339 (D. Mass. 2011); Gabelli Global Multimedia v. Western Investment LLC, 700 F. Supp. 2d 748 (D. Md. 2010); Delcath Systems, Inc. v. Ladd, 466 F.3d 257 (2d. Cir. 2006); Salomon Brothers Mun. Partners Fund, Inc. v. Thornton, 410 F. Supp. 2d 330 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); meVC Draper Fisher Jurvetson Fund I, Inc. v. Millennium Partners, 260 F. Supp. 2d 616 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); and Millenco L.P. v. meVC Draper Fisher Jurvetson Fund I, Inc., 824 A.2d 11 (Del. Ch. 2002). In 2009, Mr. Cohen tried, won, and collected for hedge fund investors, a multi-million dollar arbitration award in Pierot v. Colonial Investment Management, AAA No. 13 148 Y 02207 08.  Mr. Cohen has advised boards of directors of public companies for approximately 30 years and has served as a director of one public company and as a corporate secretary for another.
Mr. Cohen has often been a speaker at legal education conferences, including Northwestern University School of Law’s “Sixth Annual Antitrust Conference” (2000); The American Bar Association’s Section of Litigation’s “Current Issues in Pharmaceutical Litigation Policy” (2008); Blue Cross Blue Shield Association’s Annual Lawyers’ Conference (2010); The American Conference Institute’s “Advanced Forum on Managed Care Disputes and Litigation” (2011, 2012, 2013); and Dealflow Media’s “Activist Investor Conference” (2013).  Mr. Cohen was a contributor to the American Bar Association’s “State Antitrust Enforcement Handbook.”
Mr. Cohen is rated “AV Preeminent” by Martindale-Hubbell, the highest rating a lawyer can obtain, as established by confidential opinions from members of the bench and bar and reflecting maintenance of an “AV” rating for more than 20 consecutive years.  Mr. Cohen is also recognized as a “Super Lawyer” in the New York Metro region by ALM Publications.
Mr. Cohen graduated from Georgetown University (A.B. 1977) and the New York University School of Law (J.D. 1980).  Mr. Cohen is admitted to practice in New York and Pennsylvania, and is a member of the bars of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th and 11th Circuits; and the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the Eastern District of Michigan and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

But it's his daughter's agent (I guess she's a professional tennis player or something, whoopee) and he ends up talking for 5 minutes on and on about some BS. Finally, I throw my hands up and say, "Excuse me!" and he tells the guy on the phone, "I'm sorry I have to go I have a patient"--and of course he goes on talking for another couple of minutes. Seriously, dude, are you out of your mind. I should have walked out, but it was my first time with a psychiatrist and I wanted to give it a shot. So we talk for about 3 minutes, he doesn't listen to a thing I say and then sends me out the door with two different prescriptions for some heavy meds--and I've never taken any type of Rx before.Seriously this guy is a major P.O.S. Like the folks below said, he books everyone on top of each other and sees each patient for about 10-15 mins after you wait for 45 mins to an hour.

She's always professional and really takes time with her patients which is much appreciated.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
