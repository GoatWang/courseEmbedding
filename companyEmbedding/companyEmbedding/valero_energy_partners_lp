History[edit]
Valero was created on January 1, 1980,[4] as a spinoff of Coastal States Gas Corporation. At the time, it was the largest corporate spinoff in U.S. history. Valero took over the natural gas operations of the LoVaca Gathering Company, a defunct subsidiary of Coastal States Gas. The name Valero comes from Misión San Antonio de Valero. Valero acquired a small oil refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1981, and began refining operations in 1984.
In 1997, Valero spun off its refinery and retail divisions into a separate company, which kept the Valero name. At the same time, the remaining divisions, which consisted primarily of natural gas operations, were acquired by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Later that year, the firm acquired Basis Petroleum, which left it with four refineries in Texas and Louisiana. In 1998, it then acquired a Paulsboro, New Jersey, refinery, the company's first outside of the Gulf Coast area.
In 2000, Valero purchased ExxonMobil's Benicia, California, refinery and interest in 350 Exxon-branded service stations in California, mainly in the San Francisco Bay Area. The company also began retailing gasoline under the Valero brand. In June 2001, Valero acquired the Huntway Refining Company, along with two asphalt plants on the West Coast.




Shamrock gas station, a division of Valero EC


On December 31, 2001, Valero completed its acquisition of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock. The merger left Valero with over 4,700 Ultramar, Diamond Shamrock, and Beacon retail sites in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. With this acquisition, Valero also received ownership of Shamrock Logistics L.P., which was renamed Valero L.P. In 2006, the division was spun off as NuStar Energy. Starting in 2002, Valero has expanded its marketing to the East Coast, specifically the Northeast and Florida, using the Valero brand. The acquisition also includes all past Diamond Shamrock assets, including the former Sigmor Petroleum assets founded by Thomas E. Turner, founder of TETCO Inc. (the Sigmor brand name was the initials of Sigfried Moore, Turner's former employer) which merged with Shamrock Oil and Gas in 1960 forming Sigmor Shamrock - which was merged into Diamond Shamrock in 1982. Turner later repurchased Mission Petroleum Carriers when it was acquired by Diamond Shamrock which was the foundation of TETCO,[5] and the business portfolio of the former National Convenience Stores, which was acquired by Diamond Shamrock in November 1995.[6]
On April 25, 2005, Valero agreed to buy Premcor, Inc., for $8 billion in cash and stock to become the largest U.S. refinery, as record prices for gasoline and other fuel boosted profits. On June 30, 2005, Valero announced that it was beginning a two-year process of converting Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand. In the next year, on May 5, 2008, Valero agreed to buy 72 Albertsons gas stations.
Valero laid off 500 employees at its refinery in Delaware City, Delaware on November 20, 2009, due to profitability concerns. It was reported the refinery had lost $1 million per day since the beginning of the year.[citation needed]
On March 11, 2011, Valero announced that it had agreed to a major European purchase from Chevron Corp. for $730 million in cash, not including working capital that will be determined at closing. Estimates on the value of the working capital would place the total price at $1.73 billion. The acquisition includes Chevron's Pembroke Refinery in Wales — one of Europe's largest and most complex — together with marketing and logistical assets throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, which include 4 pipelines, 11 terminals, an aviation fuel business, about 1,000 retail outlets, inventory and other items. [7] [8] [9]
In 2013, Valero spun off its retail operations into a new publicly traded company, CST Brands.[10] Under long-term supply agreements, Valero continues to supply fuel to over 7,400 retail locations, many of which use brand names formerly owned by Valero.[11]
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Valero 28th among corporations that emit airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on both the quantity (3.4 million pounds in 2005) and the toxicity of the emissions.[12]
Valero was the biggest[13] financial backer of the failed 2010 California Proposition 23 and contributed more than $4 million by August 2010.[14] Had it passed, Proposition 23 would have delayed action on greenhouse-gas emissions in the state of California by delaying current implementation of the California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 until the state attained an unemployment rate of 5.5% or less for one full year.[15][16] Critics argued that because that had happened only three times over the last 40 years, the proposition would have had the practical effect of repealing the law.[17][18]
Valero owns two oil refineries in California. The Benicia Refinery is located on the Carquinez Strait, a tributary of the San Francisco Bay.[19] The Wilmington Refinery[20] is located 23 miles (37 km) south from downtown Los Angeles.[21]
Valero's Wilmington (CA), Benicia (CA), and Port Arthur (TX) refineries are known to carry and process crude oil from the Amazon region of South America, a large concern for environmentalists trying to protect the Amazon rainforest. In 2015, Wilmington and Benicia processed about 13,000 barrels of Amazonian crude oil per day, combined.[22]
Defense contracts[edit]
According to Robert Bryce,[23] author and managing editor of Energy Tribune, Valero Energy Corp. has been awarded multiple multimillion-dollar contracts by the U.S. Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) in order to provide fuel to Israel.
Divestitures[edit]
Valero Energy reached an agreement to sell the assets of its terminal operation and discontinue operations in Delaware City to the wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy – Delaware City Refining and Delaware Pipeline – for approximately $220 million in 2010.[24]
Shortly after the divestiture of Delaware City, the company sold its refinery at the Port of Paulsboro to PBF Energy, as well. The sale concluded Valero's refinery ownership on the East Coast.[24]
Acquisitions[edit]
On August 1, 2011, Valero acquired the Pembroke Refinery from Chevron, as well as the marketing and logistics assets, for $730 million, excluding working capital, which was valued at approximately $1 billion. The Pembroke plant is one of the largest and most complex refineries in Western Europe with a total throughput capacity of 270,000 barrels (43,000 m3) per day and a Nelson complexity index rating of 11.8. This puts Valero at a total of 15 refineries and 2.9 million barrels (460,000 m3) per day of throughput capacity overall, solidifying the company’s standing as the world’s largest independent refinery.
Valero also purchased ownership interest in four major pipelines and eleven fuel terminals, a 14,000-barrel (2,200 m3)-per-day aviation fuel business, and a network of more than 1,000 Texaco-branded wholesale sites, which is the largest branded dealer network in the United Kingdom and the second-largest in Ireland. Valero has continued with the Texaco brand in these markets.
Retail[edit]




A typical Valero gas station in Mountain View, California






A Valero Gas Station in Haltom City, Texas on Western Center Blvd that opened in 1986 as Diamond Shamrock, fully converted to Valero in 2005.


Valero retails gasoline branded as Valero, Shamrock, Diamond Shamrock,[25] Ultramar, Beacon, and Total, the last under license from Total S.A.. While this arm of the company was the most visible to the public, it was, according to CEO William R. Klesse, "a very small part of [Valero's] operations".[26]
Valero attempted to shift its focus from being a discount gasoline brand to becoming a premium brand. As part of the shift, Valero began to rebrand its Ultramar, Beacon, Total, and Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand. The Beacon and Shamrock brands are used by retailers as a low-cost alternative to the premium Valero brand. The Shamrock brand is based on the former Shamrock Oil and Gas Company, which merged with Diamond Alkali in 1967 to form Diamond Shamrock, thus declaring the trademark from official abandonment. The name Ultramar, while being eliminated in the United States, continued as Valero's brand name in Canada. Valero introduced its updated "Corner Store" retail concept on December 28, 2007, opening the company's first 5,500-square-foot (510 m2) prototype in western San Antonio. The Corner Store retail division, originally part of Diamond Shamrock, was absorbed into Valero's business portfolio in 2001. Not all Valero gas stations included a Corner Store - one Valero gas station in Euless, Texas east of Fort Worth is co-branded with a 7-Eleven convenience store.
Creation of CST Brands[edit]
On July 31, 2012, during the 2nd Quarter Earnings Conference Call, Valero announced intentions to separate the retail business from the remainder of the company. CFO Mike Ciskowski stated "We believe the separation of our retail business by way of a tax-efficient distribution to our shareholders will create operational flexibility within the business and unlock value for our shareholders." [27] In 2013, Valero completed the spinoff of the retail operations as CST Brands.[10] Valero no longer owns retail operations using the Valero, Diamond Shamrock, Shamrock, Beacon, Ultramar, or Texaco names, but Valero continues to supply fuel.[11]
Credit cards[edit]
Valero issues its own private label credit cards for its stations through its credit card-only subsidiary, DSRM National Bank. The initials stand for "Diamond Shamrock Refining & Marketing", the unit of Diamond Shamrock which created it before being purchased by Valero.[28]

Valero retails gasoline branded as Valero, Shamrock, Diamond Shamrock,[25] Ultramar, Beacon, and Total, the last under license from Total S.A.. While this arm of the company was the most visible to the public, it was, according to CEO William R. Klesse, "a very small part of [Valero's] operations".[26]
Valero attempted to shift its focus from being a discount gasoline brand to becoming a premium brand. As part of the shift, Valero began to rebrand its Ultramar, Beacon, Total, and Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand. The Beacon and Shamrock brands are used by retailers as a low-cost alternative to the premium Valero brand. The Shamrock brand is based on the former Shamrock Oil and Gas Company, which merged with Diamond Alkali in 1967 to form Diamond Shamrock, thus declaring the trademark from official abandonment. The name Ultramar, while being eliminated in the United States, continued as Valero's brand name in Canada. Valero introduced its updated "Corner Store" retail concept on December 28, 2007, opening the company's first 5,500-square-foot (510 m2) prototype in western San Antonio. The Corner Store retail division, originally part of Diamond Shamrock, was absorbed into Valero's business portfolio in 2001. Not all Valero gas stations included a Corner Store - one Valero gas station in Euless, Texas east of Fort Worth is co-branded with a 7-Eleven convenience store.
Creation of CST Brands[edit]
On July 31, 2012, during the 2nd Quarter Earnings Conference Call, Valero announced intentions to separate the retail business from the remainder of the company. CFO Mike Ciskowski stated "We believe the separation of our retail business by way of a tax-efficient distribution to our shareholders will create operational flexibility within the business and unlock value for our shareholders." [27] In 2013, Valero completed the spinoff of the retail operations as CST Brands.[10] Valero no longer owns retail operations using the Valero, Diamond Shamrock, Shamrock, Beacon, Ultramar, or Texaco names, but Valero continues to supply fuel.[11]
Credit cards[edit]
Valero issues its own private label credit cards for its stations through its credit card-only subsidiary, DSRM National Bank. The initials stand for "Diamond Shamrock Refining & Marketing", the unit of Diamond Shamrock which created it before being purchased by Valero.[28]

 (the "Partnership") today reported second quarter 2017 net income attributable to partners of $58 million, or $0.69 per common limited partner unit, and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") attributable to the Partnership of $80 million.  The Partnership reported net cash provided by operating activities of $66 million and distributable cash flow of $63 million.  The distribution coverage ratio for the second quarter was 1.5x.


                                        








"We operated safely and reliably during the quarter and generated strong earnings and distribution coverage," said Joe Gorder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VLP's general partner.  "We remain on pace to grow distributions at our target annual rate of 25 percent for 2017 and at least 20 percent for 2018."


                                        








On July 19, the board of directors of VLP's general partner declared a second quarter 2017 cash distribution of $0.455 per unit.  This distribution represents a 6.4 percent increase from the first quarter of 2017.


                                        








Financial Results 

                                        








Revenues were $110 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $87 million for the second quarter of 2016.  Operating expenses were $27 million, general and administrative expenses were $4 million, and depreciation expense was $12 million, all of which were in line with the second quarter of 2016.  Revenues were higher in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016 primarily due to contributions from the Meraux and Three Rivers terminals, which were acquired subsequent to the second quarter of last year, and the Red River pipeline segment, which was acquired in January 2017.


                                        








Liquidity and Financial Position        
As of June 30, 2017, the Partnership had $808 million of total liquidity consisting of $88 million in cash and cash equivalents and $720 million available on its revolving credit facility.  Capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership in the second quarter of 2017 were $6 million, including $5 million for expansion and $1 million for maintenance.


                                        








The Partnership continues to target $49 million of capital expenditures for 2017, which includes $35 million for expansion capital related to the distillate tank projects at the St. Charles and Port Arthur terminals and the new gasoline blending and segregation capability at the Corpus Christi terminal, all of which will improve Valero Energy Corporation's export capabilities. The remaining $14 million is for maintenance.

This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These statements discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking information. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "project," "could," "may," "should," "would," "will" or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the Partnership's control and are difficult to predict. These statements are often based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including examination of historical operating trends made by the management of the Partnership. Although the Partnership believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, the Partnership cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions.  When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in the Partnership's filings with the SEC, including the Partnership's annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available on the Partnership's website at         www.valeroenergypartners.com
. These risks could cause the Partnership's actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.


                                        








Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

                                        








This earnings release includes the terms "EBITDA," "distributable cash flow," and "coverage ratio."  These terms are supplemental financial measures that are not defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany this release.  In note (l) to the tables that accompany this release, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release provides useful information.

VALERO ENERGY PARTNERS LP        
NOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES

                                        








(a)  References to "Partnership," "we," "us," or "our" refer to Valero Energy Partners LP, one or more of its subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. For businesses that we acquired from Valero, those terms refer to Valero Energy Partners LP Predecessor, our Predecessor for accounting purposes for periods prior to their dates of acquisition. References in these notes to "Valero" may refer to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, other than Valero Energy Partners LP, any of its subsidiaries, or its general partner.


                                        








We acquired the following businesses from Valero in 2016:


                                        










On September 1, 2016, we acquired the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business for total consideration of $325.0 million.

                                    










On April 1, 2016, we acquired the McKee Terminal Services Business for total consideration of $240.0 million.

                                    










Each acquisition was accounted for as the transfer of a business between entities under the common control of Valero. Accordingly, the statement of income data, operating highlights, and capital expenditures data have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of operations of the acquired businesses for periods prior to their dates of acquisition.


                                        








(b)  The increase in operating revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to $14.0 million and $36.6 million, respectively, of incremental revenues generated by the acquired businesses described in Note (a) and $2.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of revenues generated by our Red River crude system. Prior to being acquired by us, the businesses described in Note (a) did not charge Valero for services provided and did not generate revenues. Effective with the date of each acquisition, we entered into additional schedules to our commercial agreements with Valero with respect to the services we provide to Valero using the assets of the acquired businesses. This resulted in new charges for terminaling services provided by these assets. In addition, effective January 18, 2017, we acquired a 40 percent undivided interest in (i) the newly constructed Hewitt segment of Plains All American L.P.'s Red River pipeline, (ii) two 150,000 shell barrel capacity tanks located at Hewitt Station, and (iii) a pipeline connection from Hewitt Station to Wasson Station (collectively, the Red River crude system).


                                        








(c)  The increase in operating expenses in the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to higher maintenance expense of $1.7 million at the Houston, St. Charles, Corpus Christi, and Three Rivers terminals, which was mainly related to inspection activity. In addition, we incurred total incremental expenses of $1.0 million related to our Red River crude system and the rail loading facility at our St. Charles terminal, which was placed in service in the second quarter of 2017.


                                        








The increase in operating expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to total incremental expenses of $1.5 million related to our Red River crude system and the rail loading facility at our St. Charles terminal.


                                        








(d)  The increase in general and administrative expenses in the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to higher public company costs of $156,000.


                                        








The decrease in general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to transaction costs of $387,000 in 2016 associated with the acquisition of businesses from Valero.


                                        








(e)  The increase in depreciation expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was attributed primarily to depreciation expense recognized on the assets that compose our Red River crude system, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2017.


                                        








(f)  The increase in "interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest" in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to the following:


                                        










Incremental borrowings in connection with the 2016 acquisitions. In connection with the acquisitions described in Note (a), we borrowed $139.0 million and $210.0 million under our revolving credit agreement. Interest expense on the incremental borrowings was approximately $1.3 million and $3.3 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.

                                    










Incremental interest expense incurred on the senior notes. In December 2016, we issued $500.0 million of 4.375% senior notes due December 2026. We used the proceeds of the senior notes to repay $494.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The interest rate on these senior notes is higher than our revolving credit facility, thereby increasing the effective interest rate in 2017. Incremental interest expense resulting from these senior notes was approximately $2.3 million and $4.9 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.

                                    










Higher interest rates in 2017. As a result of higher interest rates experienced in 2017, we incurred additional interest of $759,000 and $1.3 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, on borrowings under our subordinated loan agreements with Valero.

                                    










(g)  The requirements under our partnership agreement for the conversion of all of our outstanding subordinated units into common units were satisfied upon the payment of our quarterly cash distribution on August 9, 2016. Therefore, effective August 10, 2016, all of our subordinated units, which were owned by Valero, were converted on a one-for-one basis into common units. The conversion of the subordinated units does not impact the amount of cash distributions paid or the total number of outstanding units. The subordinated units were only allocated earnings generated by us through the conversion date.


                                        








(h)  Represents the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment divided by the number of days in the period. The increase in pipeline transportation throughput in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to volumes at our Red River crude system, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2017.


                                        








(i)  Management uses average revenue per barrel to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate average revenue per barrel; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate average revenue per barrel as revenue divided by throughput for the period. Throughput is derived by multiplying the throughput barrels per day (BPD) by the number of days in the period. Investors and analysts use this financial measure to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance.


                                        








(j)  Average pipeline transportation revenue per barrel was higher in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 due primarily to higher pipeline transportation revenue per barrel generated by our Red River crude system, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2017.


                                        








(k)  Storage and other revenues was higher in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 due primarily to revenues generated by the rail loading facility at our St. Charles terminal, which was placed in service in the second quarter of 2017.


                                        








(l)  Defined terms are as follows:


                                        










EBITDA is defined as net income less income tax expense, interest expense, and depreciation expense.

                                    










Distributable cash flow is defined as EBITDA less (i) EBITDA attributable to Predecessor and cash payments during the period for interest, income taxes, and maintenance capital expenditures; plus (ii) adjustments related to minimum throughput commitments, capital projects prefunded by Valero, and certain other items.

                                    










Distribution coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total distribution declared.

                                    










These terms are not defined under United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are considered non-GAAP measures. Management has defined these terms and believes that the presentation of the associated measures is useful to external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies, to:


                                        










describe our expectation of forecasted earnings;

                                    










assess our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded limited partnerships in the transportation and logistics industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of EBITDA, financing methods; 

                                    










assess the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders;

                                    










assess our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and

                                    










assess the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.

                                    










We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, because EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.


                                        








We use distributable cash flow to measure whether we have generated from our operations, or "earned," an amount of cash sufficient to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distributions. Our partnership agreement contains the concept of "operating surplus" to determine whether our operations are generating sufficient cash to support the distributions that we are paying, as opposed to returning capital to our partners. Because operating surplus is a cumulative concept (measured from our initial public offering (IPO) date and compared to cumulative distributions from the IPO date), we use distributable cash flow to approximate operating surplus on a quarterly or annual, rather than a cumulative, basis. As a result, distributable cash flow is not necessarily indicative of the actual cash we have on hand to distribute or that we are required to distribute.


                                        








We use the distribution coverage ratio to reflect the relationship between our distributable cash flow and the total distribution declared.

Valero Energy Corporation is a Fortune 500 international downstream manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels, other petrochemical products, and power. It is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, United States.[2] The company owns and operates 16 refineries throughout the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and the Caribbean with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3 million barrels (480,000 m3) per day, 11 ethanol plants with a combined production capacity of 1.2 billion US gallons (4,500,000 m3) per year, and a 50-megawatt wind farm. Before the 2013 spinoff of CST Brands, Valero was one of the United States' largest retail operators with approximately 6,800 retail and branded wholesale outlets in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and the Caribbean under the Valero, Diamond Shamrock, Shamrock, Ultramar, Beacon, and Texaco brands.[3]

History[edit]
Valero was created on January 1, 1980,[4] as a spinoff of Coastal States Gas Corporation. At the time, it was the largest corporate spinoff in U.S. history. Valero took over the natural gas operations of the LoVaca Gathering Company, a defunct subsidiary of Coastal States Gas. The name Valero comes from Misión San Antonio de Valero. Valero acquired a small oil refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1981, and began refining operations in 1984.
In 1997, Valero spun off its refinery and retail divisions into a separate company, which kept the Valero name. At the same time, the remaining divisions, which consisted primarily of natural gas operations, were acquired by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Later that year, the firm acquired Basis Petroleum, which left it with four refineries in Texas and Louisiana. In 1998, it then acquired a Paulsboro, New Jersey, refinery, the company's first outside of the Gulf Coast area.
In 2000, Valero purchased ExxonMobil's Benicia, California, refinery and interest in 350 Exxon-branded service stations in California, mainly in the San Francisco Bay Area. The company also began retailing gasoline under the Valero brand. In June 2001, Valero acquired the Huntway Refining Company, along with two asphalt plants on the West Coast.




Shamrock gas station, a division of Valero EC


On December 31, 2001, Valero completed its acquisition of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock. The merger left Valero with over 4,700 Ultramar, Diamond Shamrock, and Beacon retail sites in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. With this acquisition, Valero also received ownership of Shamrock Logistics L.P., which was renamed Valero L.P. In 2006, the division was spun off as NuStar Energy. Starting in 2002, Valero has expanded its marketing to the East Coast, specifically the Northeast and Florida, using the Valero brand. The acquisition also includes all past Diamond Shamrock assets, including the former Sigmor Petroleum assets founded by Thomas E. Turner, founder of TETCO Inc. (the Sigmor brand name was the initials of Sigfried Moore, Turner's former employer) which merged with Shamrock Oil and Gas in 1960 forming Sigmor Shamrock - which was merged into Diamond Shamrock in 1982. Turner later repurchased Mission Petroleum Carriers when it was acquired by Diamond Shamrock which was the foundation of TETCO,[5] and the business portfolio of the former National Convenience Stores, which was acquired by Diamond Shamrock in November 1995.[6]
On April 25, 2005, Valero agreed to buy Premcor, Inc., for $8 billion in cash and stock to become the largest U.S. refinery, as record prices for gasoline and other fuel boosted profits. On June 30, 2005, Valero announced that it was beginning a two-year process of converting Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand. In the next year, on May 5, 2008, Valero agreed to buy 72 Albertsons gas stations.
Valero laid off 500 employees at its refinery in Delaware City, Delaware on November 20, 2009, due to profitability concerns. It was reported the refinery had lost $1 million per day since the beginning of the year.[citation needed]
On March 11, 2011, Valero announced that it had agreed to a major European purchase from Chevron Corp. for $730 million in cash, not including working capital that will be determined at closing. Estimates on the value of the working capital would place the total price at $1.73 billion. The acquisition includes Chevron's Pembroke Refinery in Wales — one of Europe's largest and most complex — together with marketing and logistical assets throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, which include 4 pipelines, 11 terminals, an aviation fuel business, about 1,000 retail outlets, inventory and other items. [7] [8] [9]
In 2013, Valero spun off its retail operations into a new publicly traded company, CST Brands.[10] Under long-term supply agreements, Valero continues to supply fuel to over 7,400 retail locations, many of which use brand names formerly owned by Valero.[11]
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Valero 28th among corporations that emit airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on both the quantity (3.4 million pounds in 2005) and the toxicity of the emissions.[12]
Valero was the biggest[13] financial backer of the failed 2010 California Proposition 23 and contributed more than $4 million by August 2010.[14] Had it passed, Proposition 23 would have delayed action on greenhouse-gas emissions in the state of California by delaying current implementation of the California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 until the state attained an unemployment rate of 5.5% or less for one full year.[15][16] Critics argued that because that had happened only three times over the last 40 years, the proposition would have had the practical effect of repealing the law.[17][18]
Valero owns two oil refineries in California. The Benicia Refinery is located on the Carquinez Strait, a tributary of the San Francisco Bay.[19] The Wilmington Refinery[20] is located 23 miles (37 km) south from downtown Los Angeles.[21]
Valero's Wilmington (CA), Benicia (CA), and Port Arthur (TX) refineries are known to carry and process crude oil from the Amazon region of South America, a large concern for environmentalists trying to protect the Amazon rainforest. In 2015, Wilmington and Benicia processed about 13,000 barrels of Amazonian crude oil per day, combined.[22]
Defense contracts[edit]
According to Robert Bryce,[23] author and managing editor of Energy Tribune, Valero Energy Corp. has been awarded multiple multimillion-dollar contracts by the U.S. Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) in order to provide fuel to Israel.
Divestitures[edit]
Valero Energy reached an agreement to sell the assets of its terminal operation and discontinue operations in Delaware City to the wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy – Delaware City Refining and Delaware Pipeline – for approximately $220 million in 2010.[24]
Shortly after the divestiture of Delaware City, the company sold its refinery at the Port of Paulsboro to PBF Energy, as well. The sale concluded Valero's refinery ownership on the East Coast.[24]
Acquisitions[edit]
On August 1, 2011, Valero acquired the Pembroke Refinery from Chevron, as well as the marketing and logistics assets, for $730 million, excluding working capital, which was valued at approximately $1 billion. The Pembroke plant is one of the largest and most complex refineries in Western Europe with a total throughput capacity of 270,000 barrels (43,000 m3) per day and a Nelson complexity index rating of 11.8. This puts Valero at a total of 15 refineries and 2.9 million barrels (460,000 m3) per day of throughput capacity overall, solidifying the company’s standing as the world’s largest independent refinery.
Valero also purchased ownership interest in four major pipelines and eleven fuel terminals, a 14,000-barrel (2,200 m3)-per-day aviation fuel business, and a network of more than 1,000 Texaco-branded wholesale sites, which is the largest branded dealer network in the United Kingdom and the second-largest in Ireland. Valero has continued with the Texaco brand in these markets.
Retail[edit]




A typical Valero gas station in Mountain View, California






A Valero Gas Station in Haltom City, Texas on Western Center Blvd that opened in 1986 as Diamond Shamrock, fully converted to Valero in 2005.


Valero retails gasoline branded as Valero, Shamrock, Diamond Shamrock,[25] Ultramar, Beacon, and Total, the last under license from Total S.A.. While this arm of the company was the most visible to the public, it was, according to CEO William R. Klesse, "a very small part of [Valero's] operations".[26]
Valero attempted to shift its focus from being a discount gasoline brand to becoming a premium brand. As part of the shift, Valero began to rebrand its Ultramar, Beacon, Total, and Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand. The Beacon and Shamrock brands are used by retailers as a low-cost alternative to the premium Valero brand. The Shamrock brand is based on the former Shamrock Oil and Gas Company, which merged with Diamond Alkali in 1967 to form Diamond Shamrock, thus declaring the trademark from official abandonment. The name Ultramar, while being eliminated in the United States, continued as Valero's brand name in Canada. Valero introduced its updated "Corner Store" retail concept on December 28, 2007, opening the company's first 5,500-square-foot (510 m2) prototype in western San Antonio. The Corner Store retail division, originally part of Diamond Shamrock, was absorbed into Valero's business portfolio in 2001. Not all Valero gas stations included a Corner Store - one Valero gas station in Euless, Texas east of Fort Worth is co-branded with a 7-Eleven convenience store.
Creation of CST Brands[edit]
On July 31, 2012, during the 2nd Quarter Earnings Conference Call, Valero announced intentions to separate the retail business from the remainder of the company. CFO Mike Ciskowski stated "We believe the separation of our retail business by way of a tax-efficient distribution to our shareholders will create operational flexibility within the business and unlock value for our shareholders." [27] In 2013, Valero completed the spinoff of the retail operations as CST Brands.[10] Valero no longer owns retail operations using the Valero, Diamond Shamrock, Shamrock, Beacon, Ultramar, or Texaco names, but Valero continues to supply fuel.[11]
Credit cards[edit]
Valero issues its own private label credit cards for its stations through its credit card-only subsidiary, DSRM National Bank. The initials stand for "Diamond Shamrock Refining & Marketing", the unit of Diamond Shamrock which created it before being purchased by Valero.[28]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

To be eligible for this Program, your DSRM National Bank credit card account (Account) must be open and in good standing. If your Account is eligible for this Program, you will automatically be enrolled. You can only have one account enrolled in the Program at any given time. There are no fees for participating in this Program. If you do not want to be enrolled in this Program, you can contact us to request to be removed from the Program. This Program applies to Fuel Purchases on your Valero credit card received for billing during each billing cycle. Billing cycles occur at approximately monthly intervals. The number of days in your monthly billing cycle may vary. A four cent ($.04) per gallon Gas Rebate will be applied to every gallon of fuel purchased using your Valero credit card if the total gallons received for billing during the billing cycle are at least 50.0 gallons or more, up to 74.9 gallons. An eight cent ($.08) per gallon Gas Rebate will be applied to every gallon of fuel purchased on your Valero credit card if the total gallons received for billing during the billing cycle are at least 75.0 gallons or more, up to a maximum of 110.0 gallons received for billing during any billing cycle of the Program. A Gas Rebate for the purpose of this Program is defined as the amount you earn through Fuel Purchases and may receive through a reduction on your billing statement. Gas Rebates, subject to your account status being open and in good standing, will automatically appear on your monthly billing statement once earned and will be applied as a statement credit on the monthly billing statement. A Fuel Purchase for the purpose of this Program is defined as an electronic (card-swiped) purchase of fuel from any participating Valero, Diamond Shamrock, Beacon, or Shamrock branded retail location in the US charged to your Account. To calculate the Gas Rebate for eligible fuel purchases where the gallon information is not available, we will assign a value at our discretion, such as the average per gallon fuel price across our marketing network. Non-fuel purchases are ineligible for this Program. Fuel purchases on Valero commercial or fleet accounts are ineligible for this Program. If, after enrollment, your Account becomes delinquent or is closed to new purchases, your Fuel Purchases become ineligible for the Gas Rebates and any accrued Gas Rebates may be forfeited. Gas Rebates are not transferable. We reserve the right to change or terminate this Program at any time and in any manner, with or without notice. This Program is not valid with any other offer or program and may be void where prohibited. If you have questions about this Program, you can contact us at1-800-333-3560.DSRM National Bank Privacy NoticeFraud & ID Theft InformationTerms of Use for Valero Self Serve

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The remaining $14 million is for maintenance.Conference CallThe Partnership’s senior management will host a conference call at 10 a.m. ET today to discuss this earnings release.  A live broadcast of the conference call will be available on the Partnership’s website at www.valeroenergypartners.com.About Valero Energy Partners LPValero Energy Partners LP is a master limited partnership formed by Valero Energy Corporation to own, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products pipelines, terminals, and other transportation and logistics assets.

These statements discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking information. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “project,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “would,” “will” or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the Partnership’s control and are difficult to predict. These statements are often based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including examination of historical operating trends made by the management of the Partnership. Although the Partnership believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, the Partnership cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions.  When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in the Partnership’s filings with the SEC, including the Partnership’s annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available on the Partnership’s website at www.valeroenergypartners.com. These risks could cause the Partnership’s actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.Read MoreUse of Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis earnings release includes the terms “EBITDA,” “distributable cash flow,” and “coverage ratio.”  These terms are supplemental financial measures that are not defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany this release.  In note (l) to the tables that accompany this release, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release provides useful information.

For businesses that we acquired from Valero, those terms refer to Valero Energy Partners LP Predecessor, our Predecessor for accounting purposes for periods prior to their dates of acquisition. References in these notes to “Valero” may refer to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, other than Valero Energy Partners LP, any of its subsidiaries, or its general partner.We acquired the following businesses from Valero in 2016:On September 1, 2016, we acquired the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business for total consideration of $325.0 million.On April 1, 2016, we acquired the McKee Terminal Services Business for total consideration of $240.0 million.Each acquisition was accounted for as the transfer of a business between entities under the common control of Valero. Accordingly, the statement of income data, operating highlights, and capital expenditures data have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of operations of the acquired businesses for periods prior to their dates of acquisition.(b)  The increase in operating revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to $14.0 million and $36.6 million, respectively, of incremental revenues generated by the acquired businesses described in Note (a) and $2.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of revenues generated by our Red River crude system. Prior to being acquired by us, the businesses described in Note (a) did not charge Valero for services provided and did not generate revenues. Effective with the date of each acquisition, we entered into additional schedules to our commercial agreements with Valero with respect to the services we provide to Valero using the assets of the acquired businesses. This resulted in new charges for terminaling services provided by these assets. In addition, effective January 18, 2017, we acquired a 40 percent undivided interest in (i) the newly constructed Hewitt segment of Plains All American L.P.’s Red River pipeline, (ii) two 150,000 shell barrel capacity tanks located at Hewitt Station, and (iii) a pipeline connection from Hewitt Station to Wasson Station (collectively, the Red River crude system).(c)  The increase in operating expenses in the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to higher maintenance expense of $1.7 million at the Houston, St. Charles, Corpus Christi, and Three Rivers terminals, which was mainly related to inspection activity. In addition, we incurred total incremental expenses of $1.0 million related to our Red River crude system and the rail loading facility at our St. Charles terminal, which was placed in service in the second quarter of 2017.The increase in operating expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to total incremental expenses of $1.5 million related to our Red River crude system and the rail loading facility at our St. Charles terminal.(d)  The increase in general and administrative expenses in the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to higher public company costs of $156,000.The decrease in general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to transaction costs of $387,000 in 2016 associated with the acquisition of businesses from Valero.(e)  The increase in depreciation expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was attributed primarily to depreciation expense recognized on the assets that compose our Red River crude system, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2017.(f)  The increase in “interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to the following:Incremental borrowings in connection with the 2016 acquisitions. In connection with the acquisitions described in Note (a), we borrowed $139.0 million and $210.0 million under our revolving credit agreement. Interest expense on the incremental borrowings was approximately $1.3 million and $3.3 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.Incremental interest expense incurred on the senior notes. In December 2016, we issued $500.0 million of 4.375% senior notes due December 2026. We used the proceeds of the senior notes to repay $494.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The interest rate on these senior notes is higher than our revolving credit facility, thereby increasing the effective interest rate in 2017. Incremental interest expense resulting from these senior notes was approximately $2.3 million and $4.9 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.Higher interest rates in 2017. As a result of higher interest rates experienced in 2017, we incurred additional interest of $759,000 and $1.3 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, on borrowings under our subordinated loan agreements with Valero.(g)  The requirements under our partnership agreement for the conversion of all of our outstanding subordinated units into common units were satisfied upon the payment of our quarterly cash distribution on August 9, 2016. Therefore, effective August 10, 2016, all of our subordinated units, which were owned by Valero, were converted on a one-for-one basis into common units. The conversion of the subordinated units does not impact the amount of cash distributions paid or the total number of outstanding units. The subordinated units were only allocated earnings generated by us through the conversion date.(h)  Represents the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment divided by the number of days in the period. The increase in pipeline transportation throughput in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to volumes at our Red River crude system, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2017.(i)  Management uses average revenue per barrel to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate average revenue per barrel; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate average revenue per barrel as revenue divided by throughput for the period. Throughput is derived by multiplying the throughput barrels per day (BPD) by the number of days in the period. Investors and analysts use this financial measure to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance.(j)  Average pipeline transportation revenue per barrel was higher in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 due primarily to higher pipeline transportation revenue per barrel generated by our Red River crude system, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2017.(k)  Storage and other revenues was higher in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 due primarily to revenues generated by the rail loading facility at our St. Charles terminal, which was placed in service in the second quarter of 2017.(l)  Defined terms are as follows:EBITDA is defined as net income less income tax expense, interest expense, and depreciation expense.Distributable cash flow is defined as EBITDA less (i) EBITDA attributable to Predecessor and cash payments during the period for interest, income taxes, and maintenance capital expenditures; plus (ii) adjustments related to minimum throughput commitments, capital projects prefunded by Valero, and certain other items.Distribution coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total distribution declared.These terms are not defined under United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are considered non-GAAP measures. Management has defined these terms and believes that the presentation of the associated measures is useful to external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies, to:describe our expectation of forecasted earnings;assess our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded limited partnerships in the transportation and logistics industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of EBITDA, financing methods; assess the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders;assess our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; andassess the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, because EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.We use distributable cash flow to measure whether we have generated from our operations, or “earned,” an amount of cash sufficient to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distributions. Our partnership agreement contains the concept of “operating surplus” to determine whether our operations are generating sufficient cash to support the distributions that we are paying, as opposed to returning capital to our partners. Because operating surplus is a cumulative concept (measured from our initial public offering (IPO) date and compared to cumulative distributions from the IPO date), we use distributable cash flow to approximate operating surplus on a quarterly or annual, rather than a cumulative, basis. As a result, distributable cash flow is not necessarily indicative of the actual cash we have on hand to distribute or that we are required to distribute.We use the distribution coverage ratio to reflect the relationship between our distributable cash flow and the total distribution declared.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextConocoPhillips trims capex after posting quarterly lossReutersFirst Drive: 2017 Land Rover DiscoveryLand RoverSponsoredTrade of the Day: Phillips 66 (PSX)InvestorPlaceHigher oil prices boost ExxonMobil, Chevron earningsAFPOil Companies Trim Drilling Budgets in Sign of Rising CautionBloombergFast and Flavorful Fajitas with JohnsonvilleJohnsonvilleSponsoredWhat a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude pricesMarketWatchThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderChuck Schumer was on the verge of tears speaking about John McCain after Republicans' 'skinny repeal' bill failedBusiness InsiderThis Is How Homeowners Can Claim $4178 A YearFHA MortgageSponsoredHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderAmerican Airlines CEO Doug Parker: We're fighting like cr...CNBC VideosChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoCan A New Super-Coffee Make You Feel Young Again?VitaCupSponsoredStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceStruggling to govern, Trump faces growing Republican uneaseStuart: Actually this is the best our country can do right now.

Three recent acquisitions are paying off for San Antonio-based midstream company Valero Energy Partners LP (NYSE: VLP).
In its second quarter earnings, Valero Energy Partners reported making $58.4 million in net income on $110.5 million in revenue — marking six quarters in a row of revenue growth.

The second quarter figures mark increases from the $58.1 million of net income on $105.8 million in revenue during the first quarter and an increase from the $49.4 million of net income on $87 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2016.
Although the company's earnings per share of 69 cents missed analyst expectations by 6 cents, Valero Energy Partners saw a 26.1 percent increase on year-to-year revenue.




Valero Energy Partners attributed the growth to three acquisitions, including two drop downs from its parent company Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO).
As part of an August 2016 deal, Valero Energy Partners acquired storage terminals and other assets from the Valero's Meraux and Three Rivers refineries.
In January, Valero Energy Partners bought a 40 percent stake in a new 138-mile Hewitt segment of a Red River Pipeline in Oklahoma as part of a $70 million deal with Houston-based midstream company Plains All American Pipeline LP (NYSE: PAA).
Headquartered in San Antonio, Valero Energy Partners is a fee-based master limited partnership formed by refining company Valero Energy Corp. to own, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products pipelines, storage terminals and other assets.
Valero Energy Partners began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Dec. 11, 2013. The company's stock was trading just below $45 per share as of Thursday morning.
