The Velocity Fund is a non-equity grant program for startups. Each year Velocity produces three pitch competition events where the Velocity Fund awards $125,000 in money to winners.

Velocity is an entrepreneurship program at the University of Waterloo, made up of on-campus and off-campus programs. From idea to development to commercialization, Velocity provides the knowledge, tools, space and network that startups and entrepreneurs need for success.
The Velocity Fund $25K competition showcases 10 startups as they pitch for their chance to win one of four $25,000 prizes and space in one of the Velocity workspaces.

During the Velocity Fund $5K competition, three student ideas or student-driven startups receive $5,000 to help them grow their ideas and start their businesses.
