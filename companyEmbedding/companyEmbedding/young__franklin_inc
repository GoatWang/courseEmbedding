About Y&F 
Young & Franklin Inc. (YF) designs, manufactures and services products to control intake air and combustion fuel for industrial gas turbines used in the power generation and oil & gas markets. Original equipment manufacturers and asset operators worldwide look to YF for valves and actuators built with the highest quality, durability and reliability.
Established in 1918 and headquartered in Liverpool, New York, YF provides valves, actuators and other specialized controls to turbine manufacturers and operators across the globe. With an installed base of products running on more than 15,000 industrial gas turbines, YF has built a reputation of technical expertise and product excellence.
From the first fuel regulators and hydraulic power units to the latest in electromechanically driven valves and actuators, YF offers customers a wide range of products to ensure optimum gas turbine operation.
Products
Electromechanically Actuated (EMA) Gas and Air Control Systems
Offering a technology upgrade package consisting of the main gas turbine fuel and inlet air control devices, YF delivers customers the opportunity to replace complex hydraulically actuated controls with virtually maintenance-free electromechanical (EMA) systems that outlast, outperform, and outthink their hydraulic predecessors. YF EMA Gas Control Valves require no control or trip oil to operate in an existing system and range in line sizes from 1” to 6”. YF EMA Guide Vane Actuators are scalable with strokes up to 4” and forces up to 40,000 lbf.
Hydraulic Gas, Liquid Fuel and Air Control Systems
Having decades of experience as the OEM of many fuel & air delivery systems, YF offers new as well as zero-time warranted repair and overhaul services for legacy assemblies. Products in this category include Gas Control and Stop/Ratio Valves, Combined Gas Control/Stop Ratio Assemblies, Splitter/Transfer Valves, Severe Service Inlet Guide Vane Actuators, Nozzle Guide Vane Actuators, Liquid Fuel Stop and Bypass Valves, Pressure Sensing Pilot Valves, and Fuel Regulators. YF also has extensive experience with IGCC systems.
Design & Engineering
A design-to-build manufacturer, YF works with customers to select an existing design and modify it to fit their needs, or create a new design that best meets their specifications. YF utilizes functional modeling to verify performance during the design phase. This helps to ensure customer confidence with the final product early in development.
For each application, YF offers customers a variety of technical support services to ensure optimal control solutions before, during and after the sale.
YF application and sales engineering teams provide clients support and guidance in selecting appropriate solutions.

YF also employs sophisticated assembly and test processes with specialized tooling and a wide variety of test stands. Quality is ensured with multiple Coordinate Measuring Machines and Vision Inspection Systems.
Testing
Whether it’s proving actuators at forces up to 40,000 lbs or measuring positional accuracies down to 1 micron, each product endures an extensive qualification process before being deployed to the field.
The programmable nature of the test stands allow YF to work with customers to customize a test program to desired duty cycles under various environmental conditions.
Products are tested beyond their specifications to ensure performance margins resulting in high levels of durability and reliability.
Repair & Overhaul
At the main facility in Central New York, YF offers comprehensive repair and remanufacturing services for all products. A team of International Business Partners offer Authorized YF Repair & Overhaul services at locations worldwide for localized maintenance needs.

About Tactair Fluid ControlsFounded over 50 years ago, Tactair is an ISO9001-2008/AS9100 rev. C certified designer and manufacturer of hydraulic and pneumatic controls for the aerospace industry.  Acquired by Young & Franklin in 1986 and moved to Liverpool, New York (suburb of Syracuse), Tactair is a subsidiary of Young & Franklin Inc. and operated by an entrepreneurial management team with extensive aerospace engineering and manufacturing experience.
Since then, four additional proprietary aircraft fluid power control product lines have been acquired and integrated into Tactair's plant: Phoenix Controls in 1989, Teledyne's Hydra-Power division in 1992, Kaiser Fluid Technology in 2002, and York Industries' aerospace product lines in 2005.
The combined companies currently have approximately 280 non-union employees, housed in two ultra-modern manufacturing facilities with a total of 180,000 sq. ft.  Tactair continues to invest in its future through product development, ongoing acquisitions, and a strategy to remain a U.S. based manufacturer through modernization of equipment, facilities, and systems.
Tactair Perspective
Continuous Improvement and Investment
Tactair's modern manufacturing plant is equipped for the efficient production of close-tolerance component parts and complex assemblies. Our advanced equipment enables us to hold tolerances to tenths of a thousandth with matched clearances down to ten millionths of an inch. Primary machining is performed on CNC milling, turning, grinding and EDM equipment.  A full range of modern manual mills, lathes, laps, hones, and grinders complement our CNC capabilities.
Tactair has aggressively embraced the principles of lean manufacturing, investing heavily in appropriate machinery, such as 5-axis machining centers with multiple turrets, and processes.
Tactair's manufacturing is further enhanced by CAM and comprehensive production control (MRP II) systems.  Our fully integrated MRP II system includes order entry, purchasing, shop floor scheduling, inventory, and accounting modules.  This integrated system enables us to efficiently manage production and monitor customer order status in real time.
Integrated Process Control Assures Product Quality
Tactair is certified to ISO 9001-2008 and AS9100 rev. C by Lloyd's Register.  In addition, the major worldwide aircraft OEMs and their first tier suppliers have approved our quality system.
Our systematic approach to assured quality employs certified operator-inspectors and approved Statistical Process Control (SPC) on the manufacturing floor as an integral process control.
Quality is also designed into our new product development. Tactair's cross-functional Program Management teams (engineering, manufacturing, sales, purchasing, and quality assurance personnel) work together throughout the product development and prototype phase to ensure that each product is designed for manufacturability as well as for function.
Rigorous Testing Ensures Outstanding Performance
Tactair's extensive in-house hydraulic and pneumatic test facilities enable us to test our products to verify critical performance, efficiency, and environmental characteristics. All products are performance tested prior to shipment. Data is recorded and archived to support our design, quality assurance and customer support requirements. New product qualification testing is performed to simulate decades of service.
System Modeling Optimizes Our Development Process
Tactair is the designer for the majority of the products it manufactures. As such, our engineering capability is key to our future success. The Tactair design and engineering teams work together and use an extensive toolbox of computerized design and analytical tools, engineering test lab facilities with leading edge data acquisition, and a fully equipped model shop. Tactair's CAE/CAD systems support our design group with 3-D parametric modeling, dynamic and static system modeling, and finite element analysis.
Worldwide On-Demand Support
Tactair's Customer Support organization is a stand-alone operation with its own management team, inventory, repair technicians, and facilities. The repair station is licensed by both the FAA (T5TR698J) and EASA (145.5121) and offers its customers complete overhaul of all Tactair-produced equipment. Turnaround times of less than thirty days are the norm.
Spare component parts are also stocked and shipped throughout the world on a moment's notice. In addition, an AOG service is available seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, three hundred sixty-five days a year.
